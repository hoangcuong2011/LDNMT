I am not going to apologize , I want to put on record ...
if the situation is not rectified within three months the United States will ban the import into its territory of fish and fish products originating in Italy ; given the existence of the single market , this could affect the rest of the European Union as well .
finally , proposed Amendment No 44 , under which the regulation would enter into force on 1 September 2000 heads in exactly the same direction .
Mr Martin Schulz did not say a word when one of the secretaries of state of the Hungarian Government filed a criminal report against a Hungarian journalist for writing an article exposing legislative fraud , which resulted in the imprisonment of that Hungarian journalist .
in order to achieve these objectives , we propose that Parliament insist on certain priorities : firstly , we propose that OLAF draw up 27 profiles , analysing with due care and attention the strategies followed by each individual Member State in combating fraud and irregularities in the use of European resources , with a precise map of the authorities responsible for performing checks in each individual country and data on the quantity and quality of the checks performed and on their effects .
the Youth on the Move programme is an initiative that is central to the EU 2020 strategy .
as far as your questions relating to a system of social insurance and social security under the treaty are concerned , these systems are a Member State responsibility .
yes , far more could be done , but in Ireland &apos;s case we have a population of less than four million and too small a market to sustain a packaging manufacturing infrastructure .
we have made proposals as to the size of the plant sample which should be taken by the official inspectors , and have also proposed measures to be taken in the event of violations .
the effects of agricultural production on the environment are part of this debate , as is the question of social criteria for agricultural policy and the desire for a better quality of life , be it through higher food safety and quality standards , or through sustainable development of rural areas and considering the purposes they serve for our society .
the Scottish , my own country &apos; s national dress involves wearing a dagger in your sock .
all this cannot be achieved while reducing States &apos; contributions to the Community budget .
increasingly intensive farming , growing use of pesticides and fertilisers , the increasing size of agricultural holdings , the development of monoculture : agricultural biodiversity is particularly affected and is in an alarming state .
we are continuing our initiatives along these lines , and towards the end of the year I am glad to say that I shall be able to put before Parliament a report on what has been done in this area over the past two years .
in any case , the time has come to agree to an open , taboo-free debate on the question which is in all the heads not of Europe &apos;s adversaries but on the contrary of those who want to make it a success .
the External Action Service should coordinate the work of different Directorates-General and create a Directorate-General for cultural and digital diplomacy .
finally , there is a third group , and this third group , to which I myself belong , believes in this project but believes in it as a real political project , opening the way to a tolerant , pluralist Europe that is accepting of diversity .
I want the agricultural policy to be transformed into a system which is geared to market conditions .
I would also like to make two remarks regarding agriculture and horticulture .
this levy makes it possible to finance a conversion fund , so that workers who change jobs receive compensation which will contribute in large measure to removing their anxiety about the future .
Mr President , Rainer Böge ’ s report before us concerns the future financing of the EU .
this is very much due to the excellent work of Commissioner Rehn .
this is a change in the Rules which has political ramifications !
the Commission has very little experience in this field and I am entirely prepared to base the Commission ’ s considerations on the experiences and examples of best practices developed by certain Member States .
advertising has also made progress as far as content goes , but not necessarily only for the better .
this Parliament is in a crisis because we come under permanent attack by many of the public media in all the Member States for the indefensible state in which we are made to work at the moment .
we had a situation where foot-and-mouth came into the European Union .
it seems that forests were left without adequate anti-fire zones , without functioning emergency water points and reservoirs , without proper plans for fire-fighting or for the orderly evacuation of villages , without up-to-date fire-fighting equipment and without , in some cases , modern training for fire-fighters .
on the one hand he proposes a range of administrative measures , on the other a range of financial measures .
we were to be able to have access to any document , once the Commission had given it to others .
nanotechnologies also represent an opportunity , in my view , for smaller countries , and generally for smaller organisations .
forests also help to solve problems of soil erosion and degradation , water shortages and pollution , and to preserve the biological diversity of plant and animal species .
the amendments it proposes clarify and , in some cases , develop various aspects of the Commission &apos;s proposal , including some useful additions on force majeure subsidies and sanctions .
( RO ) We need a coherent , sustainable European policy in the transport sector which respects the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality .
it is therefore so important that this Amendment be voted down tomorrow , so that there may be a level playing field .
so my question is this : what range of information will be communicated to Parliament ?
when borders within Europe disappear , only Community legislation on asylum will be successful .
the whole process supports stability and we should keep up the momentum .
( DE ) Mr President-in-Office , in all the initiatives that the Council is taking in respect of Kosovo , will the views of Serbia and the information it provides also be adequately taken into account ?
such rootless people , desperate people , are easy prey to evil political manipulation , and that is why we see so much conflict and civil unrest in those countries .
he has the European patience – at which younger people can only wonder – to bring this work together .
this shows very clearly that the EU does not put the environment first but , rather , seeks the best for industry .
it is no longer being used to fight terrorism and serious crime , as was originally intended .
this represents a good bit of work on our part in the European Parliament , because we made major changes to the Commission draft .
despite propaganda that these were terrorists , in the main , they were , in fact , impoverished farmers from the north and around Bangkok , sections of the urban working class , and their families , who saw their protest as a struggle against the enormous poverty and hardship that they suffer .
this will furthermore have the perverse consequence of creating suspicion amongst the citizens of Members States and also of the candidate countries , and this report is thereby doing a disservice to the European Union .
we must put an end to such practices and we must hold the leaders of Israel accountable for their violations of international and humanitarian law .
it could check up on Member States to make sure that EU legislation is transposed within the required time limit .
we must not , though , misinterpret this saying to mean that we should do nothing .
regarding Mr Tannock &apos;s point , no one has ever managed to prove the allegations that the European Union provided the money to others and not to the government .
even so , I think I can say that with the new provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam , which re-establishes the Schengen manuals at the Community level , we have now made a great step forward , even though there will still need to be improvements , of that I am convinced .
in the early 1970s my father set up his own small business .
before the vote on Chad :
Mr President , I voted for this report on the exchange on information regarding , specifically , financial activities .
Mr President , all the problems can be found in the content .
but the Christian Democrats are even more hypocritical .
subject : Tightening up of press censorship in China
you have paid , Prime Minister , for your pretence at arbitration . You treated the minor economic – but so very understandable – egotistical concerns of Spain and Poland equally , but then gave in to the constant , arrogant , nationalistic blackmail from France , which is used to being the only country to gain anything from Europe .
cultural and linguistic diversity are matchless assets but sadly often stand in the way of widespread distribution .
I simply believe that after I have been pleading for years for prevention in Kosovo and that has not been achieved , one cannot say after ten years : we must take preventive measures .
it must play an important role , not only from the viewpoint of its seat on the Security Council , but also in terms of staff and delegations connecting the two bodies .
if we do not amend that system at the next intergovernmental conference , Mr Colajanni , the average time needed to ratify the agreements at national level will continue to be between two and a half and three years .
I see now the sense in the strategy that she is adopting .
what is needed ?
given that our President launched the establishment of this Institute at rather short notice without providing a suitable budget , and the Commissioner for Science and Research did not want the Institute at all , all the credit for its establishment goes to you , Mr Figel &apos; , because , as Commissioner for Education , you have worked to pacify those circles that were worried about the awarding of degrees and diplomas and about their own competencies .
I would urge you to address this matter in the Bureau .
but they are much more too .
the Euratom Treaty now makes it possible to have some freedom of choice : those States that wish to can develop this sector and this technology , in which Europe is the leader .
although artistic education is currently a compulsory subject in many educational systems , teaching models still vary considerably from one Member State to the next .
( SL ) I , too , would like to join those of you who wish to emphasise the need for the European Parliament to be fully representative and to work with a full complement of members as soon as possible .
such talk can have no constructive consequences for Europe and I think that we would be much better served if we developed a partnership with Russia .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - Mr President , there are different tools to sanction environment-conscious behaviour in our societies .
this sectioned Europe off nicely , and that was the end of it .
a few days ago , the Commission also organised a high level conference where banks , risk capital funds and small and medium-sized enterprises came together ; a meeting also attended by representatives from the European Parliament .
in the same vein , I should like to note the delay - some two years after the fact - in setting up procedures to determine responsibility for the Viareggio disaster .
what action does the Austrian Presidency intend to take to bring the collective pressure of the EU Member States to bear on Israel to persuade it for example to hand back the land it confiscated from the Palestinians and to repatriate Palestinian refugees ?
if everyone is clear what foundations we are working from , then enterprises will have a smaller administrative burden and governments will not need to compete for rates indiscriminately .
turning cooperation policy into a weapon for militant feminism , for example , which creates a lot of controversy in Europe itself , will undermine our status and power to act in other parts of the world .
in conclusion , I would like to emphasise that the Prestige disaster need never have happened .
the Commission thus initiated a new infringement procedure against Greece with a request for the fixing of penalty payments .
the Commission has to deliver on the areas for which it is responsible , particularly the completion of the internal market .
I have no wish to flaunt my authority . I am merely concerned for the smooth running of proceedings .
later this year the Commission intends to adopt a policy plan on legal migration which will constitute an important further step towards this balanced approach .
– Mr President , first of all my warmest congratulations to the Austrian Presidency on the work which it carried out and on the fact that it put the European Constitution back into the limelight during its six- month term of office .
this is the principle that implementing European cohesion policy in an enlarged Europe will consequently be much less balanced from the point of view of regional development , and cannot be achieved at the cost of the solidarity that we still owe to the cohesion countries , in the first rank of which is Portugal .
what initiative can Europe , the European Union , pursue ?
in writing . - ( EL ) The adoption of a strategy for the Danube Region will be the jewel in the crown of cooperation developed between Member States , local authorities , NGOs , civil society organisations and other stakeholders in the area at national or regional level .
here I am thinking of the Mediterranean countries , but also of Sweden , which is the European country which has accepted the largest number of refugees from Iraq .
in a letter to me dated 19 June 2003 Mr Martinez Fernandez , State Secretary for Coastline and Waterways in the Spanish Environment Ministry , acknowledges that this analysis of the Commission is correct .
alternative investment fund managers ( debate )
in addition , we need a phasing-out of HCFCs so that industry can prepare itself to slow down production gradually .
that is my first point .
it should be stated , of course , that Vietnam does not operate nor will operate for the time being any flights within the European Union .
firstly , how to restore confidence in the Lisbon strategy and how to improve the efficiency of its implementation .
fines , however , are often an unsuitable way of guaranteeing compliance with rest periods , which can only be possible when a vehicle is immobilised .
Commissioner Vitorino rightly cited a concern about this particular trade that would exist in any civilised community .
all these aspects are very important , and you will appreciate that , when analysed in terms of cost , their advantages are significant indeed .
within this context , the report reinforces the &apos; paternalistic &apos; role of the Union still further , to the point that it proposes linking the pillar relating to EU development aid to third countries with the &apos; security &apos; pillar , thus completely altering the nature and purpose of such aid .
the second issue is that notification of irregularities can take up to 39 months - more than three years .
Europe and the Member States should make these objectives their political priority and the focus of their efforts to build a future energy policy .
this means that the Ombudsman should apply the relevant Community law when dealing with requests from third parties for access to documents obtained by the Ombudsman in the course of his inquiries .
this would be in the best interests of the European Union and of the people of Ukraine who have suffered long enough from nuclear contamination .
and having said this in your language , I am afraid I will have to continue in German and I would ask you to put your headphones on .
finally , two important reports were adopted , one on children ’ s rights , and those of child soldiers in particular , and the other on the use of the European Development Fund and the discussions initiated on its budgetisation .
the progress made in relation to agricultural export subsidies , to the production and trade in cotton and access to markets free of tariffs and export quotas for the least developed countries is not inconsiderable .
the attractiveness of the European private company could be threatened by the threshold for employee participation being set too low .
( PL ) Mr President , the use of sanctions should become a real and effective part of EU foreign policy in the sphere of human rights .
of course , if agreements have been concluded , they must also be adhered to , especially as far as transport is concerned .
we were warned almost a week ago by the radio station Burma Democratic Voice that the Government had authorised the use of firearms , and prepared for a violent conclusion to the peaceful demonstrations .
only by wiping out capitalist profit as the ultimate purpose of the production process will we be able to stop illegal and dangerous production , processing and marketing methods .
of course a great many steps still need to be taken in the direction of transparent charges and extending the scope of and further reducing the uncontrolled charges made by mobile telephone companies .
within this framework , we need to cultivate and promote a common perception of security , which is why the creation of a system of common political and military training for crisis management is of especial interest to the presidency and we are already working on this .
we have received a number of tributes to my late friend , Mr Dankert .
what the EU needs , therefore , is better synchronisation of the measures taken by all consumer protection institutions .
taking that approach could have jeopardised the economic prospects not just of the countries concerned but of the whole of Europe too , for we are bound together by the single currency .
in spite of all the talk about subsidiarity , political power is progressively being transferred to the institutions of the European Union .
as far as I could hear - but I may have missed something - the President-in-Office of the Council did not mention the word &quot; trade &quot; at all .
I would like first of all to express my support for the Agreement and for the position held by the European Commission , as well as the opinion expressed by Mrs Langenhagen , Mrs Fraga and Mr Medina .
in the past , he might have languished for years without being brought back to court .
I should therefore like you to tell us , I should like to know if the basis for these talks between Turkey and Frontex is respect for the border between Greece and Turkey , in other words , recognition of , and respect for , the external borders of the EU .
but it does not stop there .
furthermore , in the communications sector , which has already been substantially liberalised , the emphasis is placed on competition in the broadband sector and on the internationalisation of production .
the issues being considered in this regard include the enforcement of existing legislation , cooperation between the various authorities , and also communication and awareness-raising .
the EU is involved in countless international connections , both with the Member States and in the context of development aid and at a multilateral level , and each of these offers the opportunity of effectively reinforcing gender equality .
as for the former , reference must be made , first of all , to Hungary &apos; s economic situation , which is continuing to improve , despite signs of the slowdown that are being felt everywhere .
ladies and gentlemen , at this crucial juncture , as the work of the intergovernmental conference nears completion , we must examine the European Union &apos;s priorities and ask ourselves how best we can serve the interests of the citizens of Europe to whom we are responsible .
it is not European Union policy to try to bring about change by coercive measures with the effect of increasing the economic hardship of the Cuban people . ’
the Mediterranean plays a highly significant part in the European Union fisheries sector .
the recent decisions of the NATO ministerial meeting in Berlin on the possibility of the WEU using the resources of the Alliance for its own peace-keeping operations make this dimension an objective to be pursued as a priority , and that includes the work of the Intergovernmental Conference , confirming complementarity with the vital transatlantic link in the context of a coherent plan for stability and security in Europe .
as discussed earlier today in the excellent report of my colleague Mr Stubb , it is the responsibility of the European Union and not the applicant countries to take care of integration capacity .
energy , of course , is not just any good or service .
enlargement is thus our opportunity to change our operating rules and ensure that they are based on greater transparency and stronger guarantees of the rights of citizenship , and also streamline our decision-making .
the second seeks to delete an exception foreseen for Belgium .
as governments prepare for the special European Council on 5 October in Dublin I ask the Members of this Parliament in this debate for their views on how we can best - all of us , including the Irish presidency - win support anew in this generation for the European Union .
in this case it is not legitimate , because it undermines a united approach on the part of the European Union and thereby obstructs the conclusion of an agreement that would apply to the whole territory of the European Union .
we now have to seize the opportunity to move forward two steps at once .
that is the point that we have to remember time and time again when it comes to agricultural matters .
Madam President , this is not the first time Mr Andrews has got to his feet in this House and made totally inaccurate statements .
will the type in question be rejected , or will the individual Member State only be able to accept a decision at an EU level ?
at the same time , and with a view to improving the monitoring of the budget &apos; s implementation , we expect the Commission to produce a definition of clear objectives for implementation and a timetable for this , and we will see how the timetable is being respected in the course of the year by means of sources of information that are now being made available .
there is a second objective , which concerns the area of trade , both on a bilateral level , but also in particular with regard to its concerted attack in the area of globalisation and the World Trade Organisation .
we need to address properly the problem of who moves to and who enters a Member State , intent on remaining on the fringes of society .
I do not want to link this question with your comments about the period &quot; before &quot; and &quot; after &quot; NATO &apos; s intervention , as we will probably touch on that issue at another point during this Question Time .
joint motion for a resolution on the decision of the European Patent Office on the cloning of human beings
it is specifically in matters such as these , Commissioner , that I see it as important that non-governmental organisations should be brought on board , but please allow me to comment on what you have just said in your conclusion .
Afghanistan &apos;s southern provinces are most affected , with 70 % of all the production .
it is unfortunate , however , that the European Commission has been rather slow in dealing with this matter .
but it was Mrs Green who initiated this shambles .
it is certainly annoying that the Council has not yet been able to agree on a common position ; that is why we are calling on the Council to reach agreement as quickly as possible , taking account of Parliament &apos;s position , and on the Commission to withdraw its draft notice .
B5-0148 / 01 by Mrs Dybkjær , on behalf of the ELDR Group , on Nigeria ;
the European Commission has suitable instruments and mechanisms available for monitoring and adjusting Member States &apos; finance policies .
Madam President , Commissioner , the great interest which you have witnessed in this House today - even though you yourself are not responsible for fisheries - has , I hope , made it clear how much our ideas deserve support , both in the Committee on Fisheries and in the Commission .
the EU will similarly respect its political undertakings .
to uphold and protect it , and to respect its diversity and its political , social and cultural missions , is the mandate of all governments . &apos;
I fear , above all , an internal rift about the attitude with regard to America &apos;s role in the world , and hence about how to tackle the major breeding grounds of conflict .
I hope they are not entirely too late , but I believe we should realise that we could have made an earlier start , for instance last October .
their exclusion is unjustified , because these actors have specific interests and play just as active a part in decision making as many other representative associations .
finally , once again I thank Mr Blokland for his hard work on a constructive and valuable report .
as the rapporteurs correctly point out , this Treaty strengthens democratic responsibility and decision-making powers , and in this way gives citizens more control over the Union &apos;s activities .
I tell them with great regularity that they should be quicker .
on behalf of the ITS Group . - ( NL ) Mr President , it is often the case that different standards are applied to China , where human rights are concerned , than to countries where lucrative contracts are unlikely to materialise .
I believe , and several people have already touched on this today , that dual pricing could and should be applied for three years by authorities ranging from municipalities , cities , districts and regions to major state institutions , in setting and assessing charges and also in paying salaries and so forth . In this way people will be able to familiarize themselves with the euro by 2002 and will be able to relate it to their national currency and convert as a matter of course .
the ELDR Group would regret that because we think that , like refugees , beneficiaries of subsidiary protection should be in .
it is akin to my asking us to debate the result of the Madrid city council elections now .
this package would finance the creation of national resettlement programmes where they do not exist already , as well as coordination of activities at the central level .
it is certainly important to mention that the European Parliament is not silent .
at the moment , China is running a race by taking measures , by putting the necessary arrangements in place , by preparing a five-year plan on how exactly it intends to change its industry , by closing polluting industries , because it is competing with us on a huge market , the USD 13 billion clean energy market .
for many years , the identity cards of Members of the European Parliament have been accepted at Swiss borders for crossing into and out of Switzerland .
this debate on the safety of transfusions and self-sufficiency in blood and blood products raises an important social issue .
thank you very much , Commissioner .
we have to bring home much more effectively to the public that , through our external policies , we are increasingly and effectively promoting their interests , their priorities and their values .
the next item on the agenda is Mr Barton &apos;s recommendation for a second reading on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council Directive on the masses and dimensions of certain categories of motor vehicles and their trailers and amending Directive 70 / 156 / EEC ( C4-0632 / 96-00 / 0348 ( COD ) ) ( A4-0102 / 97 ) .
many thanks .
Mr President , I should first like to express my support for what my colleague Mrs Grossetête has said , and then to indicate that I totally support the European Commission &apos;s proposal for the scope of this directive to be extended to include products derived from agriculture and stock breeding , in the hope of providing better consumer protection .
the question now arises as to what the European Union can do about this state of affairs .
I am sure that colleagues here are aware that the Commission came back with a series of responses to those questions which , to my Group , were satisfactory enough for us to grant discharge .
if , in the worst case scenario , the Suez Canal should be blocked , how prepared are we as a Union to ensure security of supply ?
transparency and open dealing must be paramount and this report must and will be dealt with when the judicial process is completed .
it is a priority for the European Commission , and I have to say quite frankly that the acts of violence and sadism that appear in some particularly bloody videogames are a cause of great concern to us .
the programmes are now causing disappointment to many people , and the budget for Socrates , for example , is completely inadequate relative to the number of applications and the level of support needed .
there are very specific points : we need referendaires in the Court of First Instance because the European Union has failed to fill vacancies for judges , we need upgraded posts and we need improved translation services .
( SV ) Mrs Malmström , I know that the Presidency has held several constructive conferences and has spent a lot of time on this matter .
this House has , over the last few months , spent hours and hours in detailed work , passed by this plenary , on the Agenda 2000 package .
furthermore , in view of the many interesting developments taking place internationally to thrash out a strategy to combat corruption , the report outlines and assesses priorities , as well as identifying some urgently needed initiatives .
two wrongs do not make a right .
only solidarity will allow us to act effectively in our relations with Russia .
we are therefore at an impasse and I cannot exclude the possibility that we may attempt an agreement with the Council for just one year , 1999 , and defer the overall agreement for the following four years of the framework programme until after the revision of the financial perspectives .
a dialogue is now being conducted which still does not include all the parties in Algeria .
as rapporteur , I have from the very outset been particularly concerned to maintain the distinction between the testing of new types and new models .
back in September , I believed you were on the right track .
Europe already has the greatest purchasing power in the world , and cheap imports make us even stronger in this respect .
as many have pointed out , green technology already exists .
but perhaps you can resolve another little problem for me .
do you intend to stop using the hospitals and clinics we have provided ? &apos;
so , on monetary instruments the whole package is now complete .
otherwise , we could say of the budget &apos;s content that the EU &apos;s functions are adequately financed .
this requires not only the rapid introduction of the energy tax - and here I would thank Mr Monti for his energetic work - but also a social and environmental situation and also a Union .
in the media it seems that Tony Blair would be the person .
Madam President , I voted for Mr Varela &apos; s report on the Republic of Guinea fisheries agreement , even if prawns and tuna will not look very favourably on this report which regulates catching them .
why do we still need to keep alive the idea of a Europe that is bureaucratic , unclear and , even worse , incites fear , and evades clarity ?
could the Commission outline what investigations or reports it has carried out regarding food products which claim health benefits ?
this year the ceiling is 208 million euros .
second banking directive
when you read the European Environment Agency reports that glaciers in Switzerland retreated by 10 % in one year alone , in 2003 , you think that maybe he has a point , that we are just not realising what is happening .
in my opinion , the proposed solutions will increase the efficiency of the European public tender system in the field of defence .
why is this so ?
some difficult choices will have to be made at this point to allow a reduction in the EU budget .
one is the question of financial aspects of the Agenda 2000 .
we are delighted and proud of his new position .
it stands to reason that we shall be appealing against yesterday &apos; s decision and that , obviously , we ask for an interim order to suspend the effects of the judgment .
to be truly effective there must be a role for the trade unions in monitoring its effectiveness .
thank you , Mrs Gradin .
third-country nationals who might not be as highly educated and trained as their EU colleagues are employed instead .
there has also been mention of the need to simplify administrative procedures and the freight transport chain , and to make transport that does not rely on the road network more attractive .
if the costs in one country rise faster than in the rest of the EU , there is a certain rule in the Community that provides for this .
contrary to all dictates of common sense , its advocates acclaim it as the last hope of preventing climate change ; in so doing , they are simply replacing one evil with another .
&apos; What documents ? &apos; I asked her .
we said it in 2004 , we asked for acknowledgement of the genocide in 2004 and in 2005 we said it had to be a precondition .
the ultimate objective of these agreements is the creation of a future area of free provision of air services between the United States and the European Union , which will conform to the Lisbon Strategy and enhance transatlantic relations , which are so necessary .
one of these steps might be the redefinition of the EU budget to ensure our own funds to combat climate change .
as suggested in the report , I can assure you that we are continuing efforts on the CCCTB and on the coordination of Member States &apos; direct tax systems .
 
one carries the message that the European internal market needs the best possible consumer protection .
lastly I wish to express my disappointment that the majority in Parliament rejected the amendments tabled by our group , which called on Israel to abide by United Nations resolutions and the recommendations made by the International Court of Justice , and which sought to bring to the top of our list of priorities the need to put an end to the impasse in the peace process , to military occupation , to the settlements , to the wall , to assassinations , to detentions , to refusals to release prisoners , to the violence to which the Palestinian people are subjected and to the dramatic fall in their living conditions .
you can trace something of a logical progression linking these disturbances with cuts in taxes , cuts in expenditure , and cuts in social spending .
furthermore , we are facing a deepening economic crisis , environmental problems and the challenges brought by climate change , none of which can be resolved by military force .
it must be more rigorous in requiring states to reduce their debt when growth exceeds 3 % .
indeed , the citizen who is positively disposed towards this society has no way of gaining an overall picture .
Mr President , Commissioner , we are dealing with the new annual report on the situation of fundamental rights in the European Union which , owing to the method used for its production - a different political group every year - makes it impossible for the final result to reflect a consensus - which furthermore is necessary - of all the groups in this House .
it is my decision .
we urgently need definite proposals for the promotion of environmentally friendly products .
the proposal also lays down the benefit for dealerships whose contract has come to an end of being able to continue to operate as official dealerships of their brand for as long as they satisfy the quality requirements .
I sent a letter to the Swedish presidency requesting permission to attend the Ecofin meeting where the discharge is adopted .
despite the interesting progress contained in the Amsterdam Treaty , cooperation between the forces of order and criminal systems is still far from satisfactory , because all too often developments come up against the obstacle of national sovereignty , and we forget that the absence of effective cooperation at EU level does not serve the people , only the criminals .
that is why we are taking this opportunity to reiterate , in particular , our outright opposition to night working where this is not socially indispensable , as it is then merely another way to increase profits at the expense of workers &apos; health .
it is true that employers bear responsibility for illegal employment .
Mr President , electromagnetic fields can be a danger to public health . According to various scientific studies , they can lead to the development of cancerous cells .
Mr President , I should firstly like to thank Mrs Mann for her report , which we support . I should also like to express my appreciation to the Commissioner for his efforts towards developing the best possible transatlantic relations .
the general guidelines of the reforms that must be implemented and that have been highlighted in our report are indicative of reformist thinking firmly rooted in the core values of the European social model .
this proposal can be implemented quickly .
the PNR system will remain unchanged , the same as it is now , the same as it has been adopted and approved , and this is not about fingerprints being taken at travel agents &apos; or anywhere else .
previous FVO reports on both residue control measures and controls in the organic food sector in Germany will also be taken fully into account .
we are currently preparing the first meeting of this forum , and for this reason too Jordan is thus in an advantageous position to breathe life into this Agreement .
there is China - India &apos; s great neighbour , a great market , an Eldorado for many of our fellow Members .
countries must decide for themselves what ethical standards they are going to employ .
we realised at the public hearing , with sadness , disappointment and surprise , that very little money is available for research into diseases which afflict women particularly frequently , such as osteoporosis , the consequences of the menopause and breast cancer , the subject of today &apos;s debate .
rapporteur . - ( FR ) Mr President , Mr President of the European Central Bank , ladies and gentlemen , the annual report of the European Central Bank always offers an opportunity for the European Parliament to review monetary policy and to supplement the work carried out by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs through the monetary dialogue conducted four times a year with the President of the European Central Bank .
- Before the vote on Amendment 62
just imagine replacing the words &apos; environmental legislation &apos; with &apos; economic legislation &apos; or anything else , and you would consider it absolutely natural that you have access to justice ; that you allow these groups access to justice or a say on these issues .
hormone treated meat
we must , of course , fight for a substantial increase in financial resources , but we need the European Union to demonstrate a true political will in order to ensure the success and widespread adoption of these measures .
the facts are relatively clear .
all that is left to play is the part of Pluto , the dog that keeps guard over American interests .
it really is a scandal for any civilized country just to stand by and watch even though it knows the extent of the misery in that country .
in this case , new and streamlined does not mean better , and that needs to be rectified as a matter of urgency .
with due respect to those Member States that exercise best practice , believe me , there is no ideal country in respect to consumer protection .
I would also draw Parliament &apos;s attention to the risks that this would pose in the long run .
this is a general regression for women in the European Parliament .
on the other hand , we have the impression that , despite everything , the Council wants to advance very carefully , as if it were already convinced that the financial perspectives would be even more unfavourable than at present in terms of resources .
there were therefore no great difficulties in supporting the majority of the proposals tabled by Mrs Gill .
it is still rather too early to make a proper assessment of the operation of this new mechanism , but initial impressions indicate that the Member States are taking it seriously and acting responsibly .
also , we have to make it clear that we will not tolerate war crimes and other criminal activities and that we have the clear intention of bringing criminals to book once there is an agreement .
the Commission is attempting to satisfy Germany , without regard for any harm which may be caused to the fundamental principles of European construction , such as financial solidarity .
( RO ) Madam President , I think that both the mine closure proposal and the suggestion to reduce subsidies would be too premature and that they would have undesirable socio-economic and regional repercussions .
in conclusion , I want to emphasise that it is especially important for us to show today that we are not following the Member States &apos; stricter line .
if those principles and methods had been applied to technological and industrial ventures such as Airbus and Ariane , Europe would probably not have its own aircraft manufacturer or space launcher today .
we should therefore not dispose of the handling of cargo .
it has to be results-orientated and offer a greater capacity to respond .
the regulations provide for this .
I am not going to explain in detail everything that we set out in this resolution , but I shall perhaps instead point out what messages the Committee on Industry , Research and Industry wished to put across with it .
- ( DA ) The report &apos; s detailed requests to the Commission and the Council are based upon an appealing ambition to improve legal protection for asylum seekers in relation to the rights applicable under the Convention and particularly with regard to the procedure for dealing with asylum seekers .
the partnership &apos;s ultimate objective is to create in 2015 a Euro-Latin American global interregional cooperation zone in the areas of politics , economics , trade , and social and cultural affairs , thereby ensuring sustainable development in both regions .
what are your priorities here ?
I agree with the rapporteur over the need to simplify fishing rules by coming up with a regulation that can implement the recommendations adopted by the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean in a single piece of legislation .
so what does the Council do ?
in the name of this security offensive , Jean Charles Menezes , a Brazilian citizen , was brutally and appallingly murdered on his way to work by the British police force , putting into practice its policy of shoot first and ask questions later .
Parliament , which cannot be sanctioned in this institutional system , cannot constantly change the majority or use the motion of censure , except in cases of extreme political danger .
if so , she will not only make me happier , but a lot of young people happier too .
principally , the planned financial means must be increased and distributed amongst Member States using objective criteria .
I am glad because the Commission adopted my opinion unanimously .
that is why - like it or not - we need tougher control at European level , and that is why I am convinced we need a European coastguard .
the approach suggested in that interim report is followed in the proposal we are considering here tonight .
it would be rather absurd if they had to be told for the second month running : &apos; come back again next month &apos; .
I hope the Commissioner tonight will not simply support the principle of training in this respect , but will also commit himself to beginning to deliver it in practice .
it even goes so far as to impose a ban on fur from animals caught in leghold traps and to allow for its lifting when agreement has been reached with third countries to stop leghold use .
I am interested to see that he has maintained today his 100 % record of turning up and defending the interests of the British fishing industry ... by his absence here !
we have fought on behalf of the EU by pointing out the circumstances to the President of Belarus , but the President goes on as before , just the same .
thank you for the very full information you have been kind enough to give us , Commissioner .
semantic gobbledy-gook is of no interest to Parliament .
worryingly , Saudi Arabia &apos;s brand of fundamentalism , Wahabi Islam , is being exported globally .
this matter of fisheries brings to light an institutional quirk which may help to explain the apparent weakness of the Union in the day-to-day handling of its problems .
I hope that that goes for other Members also .
in the Lisbon agenda you will see a crystal clear reference to the open coordination method .
as soon as news of the earthquake broke , ECHO &apos;s emergency response system was mobilised .
we must also acknowledge , despite the significant advances made by the directive in relation to reception conditions - as mentioned in particular by my colleague Mrs Lefrançois , whose observations I fully support - we must acknowledge that the Member States still have too much room for manoeuvre on this issue .
if they can , they leave the country .
only an independent Kosova will bring true peace to the region .
in reality , we have sound legal bases on which to act against wage discrimination .
many States have already applied those recommendations and there are a lot of awareness-raising activities going on to discuss this issue .
how , then , is that to be done ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am pleased to hear that both the President-in-Office and the Commissioner have taken stock of the first four months and have come to the conclusion that the climate surrounding relations between the Union and Turkey and the potential for discussion have improved .
this is a project , incidentally , which has already been in preparation for five long years .
Europe , the European Union is crying out for such successes .
approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
I hope the Commission has received similar correspondence .
many of the residents of our country agree that the main reasons motivating people to study are constantly growing labour market requirements and better self-improvement and self-expression opportunities ; however , for half of our citizens their age has become a barrier , as they believe they are too old to study .
another important point that seems to have been overlooked is that controls are carried out .
it is because the proposals do not reflect the accuracy of the analysis that we are going to abstain on this report .
it would also be quite feasible , in cases where the rules are repeatedly broken , to withdraw licences from offending shippers , thereby preventing them from transporting cattle again at all .
negotiations should be based on international law and respect previous agreements .
most errors were detected in payments relating to agricultural policy and structural measures - in other words , in those management areas which the Commission shares with the Member States , and which account for some 80 % of the budget .
although two payments have been made by the European Union , not one brick has been laid .
the amendments to this report were tabled by myself .
the issue is whether we have a common set of norms in Europe which govern us all .
the proposals are excellent , and , if we combine our efforts , we really can get it over and done with very quickly – at first reading , indeed .
nothing is clear !
one core element of the Single European Sky is the creation of functional airspace blocks ( FAB ) based on traffic flows rather than national borders .
I am doubly proud today because a country the size of the country which I represent has produced leaders who demonstrate that they can talk without mincing their words and who can also stand as leaders beyond the borders of their own country .
the fact that this murder took place with the silent approval of Pakistani spiritual leaders , and that local lawyers support the murderer , means that murder on grounds of religious intolerance is tolerated in Pakistani society .
hitherto , the drive for the building of this Union has come from within .
actually the Council completely ignored the fact that we had unanimously adopted 22 applications and my report here .
that , however , can only be implemented if we can overcome the attitude towards cooperation in the European Union that we have exhibited until now .
furthermore , this agreement does not go nearly as far as the agreements with Canada and Russia , which many of us considered inadequate when we were consulted .
Europe is a continent rich in forests and forests are tremendously important .
I cannot draw up an exhaustive list of all the priorities , but rest assured that I share them .
what annoys me most about the present report is the recommendation that we should no longer speak of &apos; illegal immigration &apos; , but of &apos; irregular immigration &apos; , as it is now called .
in particular , it is impossible to verify the origin of catches .
we are employing energy ever more rationally .
the June List therefore chooses to vote against the reports in spite of their being , in terms of their objectives , justified and worth taking seriously .
however , I think that this expression alone is most telling .
I agree with the Commissioner that we should not get cold feet now , simply because we now have the difficult chapters to negotiate and each of the members and candidates are of course defending their own interests with vehemence and conviction .
at the same time our Parliament does not want to intervene too hastily .
there is a great deal of talk about employment effects .
first of all , the report is lacking in the evaluation of the EU human rights policy .
the common foreign and security policy should be made more efficient .
if every bit of data that passes through the server every second is to be monitored , we forfeit what basically has made the Internet successful and has increased productivity in countries with high Internet use , namely the fact that everyone gets to be involved and to share knowledge .
now that the initial battle has been fought , we expect the Commission to propose a policy soon so that we can complete the second reading before the end of this year .
they have gained experience and have also had some success .
indeed , the fact that part of the putative future Palestinian state is ruled by Hamas , which is committed still to Israel &apos;s annihilation , is surely the biggest obstacle to peace .
the Union should not take a single step backwards in terms of its policy on climate change .
I therefore believe that these resources should be used for developing the flexibility margin and not for developing structural funds .
given the Commission ’ s failure to investigate new scientific and other evidence on fluoride in drinking water via the Commission ’ s Scientific Committee on Toxicity , Ecotoxicity and the Environment ( CSTEE ) as promised in May 2000 , this failure now threatens the credibility of the new Drinking Water Directive ( DWD ) .
( Uproar )
we have to wait for the Commission proposal to see how the Commission manages to reconcile the two requirements you mentioned : protection of the producer , especially the poorer producer , and conformity with the WTO rules .
under these circumstances , it is clear that were Mr Brie a Member of the Bundestag he would enjoy immunity from prosecution which has been launched against him .
on the one hand , they are unbalanced and place too great a burden on the vendor , and possibly the producer .
tour operators are starting to think , as a way out , of offering disaster tourism , as we in Galicia are very fond of black humour .
I have to tell the Commissioner that I find his first objection incomprehensible .
one senses a diffuse anxiety seeping through his report which contrasts happily with the steadfast optimism of the various advocates of the euro , together with reaffirmation - somewhat timid but reaffirmation nonetheless - of a few basic principles , all of which are superfluous .
the Commission carries out its work in utter transparency , constructively of course , trying to save an idea that , if it is well presented and carried out within a Community approach , could contribute added value to our efforts at governance , unlike what some of you have said .
for that reason , I voted against this report , although obviously without doubting the goodwill behind their objectives .
the FAO has undertaken a series of inspection missions in the candidate countries in recent weeks and months .
I would now like to turn to the issue of genetically modified rape , as I know that the European Commission is currently working on a proposal to authorise such rape .
I therefore call for the measures now being proposed not to be confined just to oil prospection and extraction but to include oil transport and supply as well .
we must reduce this gap if the spurt of growth that will result from enlargement is not to give rise to social and political tensions in this part of the Baltic region , for the real danger is of the development gap leading to potentially explosive social and political tensions .
the job of the EU must be to support the cooperation which is already taking place and which is now growing spontaneously between the peoples and not to automatically create new structures .
I also believe that one of the reasons for the possible incorporation of Schengen into EU regulations is an attempt to create a more unified and homogeneous State .
I take up your invitation Mr President and I should look forward to the visit very much .
I will , of course , gladly undertake to keep you personally informed of what is going on in this very important field .
while the budget for FP7 is far from what we wanted , it is even more important that we maximise the benefit between the synergies of the two funding streams .
is it not right for consumers to know where the clothes they wear come from ?
the financial preaccession aid for Turkey has been doubled in 2000 and 2001 compared to the average annual amounts which were allocated in the 1996-1999 period .
clearly , he acted disloyally with regard to the common position he was bound by .
the work of the Code of Conduct Group is ongoing .
ladies and gentlemen , one of our fundamental duties nowadays as politicians and citizens is to preserve our European cultural heritage for future generations .
reach is a very important legislative initiative to improve environmental protection and human health and , when it is applied , it will significantly increase the knowledge which we have about chemicals , improve their safety and strengthen consumer confidence in the chemicals with which they come into contact .
of course we are up against limitations set out in the Accession Treaties of the 10 new Member States .
it is true that in Europe rarely happen , but they do happen .
the question arises : What kind of benchmarks ?
particular attention must be given to North-South networks .
the next item is the report by Mr Gargani , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs , with recommendations to the Commission on succession and wills ( 2005 / 2148 ( INI ) ) .
but once again , thank you , Commissioner , for your willingness to step in .
it is now necessary , and this is our specific proposal as radical members of the Bonino List , in compliance with international law and the rules of war , that experts be consulted as a matter of urgency .
when , at the end of our term of office , we hand over the whole project with its roadmap , when our work is completed , they will need – so it has been said – about twelve months , possibly more : going on past experience , 18 months will be needed to fine-tune the finished product ; that means the beginning of 2006 , January / February 2006 .
- ( SV ) In the discussion of the Menrad report , a lot of important questions concerning equality were taken up .
the unrest is exacerbated by the Indonesian Government &apos;s exploitation of the province &apos;s gas and petroleum resources as well as the policy of transmigration which has seen many Javanese come to live and work in the province &apos;s coastal and industrial belts .
Commissioner , we have a lot of work to do in the run-up to Bali .
a more detailed scrutiny of Turkish legislation and its approximation to the acquis will be in the forefront .
I would like to propose to you a method which is used here in some European States when they can no longer pay pensions . In Italy , for example , a law is passed stating that a certain category of citizens will no longer receive pensions .
one has to exercise excessive caution .
Mr President , yesterday we placed on Wednesday &apos;s agenda the vote without debate on an interinstitutional agreement on the financing of the common foreign and security policy .
this question is particularly important because the bigger the vehicles that manufacturers produce , the bigger their profit margins .
adjournment of the session
unfortunately the position is not hopeful at the moment insofar as the United Kingdom is concerned , but who can tell what might happen .
even if the two objectives of cloning are different , there is clearly a great danger of opening the door to a kind of automatism when we do not at present have the means to control this area .
pursuant to the Pittella report , the sector audit analysed the competition situation regarding payment systems , including card systems , credit offices , cooperation between banks and price and bank settlement policies .
and we know that the US Administration publishes an annual human rights report covering virtually the whole world , but of course they have the huge resources to do that .
I must confess that it is just a touch embarrassing to note yet again that Europe is deeply divided on this .
I shall quickly go through five of them :
a moment ago , rapporteur Gill gave her support to my amendment for a few bicycles , so that parliamentarians can cover short distances cheaply and sustainably .
I endorsed the report because the added value of EU membership in multilateral organisations lies in the fields where it has exclusive or shared competences : economic and trade matters , environmental policy , development aid , and security and defence policy .
it was supported by the European Parliament when it approved the Thomas report .
I believe that over the last few years a lot has been achieved by the work of the Commission in particular .
this principle has already been accepted by the European Parliament in the Randzio-Plath report , and I call for the Commission ’ s support in the decisions to be taken before the end of this year .
we need more commercial freedom and more commercial responsibility .
Kyoto should not remain an empty pledge .
it was always clear , from both the Council and the Commission , that Member States had the choice of the system to allocate radio frequencies .
the EU must be better prepared to respond to new developments and to live up to international responsibilities .
we must fight for this progressive line .
a revision of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme will provide greater stability for investments and accelerate the momentum to cut greenhouse gases .
development cooperation itself is , of course , dealt with in other fora , but ASEM is and should remain a forum for dialogue among equal partners .
meanwhile , attempts have been made to force a territorial and administrative reorganisation plan in Romania , which would create eight majority megaregions , forcing the Hungarian majority living in Szeklerland and Partium into absolute minority .
what we need to know is the assessed impact on jobs in Europe and the extent to which pollution might simply be exported to low-income countries which can ill afford to cope with it .
thirdly , the police forces of all participating countries must be encouraged to negotiate obstacles which would hinder extensive collaboration .
fortunately , as a society , we are living longer and that is why our governments must plan for the demographic changes for the future .
a further package of measures concerning agreement on how to reconcile staff members &apos; professional and family activities is then needed .
follow-up to the report on competition in professional services ( debate )
I only hope that when they come to implement the programme &apos;s measures - and we shall be watching them very closely , as Mrs Wemheuer has quite rightly stated - the Member States show a greater awareness of the boost that these measures will give to the promoting of the European spirit .
the legal basis now coming into existence will also permit the financing of the work of the European Bureau of Lesser-Used Languages and the Mercator network , as well as concentration camp sites as historical memorials .
moreover , as long as the participating states do not see any actual possibility of these projects coming to fruition , they will surely not sacrifice existing good bilateral relations for the sake of a vague project .
the call for a responsible approach towards the Arctic is an SOS and an issue of global governance .
14 . Protocol on the Implementation of the Alpine Convention in the field of Transport (
unfortunately this does not mean that there is nothing left to be said about this issue .
if the Interinstitutional Group on Information confirms this proposal at its meeting later today , we will suggest that an additional EUR 1.5 million should be committed for the PRINCE programme .
father Saji from my village has asked our parish to pray for the victims , but we can do more than that .
mayors and governors elected by the people have been victims of pressure and murder from terrorists .
we are taking action on water management but we are not , I regret to say , in a position to support the micro-project proposals because again we lack the staff to manage them properly .
with a fair wind , it will come into effect by the time that the final fruition of that single market is achieved with the currency reforms at the end of this century .
we know this is a complex administrative issue , but many of the niceties of exclusion of certain benefits and complex rules simply appear as barriers .
good luck and success to the President , to the European Parliament and to the European Union !
this is an unacceptable resolution , which essentially absolves Israel of the genocide of the Palestinian people and occupation of its territories .
it is indeed known to the Commission that the former member of the Court of Auditors who was implicated in an inquiry carried out by OLAF took legal action in Greece against a former official of the Court of Auditors who testified against her during the OLAF investigation .
subject : Cultural cooperation between the European Union and international organizations
some people even maintain that the development of various types of financial participation systems could be a possible way of achieving increased growth and faster compliance with the Lisbon strategy objectives .
the fact that we do not have the Council here is a problem , of course .
the Sakharov prize does not always mean that things actually get better , as is apparent from the position of Aung San Suu Kyi , still held under house arrest in Burma .
the average import price is EUR 8 , while every one of us knows that shoes in a shop normally cost many times more than that .
in addition , practical measures , such as the use of electronic invoices , should be encouraged in parallel with the implementation of the directive .
the oral question by Mrs Mazzoni , on behalf of the Committee on Petitions , on asthma inhalers - B7-0666 / 2010 ) .
it is the thin end of the wedge .
the Commission disagrees with you and feels that your question comes within Mr Bangemann &apos;s competence and not Mr Van Miert &apos;s .
the second principle is that we should base decisions regarding the management of fish stocks on scientific knowledge that is as sound and accurate as possible .
I fully agree with the rapporteur when he states that it is necessary - and I would say quite urgent - that we improve the current level of protection in cases of denied boarding , flight cancellations , unjustified delays which , in many cases , lead to connections with other flights or with other means of transport being missed and a long list of similar problems , which is growing every day , not to mention the fact that we Members of this Parliament are long-suffering victims of these inconveniences .
I believe that we have now reached a sensible conclusion and would hope that the amendments adopted in committee , which address those concerns , can be supported in the plenary vote .
did you raise the issue of the Gay Pride march with Mr Putin two days before the event , when it was already known there would be problems ?
what Michel Rocard is now proposing are courses of action which are inevitable even for a country with a low rate of unemployment .
competition for competition ’ s sake should be rejected and there needs to be greater focus on quality and safety .
some of the programmes involved - Socrates , Leonardo da Vinci - are also open to all of the candidate countries .
the key step forward for Parliament which is possible now as an outcome of negotiations with the Council and the Commission , is that Parliament will be able to block the adoption of ‘ quasi-legislative ’ implementing measures to which it objects .
the 1999 budget and the research and development programme have been mentioned already .
as you mention in the report , ICT can help to significantly improve energy efficiency in other areas , such as buildings and transport in particular .
none of the obstacles mentioned can justify Parliament ’ s seat remaining in Strasbourg when all of its business is conducted in Brussels .
it is our duty to provide for this protection , but we have to do it while fully respecting not only the rights of the victims but also those of the defendants as well .
urgently reform the common agricultural policy , as there are millions of farmers in Europe too who are suffering from poverty , and convene an international conference at the first available opportunity that will take certain decisions and draw certain conclusions from this discussion and this problem .
narrow liberal thought applied as a miracle cure to the most disparate realities is another prison where policy is understood as a lay art of government and a result of the force of ideas .
this gesture gives evidence of Israel &apos;s willingness to build mutual confidence in the peace process , despite a severely critical Israeli public .
I believe that if we adopt a sensible approach , it will be the role of Parliament , the Commission and the Council to bring shipping to the forefront once again .
it would be of benefit to all concerned .
there will be no great changes to the movement of goods , because substantial liberalisation has occurred , nor in freedom of establishment , because the person or business is subject to the laws of the state in which they establish themselves .
in addition , it will not really benefit consumers , it will have very little effect in terms of harmonisation and it will not allow us to make progress with the internal market and with Europe as a business location .
the commitment in relation to European lorries has been fulfilled .
Heads of State prefer to tiptoe around the subject rather than to admit openly that in Rome three years ago they signed a document which public opinion has since rejected .
what is more , this idea of low carbon technology is simply wrong .
that said , I would like to underline three points .
Commissioner , this is an example of the protectionism that keeps rearing its ugly head , and it is unacceptable .
the European Parliament echoed these legitimate concerns and amended the directive proposed by the European Commission on the management of waste discharged by ships in such a way as to make Member States aware of their responsibilities .
in every institution , budget requests must correspond to a real need for tasks to be performed .
if humanitarian law continues to be broken , specific sanctions must be imposed .
I now have a question for Mr Haarder . Would it perhaps be possible for you to have a frank discussion with our Liberal colleagues in the Netherlands , who are your fellow party members , to ensure that this issue does not complicate matters at this time and that it is not misused in the Dutch elections ?
furthermore , you also know that the Court of Auditors already carries out inspections of its activities when they involve European Union funding .
it should not stab the democratic forces in the back .
because the voting has gone on so long , as a result of your excellent work , I would like to ask those who have requested to give explanations of vote to change these explanations from oral to written or postpone your turn until tomorrow , because 62 requests have been put forward and we are unable to deal with them all .
we now know , and it is a matter of public knowledge on which the Troika too has reported , that it proved impossible for the parties to agree on the future status of Kosovo , but all is not lost .
the other item on the agenda is the Jöns report on part-time work .
this was the context in which I dealt with the issue of competition .
some Members have argued that they should be allowed to be used for the protection of cultural heritage , for the removal of paint from old monuments without damaging .
as part of its reform process , Turkey has brought in new legislation to improve the human rights situation , to provide increased protection from torture and mistreatment , to extend freedom of expression and of the press , to reinforce the freedoms of association and of assembly , as well as the right to demonstrate , to extend cultural rights , to underpin the equality of the sexes , entrench democracy and change the relationship between the armed forces and civil society .
the political dimension could be brought back into the process .
I think it is very important because , in the end , sensitivity is also a part of our European cultural tradition .
this directive is certainly needed , because not all Member States of the European Union have in place national systems for dealing with refugees .
in other words , this structure or this body must not only be involved in debate but also in work and putting forward proposals , bringing together the different sources of the democratic legitimacy of Europe : representatives of the Members States , the European Parliament , national parliaments and the European Commission .
whoever does this study will of course firstly have to take into account an analysis of the alternatives .
in November last year , in the margins of the EU-ASEAN Summit in Singapore , the Special Envoy met the representative of the ASEAN countries . In December he also went on his first mission to China .
what we cannot do , on any account , even if we take a different approach with different countries , is apply different standards and make different demands of those countries that still have the death penalty .
I have often supported it on other occasions .
this report is not geared as much to animal welfare as I would have wished , but any improvement is something and I shall therefore wholeheartedly support it .
the Commission could also have adopted different approaches to the issue of legal protection .
for Christians and Kurds , it is , to say the least , an unpleasant place to be .
it presents no real cuts in actual levels of spending .
it is true that we are in a very influential position .
at a time when lives are being lost , companies , the national authorities and the Commission are addressing the issue in a very relaxed manner and crimes are basically going unpunished ; crimes for the sake of profits , such as the crime which France Telecom has been committing since February 2008 .
however , it is a conflict that we have managed to transform into a dialogue .
in recent weeks , the Romanian Government has given to believe that the region &apos;s destruction can be regarded as acceptable by allowing this mining activity to commence .
flexibilization , tax improvements , better training - all these things are necessary . The ideas are right .
some people argue that the numbers do not work .
Mr President , Commissioner , unfortunately I cannot really defend my report on support for networks at European level in the field of culture .
the next item is the Commission declaration on the situation in Côte d &apos;Ivoire .
an enormous responsibility has now been placed on both the British and Irish Governments to finally implement the Good Friday agreement in all its aspects , on issues such as equality , human rights , policing , demilitarisation and indeed northern representation in the Oireachtas .
Madam President , the Committee on Citizens &apos; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs is going to make a recommendation on the proposal presented to us by the Justice and Home Affairs Council with a view to ensuring public order during meetings .
we respect the decision of the Member States to enter into the European Pact for Mental Health and Well-being referred to in the report .
I would also like to confirm , here in this House , that we will offer Parliament the maximum amount of information .
but I challenge you to do what we did , go to the al-Hol camp in Syria .
satisfying though this is , it is overshadowed by the fact that , at the present time , the application of the is still in abeyance in the occupied sector of the island and that talks between the communities seem at present to have become deadlocked .
this Parliament has expressed its support for this many times .
something that you , Mr President of the European Council , will have to address is the relationship with Russia .
Mr President , I am speaking on behalf of the Dutch delegation in the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities .
the Commission would like to reassure Mr Harbour especially that it will monitor the market .
in this case , we have no alternative .
I have been privileged to participate in a number of the high-level working meetings .
the zero price reduction our committee recommends requires no compensation and there is therefore no need for degression .
we have to be very careful that we design the regime in such a way as to ensure that we do not discourage them from doing that , because we want not only consumers to go online but also businesses to put their products online , and to make the two work together , because that is what we have the opportunity to do in our dynamic e-commerce market as it moves forward from here .
thank you very much , Commissioner Nielson .
it is , in fact , the only really integrated Community policy .
there should be further analysis of the economic and ecological disaster that has not only occurred but continues to occur for the people of Galicia and other areas .
there is one thing , though , that seems to me to have received too little coverage in this debate - the need to provide more information and instruction for the citizens of the Union as to what this agreement actually means .
I would like to propose that the favourability principle be applied so that , where national rules provide better protection for consumers , these rules should be used accordingly .
the BSE and foot-and-mouth crises indicate a lack of confidence .
if the Commissioner wants to give you an explanation , I will allow him a short time to do so but , in any event , he must take into account that it is not actually on the agenda and that there are other questions which are that require his time .
to these sums can also be added the more than EUR 92 million already pledged by individual Member States .
the enormous increase in risk capital can be attributed to , among other things , the high taxation of money entering the production process .
the Commission is more than willing to expand the geographic and thematic policy content of the DCECI to preserve Parliament ’ s rights .
in addition , it plays a significant role in relation to Moldova , a country where Ukraine ’ s involvement is necessary .
what is worse than a ‘ no ’ vote is a ‘ no ’ vote that politicians do not take seriously .
for all of two years , we have been working together on the Financial Regulation , and have , most recently , been cooperating outstandingly well with the Commission in this .
as to the role of the other institutions , in the spirit of open and transparent legislation it will be important that the Parliament and the Council also include the same logic .
most of the Country-Based Support Schemes ( CBSS ) have been published and are now under evaluation by our delegations at country level , so I hope that by the summer most of the projects will start on the ground .
the conditions under which they are detained are poor and the lack of transparency in the modus operandi of the centres in question and the practices followed is unacceptable .
the Environmental Liability Directive , I recall , does not cover economic damage .
in the middle of the second paragraph of the English version there is only a reference to representation in legal proceedings , but no reference to legal consultants , as there is in the German text .
it is not an impulsive act . It is the result of a carefully planned hearing in which , Mr Barroso , we put a list of very practical questions to you which are of absolutely crucial importance to social democratic populations throughout Europe .
then , I think we have to look very carefully at the proposals before us , because we believe that the more intimately we cooperate - and more intimately than is the case today - the better , certainly , for Europe .
meanwhile , in September of last year , Parliament adopted a report on this very matter .
we are very much in favour of providing financial support for moves to restrict violence and pornography on the Internet .
( PL ) Mr President , I shall be very brief with regard to this report .
we know that this trust is undergoing a time of crisis .
I wish to point out that this deadline obtained for subsidy operations is nevertheless an achievement by the European Parliament , extending the initial deadline of 2014 as proposed by the European Commission by four years .
we talk about illegal immigration to Europe and about people who try to make their way here without valid travel documents .
thank you very much , Commissioner .
I have tried to give you an honest account of our interpretation of the situation , the problems and the three main issues that we have to be concerned about as Europeans .
I welcome also - and Parliament has always supported this - the fact that disabled people will have a stronger position .
I expect us to be guided by reason and make clear analyses .
we have only the three amendments before us that were voted in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs .
they carry out joint training and exercises and we fund such projects .
we thank the rapporteur for a thorough job on an important report .
in the long term land use planning policies shall ensure that appropriate distances between hazardous establishments and residential areas are maintained .
it should be easy to scrutinise how decisions are made , what are the influences behind them and finally , how resources &#91; ... &#93; are allocated &apos; .
a very simple tax would suffice .
if it is agreed as drafted , they will be pursued through the Court of Justice for years by the Commission .
henceforth , there should be no difference of opinion on the point of substance between your Parliament and the Commission &apos;s attitude .
this morning , we discussed the proposal to tackle illegal employment in the absence of the Council .
any time you create something new , there will be resistance .
it is still not meeting its own objectives and the confusion and disruption are putting the EU at a competitive disadvantage .
only basic education and social protection would remain in the public sector .
this is certainly a quite regrettable incident .
it should be added that the National Socialist Party , with Chancellor Hitler at its head , ruled over Germany at the time , having come to power on the basis of a democratic decision by the German electorate .
last year , I was there to take a course in Spanish .
on this score , the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Security and Defence Policy of the European Parliament supported the work carried out by the Truth and Reconciliation Committee and the setting up of the National Cooperation for Reparations and Reconciliation , and it is also very important that affairs such as the already mentioned Soria case and that of the Clarín newspaper be solved , and in particular that we should put an end to all of the impediments which are standing in the way of Chilean democracy today .
it is true that this year , for example , we have contributed EUR 35 million to the UNRWA &apos;s EUR 170 million education budget .
good luck to all of us with the Azeris and the Turkmenis in the market .
against this background , I would like to thank everyone involved for their hard work .
I should like , if I may , to make one further remark , because some speeches did not directly relate solely to the subject of this directive , but to health and safety at work in general .
we must remember that we share this world not just with people today , but with those who come in the future .
Mr President , we were able to have a thorough debate yesterday on the proposal on which Parliament has now voted .
what we urgently need now in the European Union is additional investment in product development and marketing , so that European companies can acquire a clear leading position in the global market for environmental technology .
in short , sovereignty in our system does not lie with the people but with political parties , whose supremacy is to be consolidated , bolstered and inflated by these prehistoric plans that you are presenting to us .
the European Parliament has lent its support to these policies .
however , this is not the case with the European Union at this juncture given that BSE has severely shaken consumer confidence .
we need a common , coherent and up-to-date European security policy which will help strengthen our European identity and allow the EU to speak with a single , credible voice in the international arena .
Parliament has broadly approved the Commission &apos;s proposals , with a few recommendations intended to make the system more interoperable .
the travel document which I used was the pass issued to all MEPs by the European Parliament .
China has unique knowledge and experience in this field , which could be of great help .
it is from this ongoing dialogue between the European Council and the convention , or conference or assembly or forum , whatever we choose to call it ( let us not get into the dangerous territory of terminology ) that the right questions would be able to emerge . Finally , all the institutional implications could be drawn from it .
we will not , however , achieve this through bombs and blood .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I look forward to the new British Presidency which has a positive attitude towards further developments in the Union .
the second proposal on the table today is the proposed directive on consumer credit .
furthermore , the report raises fresh questions . Will we actually be able to ensure that the framework directive will have sufficient substance to uphold the aforementioned principles ?
our colleagues in the national parliaments will relate and react differently to EU legislative work done at Council level if they can directly follow what our governments , the governments of every Member State , are discussing and the positions that they are adopting within the Council .
most of Africa is affected by similar tragedies , including the tragedy affecting the Sahrawi people , with which we came face to face this morning just outside here .
so this is an area where we could afford to be a little generous .
( DE ) Madam President , I am always pleased when new members join the European Union , which is why I also voted in favour of this motion .
to be successful we need a broad consensus .
what we are requesting , then , is a general debate . Its starting point would be the situation in Italy , but please let me stress categorically that I do not want it to focus on Italy alone .
despite the extraordinary efforts of the Italian Government , local administrations and the Italian Red Cross , the situation on the island is one of emergency : there is no sign that the arrivals will slow to a halt and one notes the delay of the EU , which has bureaucratic timescales that are incompatible with the situation .
personally , I strongly support the Commission &apos;s proposals to include third-country nationals in the regulation and to do so on the legal base it has proposed .
this link is shown in the documents supplied by the French Authorities , but it is high time they told us clearly whether or not they believe that this waterway - which has been delayed for nearly a quarter of a century - is still profitable today , and whether its completion is compatible with environmental protection .
the Commission is grateful for your support on many key points .
we therefore need to apply the know-how of microfinancing institutions such as the Grameen Bank and others that are already implementing projects for the poorest of the poor , such as solar collectors or PV systems .
I do not doubt that Slovakia and its government – in particular its government – have to respect these fundamental rights .
the Committee on Budgets proposes ECU 150 million to fight unemployment .
Europe is weak : it has no common foreign policy and no military capacity .
I very much agree with Mr De Luca that it is important when developing our policy on China to be realistic and to be pragmatic .
Madam President , there is not going to be a flood of immigrants from one country to another .
I do not want any money from the European Union &apos; .
we will be celebrating in December , and I hope that what will come afterwards will not be a hangover but the positive memory of the celebration itself and the reasons for it .
I have the feeling , however , that , when we get down to the details of the regulation , some of the principles that we have upheld so strongly dissolve away inexplicably .
which languages are most spoken ?
the fact that , for example , the French President has made a proposal to draft a European constitution enshrining the division of responsibilities is a major step forward , because dividing up responsibilities would create the confidence necessary for more majority voting in the Council , which is one of the most important preconditions for its ability to act .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , two days ago , North Korea crossed a red line .
however , Mrs Harms , this means that we need to try to find a proper balance in each subject area , for on the issue of climate change , for example , the action we take must not produce any undesired effects which could have social consequences .
but we in our group have often asked ourselves : what would have happened if our political friends had had your political responsibility ?
altogether , the new employment chapter in the Treaty , the resolution on employment and growth , and the establishment of a genuine social policy at European level ought to form a useful complement to EMU .
but on the other hand , virtually no financial provision has been made for emergency aid .
Mr President , the Russian government will be tempted to draw parallels between our action against Serbia to end the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and their action against Chechen crime .
the consequences are the same , regardless of the size of the works concerned .
obviously not .
is it to remove weapons or to remove Saddam Hussein ?
on the contrary , the few agreements that have been reached are hedged about with compromises and will in all likelihood not be properly effective .
Mr President , how much longer will the governments of any political hue in Europe carrying on treating pensioners like pieces of paper or dead branches and not as people who breathe , live , have worked and therefore have earned everyone ’ s respect ?
10 . Public access to documents 2009-2010 (
secondly , we believe the agreement reached in Cyprus must be supported . In our view , it is very important for the future of the Union .
the health of consumers is , of course , one of them , but there is also the position of producers here if we are not able to ensure that what may not be used here , may not be used outside the EU either .
several NGOs which lead the fight in this field , such as the Coalition Against the Death Penalty , asked us not to be too hasty in submitting the resolution but to wait long enough to guarantee its success .
there is a need to increase the role of industry , in particular , that of small and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) , so contributing to reinforcing Europe &apos;s position of leadership in a globalised world .
today , the European Parliament adopted the resolution on the European integration process of Montenegro .
we have tabled amendments that we think are sensible .
having said that , we also know very clearly , and this was apparent from the second meeting we had , the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee meeting , that we cannot only have political negotiations .
this is a basic element of the decision .
the third point is the multiplicity of different cards .
you occasionally have to endure criticism from this House , too .
at the very least , therefore , this Parliament should pause for thought and refer this legislation back to a committee for a full evaluation of its costs and consequences .
the Commission will continue to play an active role in the further development of SOLVIT .
 
personal data can be misused to exclude newcomers from the market and the point is that in a healthily competitive situation the consumer can insist on privacy , companies can be disciplined by consumers , as happened with Facebook , for example .
violence against women is a reality all too often overlooked : it is thought that between 20 and 25 % of European women will have already been subjected to physical violence at least once in their adult life .
the Chairman of the Convention , Valéry Giscard d &apos;Estaing , is making the surprising proposal that the universally accepted name of the European Union be changed , e.g. to United Europe or United States of Europe .
there is firstly the admission that the Lisbon Strategy objectives will not be achieved in 2010 .
this has a direct effect on our citizens and businesses .
Mr Schüssel , I wish you luck .
border police need to be aware of the existence and function of this document .
hence my request to the Commission : we want to continue working with you on a basis of trust .
there has been a 2002 directive and a 2005 Court of Justice ruling and , now , there is the desire to reconcile the market and profit - which is referred to as intellectual property - with consumer safety .
for it is , in particular , those nations that lay under Soviet occupation who have paid the real price of the Second World War .
but I am also against the Constitution .
none of us want to see any more death or grief in any region of the European Union , in particular there where the situation has been so tragic for so long .
the Five Wise Men &apos;s Report focuses on the concept of responsibility .
which is why the Commission cannot , unfortunately , agree to the proposed amendments to the regulation on financial support for observers .
many homeless people have access to temporary accommodation in mobile homes .
( SV ) The undersigned have voted against the report .
other areas such as air , sea and river transport will benefit enormously from the emergence of this European technology .
the main motivation of these migrants is purely economic .
this aggression is not being handled properly in Hungary and it must be condemned .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , today we are dealing with the Commission proposal to support the Eurostars Joint Programme , and I thank you for giving me a few minutes to explain the key features and the importance of this initiative .
and this is a very real threat to our democracies .
where does the Eurofighter stand ?
I myself have had the opportunity of visiting Iraq a number of times while Saddam Hussein has been in power and in comparison with most other dictatorships I have visited Iraq is still a special case .
in particular , they deal with the use of ITS for the safety of users , as for example in the case of intelligent signs for the visually impaired .
it therefore accepts the amendments corresponding to conclusions 8 , 10 , 11 and 12 of the opinion drawn up by the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights .
everyone , men and women alike , at the same time had the right to vote and the right to stand for election .
on Amendments Nos 46 and 47 on the financial proposal , I am not able to commit the Commission formally tonight because the broader discussions on allocations have not yet been concluded .
this is the third consecutive time that the Court of Auditors has refused to give overall positive assurances with regard to the legality and regularity of the underlying payment operations . However , at the time of its 1995 investiture , the European Commission announced rigorous action to improve financial management , particularly within its own services .
to do that , in Europe we need to identify the safety concerns , collect data for a health and environmental impact assessment of the product , and act at the earliest possible stage through adjustments , where necessary , of risk assessment procedures for nanotechnology .
. Madam President , Commissioner , there is no doubting the fact that this Galileo project is of the utmost strategic importance and , as a public-private partnership of such great dimensions , unique in the EU .
I have even more concern about and difficulty with proposals to use reserves to intervene in the market for purposes of price-smoothing , when experience shows - and recent experience in the United States in particular shows - that it does not work .
as I have already said , any approach needs to balance two factors : the need for the transplantation of organs - which is usually a matter of life or death - and the need to ensure high standards of quality and safety of such organs .
if any government minister anywhere in the EU were to condemn those arrests this morning or later to resist connected necessary extraditions , we would all be outraged because terrorism is terrorism and is not sanitised by the passage of time .
Mr President , Commissioner , I thank you for your full reply .
these include , for example , the concentration of the cross-compliance requirements on the most important provisions with the aim of improving administrative manageability , a moderate increase in the portion of cross-compliance moneys remaining in the Member States , a longer preparation time for the installation of the management advisory system with initial voluntary participation which shall only later be made obligatory , greater flexibility for the Member States with regard to the payment of advances relating to direct payments , flexible treatment of cases of hardship and problems in calculating and allocating the uniform management premium as well as the option for the Member States to exclude certain types of fruit from the areas subject to premiums , the retention of the rotating set-aside land with the possibility of secondary growth of commodities in these areas , delaying the decoupling of milk premiums in the interest of simplifying administration or a more flexible cofinancing rate for agricultural environmental measures and an occasional increase in the promotion sums in areas with specific environmental restrictions .
the second relates to the target of full employment – 70 % of people in work in Europe – taking account of the fact that some countries in northern Europe , like the United States , have already exceeded that threshold : there is no doubt that the presence of women in the job market is not only what women want but also what our entire Community needs .
first of all , on behalf of the Chairman of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz , I should like formally to move the oral question , the subject of which is the EU strategic objectives for the 13th meeting of the CITES Convention .
we receive regular updates from Kosovo , and I also meet with the responsible ministers , and once all these elements are in place , we are ready to launch a new mission to go there and see what steps can be taken in order to open the visa liberalisation dialogue .
this is not a failure of the presidency ; it may well be a failure of the Council , but one needs to distinguish between these things .
furthermore , by unanimously adopting the two amendments I have proposed concerning lines B2-910 and B2-901 and 902 , the Committee on Fisheries has shown a particular interest in two essential aspects of the CFP , in this case , priority to traditional fishing and the essential means anticipated to put a fair monitoring system in place .
what is more , these reports are not even transparent , as we do not know how the Governors voted in the ECB Governing Council .
things have to improve , we need better information and more streamlined legislation , but I think that the introduction of higher standards at this moment in time , given the proceedings that are still pending , is taking matters too far .
I was the rapporteur for the ERTMS .
I believe we will therefore have a volume of information never previously achieved .
who has not witnessed the sale and purchase of sportsmen , some of whom are still very young ?
the regulations are clear .
if the European Union is exporting and wishes to export its basic democratic values associated with the protection of human rights and the values of good governance , it must itself become the best example of these values .
you , the European Parliament , have started with a study , the hearing of last November and this own-initiative report we are discussing today .
as you said yourself , the decision has not yet been taken .
I quite simply do not see us actually thinking through what we mean by modern trade policy .
this is a subject that closely concerns us , as Members of the European Parliament , and I would like to open up the debate on this .
I am not sure that Austrian farmers would like that to happen .
some of them were next to impossible only a few years ago .
Africa has suffered enough under colonialism and slavery and from the exploitation of its natural resources .
Mr President , I should like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Schröder , and everyone who has taken part in what I feel has been a high-quality debate .
this is known as gender budgeting , or budgeting according to sex , which is intended to respond to two questions .
the key points are that the unanimity requirement stands in the way of efficient and rapid action in this field .
this is why it is worth stressing that draft laws of a country should comply with defined standards and be in accordance with European Union law , which guarantees equal treatment for specified minorities , including ethnic minorities .
further measures are planned as part of the 10th European Development Fund , for which EUR 311 million are estimated from 2008 to 2013 .
he who walks out of negotiations , loses .
as a European and a Dutchman I am sad to see that the Council presidency is again absent as it was during the BSE debate .
there are indeed urgent measures that the Member States need to take in these areas .
in this connection , I should also like to thank my colleague , Mr Rasmussen , who has done some constructive work in drafting the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs so that the report also focuses on the EU ’ s external policies .
as a technical , autonomous and independent body , recommendations regarding this subject should come from the IAEA with the proper support from the EU , and not the other way round .
it can be stated that the EIB has been increasing the volume of loans with favourable interest terms continuously since 2008 , and pledged to make available an additional annual amount of EUR 15 billion in extra funds for small and medium-sized enterprises in 2009 and 2010 .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission welcomes Parliament &apos;s initiative in presenting a resolution on the human rights situation in Tibet .
we must constantly evaluate whether an agency provides any added value .
it is fortunate that we have had a programme of this sort within the European Union for a number of years , and it has achieved noteworthy successes .
this step smacks of reactionary neoliberalism , and I hope that the final vote will preserve the spirit of this report and be a credit to this Parliament .
therefore , in the presence of public support and a favourable political situation , I encourage the Commission to show even more initiative , use all mechanisms to influence behaviour so as to ensure that the ambitious 20 per cent goals are met and that the benefits of energy efficiency can be felt by every European .
this does not in any way mean that the Council has no concern for disabled people .
the institutions keep the role of triggering the mechanism .
I think that this new revision procedure could contribute towards linking the European Parliament more closely with the revision of the Treaties .
certain protected species have begun to recover .
however , a great deal needs to be done and the Treaty of Lisbon has improved our efficacy in this sector .
the figures and the levels of hake stocks have been questioned and we should be guided by evidence .
the answer is that some governments just do not want to introduce these measures .
the European Union &apos;s relations with China are of strategic importance to all Members of the European Parliament and they do and will have major global repercussions .
these are the reasons why Parliament is retabling the amendments we previously tabled .
proposals have also been announced to improve the transparency and supervision of products derived from agricultural commodities .
the European Parliament has played a particularly active part in the drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and has brought decisive influence to bear on the substance of the text .
many women and families are asking whether European politicians have a practical solution and concrete policies for social problems .
the same applies for international negotiations , as their conclusion depends on third parties .
( Parliament gave its assent )
but we do not share the US President &apos;s view that war against Iraq is justified at this stage .
there is , in other words , a large degree of freedom for the Member States .
their hypocrisy does nothing to improve Parliament &apos;s image and does even less to improve the image of the majority of the Bureau which , through its decision of 19 October that is hypocritical and lacks transparency , has established a true self-service system for the money provided by the taxpayer .
the European Union has paid EUR 15 million into the fund for the period 2007-2010 .
finally , have these programmes allowed for the current tendency towards a reduction in the consumption of natural gas , evident in many Member States of the European Union ?
wide-ranging duty exemptions must therefore be linked to an absolute obligation to respect human rights .
the conditions for a dialogue are better than they were in the past , now that Turkey has been informed from various quarters that there is a prospect of it becoming a full member of the European Union if it satisfies all the conditions laid down in Copenhagen for all applicants to EU membership .
that is why it is important to get comments from other Member States .
this is a disease that can turn a person &apos;s life upside-down .
this report deals with taxation and development in developing countries .
it is more ambitious ; it may not be ambitious enough , but it is more so than the Member States , or at least than a number of Member States are prepared to be .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the question about the state of the shipbuilding industry in the Community is prompted by deep concern about the future of this sector .
there is a mistake in our list of votes , which we are keen to put right .
I believe that the Israeli Prime Minister &apos;s insistence that he wants to decide who to negotiate with is completely unacceptable : everybody has to represent themselves .
it is a mark of a civilised society how it treats its animals .
as Mrs Randzio-Plath said , there are less than 90 days left before the euro is introduced and , in these times of economic and financial upheaval , it has been shown that the euro will provide extremely important security and stability for the euro area .
we have , I believe , made quite some headway .
 
I was interested to hear Commissioner Špidla say that there are no indications that the agreements have been breached .
I should just like to say something here to our colleague from London : having heard your speech , I must ask you a question in return .
it is not an omission on its part if this list does not include businesses , which are in fact the first to be concerned , since it proposes to increase their subsidies . It is quite simply that the report seems to think that this goes without saying .
I therefore entirely agree with the rapporteur &apos;s priority statement that the sums earmarked for the common agricultural policy and the cohesion policy in the next period must not be lower than in the current framework .
I would like , however , to mention one other very important aspect of this disease : the families of patients who are losing the fight against cancer .
it covers such things as aircraft , ships and buildings .
after Lisbon and on the verge of our accession to the Convention on Human Rights , this is only to be expected .
it formerly consisted of cooperation under Eurocontrol , but under Eurocontrol alone .
let us not forget that , as we know , the reports on the European Parliament in the media do not always reflect the decisions taken in it .
a number of issues need to be addressed without delay , in particular , the reopening of all crossings into and out of Gaza , a sustained halt to rocket attacks against Israel and an effective means to prevent arms-smuggling to Gaza .
I share many of your views , but my obligation is to obey the Rules of Procedure and the timetable .
nonetheless , Parliament must have full and free access to all documents .
nonetheless , the total abolition of the death penalty for criminals , terrorists and bloodthirsty dictators in the most unstable and violent parts of the world is an irresponsible , nonsensical and harmful proposal .
they should not allow it and should really pay no more attention to the sectoral councils than they do to political proposals made by the legal services .
hence my support for the sound report by Mr Swoboda ; we have come to expect nothing less of him , and hence also my words of appreciation for the respected Republic of Macedonia .
as far as safety on aircraft and at boarding are concerned , the events of 11 September show that two measures must be taken in aircraft design : cockpits must be sealed off and video monitors must be installed to enable the pilot to see anyone nearing the cockpit .
I take the view that it is precisely the moves towards industrialisation that have taken place in these countries that have created the conditions for this pandemic , for they have brought indigenous and adapted breeds into contact with genetically developed breeds that may have adapted to industrialisation but have genetic defects and lack resistance to this disease .
in the light of the disaster in Japan , we need to do everything possible to speed up the introduction of renewable energy sources .
Mr President , it might have been lost in translation that what Mr Schulz was asking for was that the Council Presidency , in its Wednesday statement , should take a view on this issue and make it perfectly clear where the Council stands on it .
nevertheless , Madam President , I did not understand your speech .
according to the Commission &apos;s announcement in July , it had taken a decision on the complaint , on the authorization of Commissioner Monti .
I noted Minister Haarder &apos;s remarks when he said that he could not promise any changes here today .
life-long learning , communication between the generations , voluntary work and similar issues on which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has done a lot of work are intrinsically related to this discussion .
Commissioner , the European Commission needs to study in detail the points made in this motion and develop the recommendations made therein by introducing practical measures .
in this sense we have a lot to learn from the Scandinavian countries . They have proved that one of the most effective means of poverty reduction is an active labour market policy combined with the establishment of decent working conditions and strong social protection .
the same also applies to another project we have proposed , namely the social integration of migrants .
I believe we have two possible fundamental points of departure , which you have mentioned : on the one hand , the development of European citizenship and , on the other , the introduction of the euro .
tobacco production is not sustainable in all areas , but I think that , with the earmarked rural development money for the tobacco sector , it can also mean that those that want to maintain or to stay in business can modernise their tobacco production and maybe at the end of the day have a tobacco production that can be economically viable , because the quality of the tobacco will increase .
that had been at risk on account of Parliament &apos;s putting very detailed requirements on the table .
he stopped me and said , &apos; Listen , Carlo , you who are now a Member of the European Parliament , ask Parliament - when you debate the Avilés Perea report , which concerns the Committee of the Regions , amongst other things - to give the regions more importance , to give them legislative power , even if it is only partial legislative power , and to allow the elected representatives of the regions throughout Europe to sit in the European Parliament too &apos; .
I am pleased to have the opportunity to join you for this debate .
furthermore , we must stand firm against the incitements to hate expressed by Polish leaders against homosexuals .
I wish to commend the fact that Parliament has spoken with one voice in condemning the use of violence , in paying tribute to the victims of terrorism , and in calling for a complete return to peace .
it is worth noting that , unlike competing global positioning systems – notably American ones – our Galileo project has been used exclusively for civilian purposes .
indeed , the anti-governmental action against the government instigated by the part of the opposition known as the Democratic Coordinator lies completely outside the framework of the Venezuelan Constitution and , moreover , only served the economic and commercial interests of forces outside Venezuela which had no hesitation in reducing the entire country to poverty in order to continue to enjoy privileges and pursue specific goals .
a second area referred to by the rapporteur on which I would like to offer some brief comments is that of cancer .
we are facing a great challenge , which is to see the countries of central and eastern Europe with full democracy , which will enable fast , smooth enlargement .
the debate is closed .
for the Banking Authority , the proposed executive director is Adam Farkas ; for the Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority it is Carlos Montalvo , and for the Markets Authority it is Verena Ross .
the African Union ’ s and NEPAD ’ s vision of good governance , democracy and respect for human rights deserves the European Union ’ s support .
another reason for Parliament ’ s call for a legal act under codecision which would include the principles of funding is to clarify the Treaties and case-law .
this is in charge of the regional Balkans operation .
the Chair of the African Union , Mr Obiang Nguema , denounced it in no uncertain terms yesterday .
despite the fact that this issue has been discussed for years now , no agreement has been reached with Canada and the United States so the Commission &apos;s proposal to remit this again cannot be accepted .
moreover , there is the Lisbon Treaty that will bestow new and important powers as well as grant a much greater role to this Parliament in this area .
this is literally the chronicle of a death foretold .
secondly , we had noted that the European Union , despite adverse conditions worldwide , is one of the world ’ s biggest producers and investors , and that it does indeed , of course , have opportunities to carry on exercising a great deal of economic clout in globalised markets , but we did also point out that – particularly when doing business with third countries – we need to consider whether those countries comply with international standards in labour law , social security law and the environment , and we proposed that preferential trade arrangements should be extended or adapted in such a way that certain preferences would be accorded to those third countries that do so – that is , to those that have ratified the international agreements on the protection of workers and of the environment and have duly implemented them .
the second thing is that there is no mention of the fact that 2 October will be one of the most significant days in the entire history of the EU , and this will be during the term of the Swedish Presidency .
sixteen would own a telephone .
when Mr Aznar presented the programme for the Spanish Presidency , I regretted the lack of any clear commitment to continue dialogue towards the objective of concluding a partnership agreement between the EU and Cuba , if at all possible before this year is out .
chapters 23 and 15 are among those being frozen unilaterally .
in this context , also , Mr Erdoğan &apos;s appearances in Germany , where he called on the Turks in Germany to un-integrate , must be viewed in a critical light .
the social dimensions of globalisation constitute the subject matter of this report .
I must stress that it is the duty of both the European Parliament and the Committee to resolve this problem .
we have noted in the past that a portion of these funds was not used , or was used badly .
this directive is not , in effect , a draft measure to regulate biotechnology - its objective is much more restricted and , as stated , an attempt is being made to protect biotechnological inventions , nothing more , nothing less .
we accordingly need to be ambitious in identifying specific responses to the problems which lie behind terrorism and fundamentalism .
it too needs a strong statement of policy in Florence .
in addition , European and national politicians must clarify to their respective peoples the efforts that have previously been made by the candidate countries .
Mr Hughes asked , on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament , whether it was the dreams of the founding fathers that were holding Europe together at present or the nightmare of its collapse .
let me conclude with two further brief comments .
this is something we can do only within the framework of this dialogue , which goes above and beyond the NATO dialogue .
but , despite all of this , there are many other manifestations of the Basque uniqueness , not only in social , biological , civic , legal or administrative terms , but also , and above all , economically and fiscally .
you will recall that in Gothenburg the Swedish Presidency tried to reach an agreement over headquarters ; that in Laeken , the Belgian Presidency tried once again , and put forward a proposed agreement on headquarters , which was blocked by not only one , but by various countries at the same time .
we know that our railway package , too , will have to go to conciliation .
but what happens to concrete measures , the moment the industrial lobbies get to work on the decision-making of the EU &apos;s highest authorities ?
we already have a Green Paper about it which barely mentions the need for research in other areas , such as fisheries .
we can accompany it down that road , or ought it to be said that the Commission is following where Parliament leads ?
facilitating the movement of citizens between the various countries should not be used as a means of facilitating the exploitation of cheap temporary labour that is easily &apos; discarded &apos; , undermining labour relations , and in particular fuelling a retrograde step in terms of workers &apos; rights and social conditions .
Mr President , the Ombudsman , Jacob Söderman , said in this debate this morning that citizenship is perhaps less fashionable than the technocratic way of doing things , and in this he might be right .
 
this in turn results in an increase in Member State contributions , and therefore in the taxation of citizens , of the taxpayers in the Member States .
it is estimated that the total cost of domestic violence within the 27 Member States could be as high as EUR 16 billion .
.
we are working with eight other countries in the Maritime Organisation Analysis Centre to combat cocaine trafficking .
why ?
today , already , the Union is concentrating a key economic and industrial force in Europe and the world .
– Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , competition will of course be distorted if , for example , there is access to the electricity market but not to the gas market .
this policy , whose only guiding principle is the maximisation of profitability for the European monopolies , through the accumulation of vast wealth on the basis of savage exploitation of the working class , is spreading poverty , inequality and marginalisation , and is drastically eroding the position of the working-class family and aggravating working-class problems .
I am pleased to note that the Commission has taken serious steps in this respect .
ladies and gentlemen , as Mrs André-Léonard was saying , our debates have been short , though that does not mean that the quality or importance of the issues covered have been in any way compromised .
the European Parliament will probably approve this package and I believe it to be a good one , but we cannot rest on our laurels because without genuine Community regulation , without genuine certification of quality which puts the minds of citizens throughout the European Union at rest , we will not make great progress in constructing the market for European products .
in this sense I think that we must support the Cunha report and oppose the Commission proposals for the enlargement 2000 programme .
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting : see Minutes
the importance of world cultural heritage sites transcends the scope of regional development .
the next item is the joint debate on the report ( A5-0171 / 2003 ) by Mr Lisi , on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries , on a Community Action Plan for the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources in the Mediterranean Sea under the Common Fisheries Policy &#91; COM ( 2002 ) 535 - C5-0623 / 2002 - 2002 / 2281 ( INI ) &#93; .
organizations that hold a dominant market position will have to offer new market operators access and connection under transparent , reasonable and non-discriminatory conditions .
secondly , guaranteeing that the interests of the current least favoured regions and countries are not touched and that a fair method will be found so that they continue to benefit from the level of support they receive today ;
it will also include relevant information on the prevention measures taken by the Member States in order to make a suitable assessment of how the legislation is working in practice .
the common theme to which I would like to dedicate this presidency is a political commitment - through policy leadership , through stressing our public purpose , through insisting on the added value we bring on a continental scale - that we are building the democratic part of Europe &apos;s future and that we are the check and the balance and the counterweight and the source of accountability for the European technocracy .
we should be building offshore reefs .
when we discuss what to do , we must ask whether the basis on which we grant aid is the right one .
the report , however , is also a compendium and a condemnation of incoherences and irresponsibilities .
let me turn now - very briefly - to fisheries and to the report by Mrs Langenhagen , Mr Mulder and Mr Färm , the motion for a resolution in which I can very largely endorse , so that I would now like simply to pick up on only a few of its aspects .
nevertheless , I would like to remind you that the notion of temporary cabotage , which is now in force , leaves serious legal uncertainties .
and it is very cynical to portray the European financing of European election campaigns and all manner of European political foundations as a strengthening of European democracy .
of course , the great attention of the budgetary authority on the problems we have had has increased the Commission &apos;s awareness of the issue .
( RO ) Bearing in mind that neuro-degenerative diseases affect a huge number of people and , unfortunately , some countries have inadequate facilities for diagnosing and treating these diseases , I would like to ask you whether you are in favour of setting up European treatment centres which , based on a growing number of patients , may encourage research in the field in order to discover solutions for preventing and treating these diseases .
so let me say quite bluntly that , as you have already mentioned , we called for a framework directive .
it is certain that the resistance of the Iraqi people against the conquerors , under any guise , will continue with increasing international solidarity .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen .
I am therefore emphatically opposed to that idea .
I happen to know that there are a few that have objected to this .
for the 2011 budget , additional expenditure is required above and beyond the ceilings of headings 1a and 4 .
 
at its worst , we want to avoid the possibility that the aims of the structural funds and the European Union &apos;s concern to protect its natural habitats may collide .
there is no doubt that we need a qualified majority in the final vote if we are to call on the Commission to take legislative action , but I fail to see why we also need a qualified majority beforehand for amendments .
our condemnation of terrorism must be global and there should be no exception .
I would also say to some of the participating MEPs here that there are forces in Sweden which believe that the law concerning personal data should be repealed .
the analysis of road accidents is decisive .
it is then up to us , with the kind help of a number of MEPs , to see how , by means of derogation requests , we can undo the nitrate legislation , for example , in order to reach the goal , this being a reduction in nitrate levels , in a decent fashion .
so schools in Europe should be declared drug-free zones on a voluntary basis .
we do not want to live in a Europe in which the crisis is met with budgetary discipline and with confrontation .
it is not enough to do a lot but it is necessary to do enough .
President-in-Office of the Council , I would therefore like once again to highlight the issues that concern us : we cannot fight crime on our own .
these three scientific committees then considered the matter and set up a meeting at which they also called on experts from the USA , amongst others , for the precise purpose of seeking assurances , not least in connection with ampicillin .
on behalf of the PPE Group . - Mr President , thank you for your kind words of solidarity .
we know , for example , my area is supposedly the beneficiary of Ericsson &apos;s decision .
although the European Commission cannot demand that an individual or a company implement the provisions of the directive on misleading and comparative advertising , as Guardian of the Treaties , it must ensure that the directive is properly implemented in the Member States .
the Europe that the Commission is building is not the Europe that its citizens want .
Mr President , there is of course one matter we keep coming back to . It is the same alliance every time , and that does not improve matters .
such networks , which facilitate the flow of information and can provide support , if needed , are a feature of businesses run by men , whereas women are more vulnerable from this point of view .
I would not , and I am sure no other colleague would either .
the global appropriations for payments amount to EUR 96 992 million , which constitutes an increase of 1.4 % on the 2002 figure .
Mr President , it has taken longer to get the Energy Charter completed than its inventor , former Dutch prime minister Lubbers , ever imagined in 1990 , largely because of a growing self-awareness on the part of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe .
our group is determined to continue to work towards a solution to both these problems .
the Commission also agrees that the fixing of the air quality values , on which the economically efficient proposals on fuel quality are based , must take account of the need to protect health and the environment .
this debate is one that we are pushing quite vigorously with our development partners .
my question to the Commissioner - she may not be able to answer now but could perhaps write to us to let us know exactly what her position is - is as follows : is it true , therefore , that there is absolutely nothing flowing from this legislation to prevent charities from our countries exporting quite freely , with no bureaucracy about it , used clothing to those countries - predominantly , I suspect , in Africa - which import them at the moment ?
it would just be too convenient for those who continue to count on world indifference to go on oppressing the Chinese and the Tibetans .
the Commission must inform the complainant immediately and consistently .
if what we are doing today and tomorrow is a small step towards this , because it will become clearer which countries have good services and which have poor services , which are doing something for their citizens and which are not , then we will have achieved a great deal .
all this is compounded by concern over the fact that BP has announced an agreement with Libya for offshore extraction just under 500 km south of Sicily .
that is why several of them have asked to be allowed to combat fraudulent mechanisms using a reverse charge mechanism targeted at certain sectors susceptible to fraud and certain goods .
therefore , in 1993 the Commission adopted a recommendation on the tax treatment of residents &apos; income .
the role of the European Training Foundation will therefore be essential .
there were many researchers out there who were anxious about future funding and the prospect of funding being cut off .
it is , however , clear that in a European market such as this , where more players are entering the arena , there must be proper safety arrangements .
it is objectionable that the Council and the Commission should try to legislate in this way , not least in view of the fact that as recently as December 1996 , the Council presidency agreed that in future all declarations would be sent to Parliament with the common position .
the crisis may also be a new opportunity .
fourthly , the European Parliament should emphasise to the Member States the urgent importance of increasing opportunities for disabled people and immigrants to have access to the labour market in the service sector .
Israel does not want to make this distinction , but the European Union does .
so far , we have had neither the political mechanisms nor the instruments to prevent or settle conflicts .
this will basically depend upon imposing common stress criteria to banks , which are interpreted and applied uniformly and broadly , so as to cover the various risks to each national market .
in January 1996 , by means of a letter from two officials , it advised the Member States not to apply the legislation in force .
all those opposed to racism in Europe must unite together against this new wave of hatred and intolerance .
it is not for this Parliament to make a list of charges and to restrict ourselves to a discussion of what is at fault .
we must make sure that area of research forms part of the programme .
after all , we are paying 57 % of the budget ; the Member States 22 % , and this is completely disproportionate to our right to have a say .
the good people of Greece now find themselves stuck between a rock and a hard place as it becomes very clear that you are running the show in that country and not their elected government .
it is very unfortunate that the manufacturers of equipment now want to make this successful and clear system of labelling an unclear category , and that the Commission is inclined to support this .
despite this , I abstained from the final vote because I think that this report interferes in the affairs of nation states in many points .
I should therefore like to repeat that it was not Mr Kovács who was the hero , but the Polish workers in Lublin , in Świdnik , and then in Gdansk in 1981 .
Mr Barroso should be capable of providing the political leadership of a President of the European Commission who helped to draw up the Constitution and is in favour of it .
the report further highlights several cases of incorrect transposition of the Directive into Member States &apos; national legislation and cases of incorrect practical application .
Mr President , I would like to say much more , but I know that that is not possible .
firstly , Turkey is not a European country , but forms part of Asia Minor .
Mr President , Europe has a problem and that problem cannot simply be solved by working on presentation or by explaining more effectively how good Europe really is .
( FI ) Mr President , a challenging year lies ahead : there are the elections and economic crisis on top of everything .
it is not , however , of crucial importance to the big global players or in terms of shareholder value , and on that point I would refer back to what was said by President Barroso and by Mr Watson .
first of all , it is still only an idea that we are studying .
there were many dead and injured as a result of the first Chechen conflict , numbers being totally comparable with the dead and injured witnessed in other conflicts world-wide , as well as in Europe .
a total of 100 million people live by its shoreline , and then there is Russia , which is important .
I shall speak to him privately about that .
we regret the rejection of the amendments that we tabled , in which we registered our deeply held belief that a State with sound social protection based on high environmental , social and labour standards and characterised by progressive taxation and the redistribution of the income and wealth generated is conducive to good economic performance .
we believe that reforms need to have grass-roots support in each country .
when our children ask us what purpose Europe serves , we will be able to proudly reply : ‘ Look at what we are doing in the Middle East ’ .
I share the rapporteur &apos;s approach in linking working time to safety .
these countries need to know when they are moving closer to the European Union , when stagnation is setting in , and when , indeed , their progress is being set back .
for that reason , I was against this report .
Mr Diamandouros , the year 2009 marked the 15th anniversary of the institution of the European Ombudsman .
the draftsman of the opinion would have liked to have seen more weight accorded to this in the draft report , because this draft report calls for active support which goes beyond compensation .
such references are quite simply incorrect and deeply offensive to the Polish nation .
I welcome the recent statement of the Regional Affairs Commissioner , Mrs Wulf-Mathies , when she stated that adequate funds must remain for continuing special support to the present four cohesion countries , namely Spain , Portugal , Greece and my own country of Ireland during the next structural funds round .
we are talking about a common security and foreign policy .
will you chase up the other 23 Member States ?
we ought to examine this IFRS process , in particular , in relation to whether all is well with it at the moment : the Commission presents the European Parliament with a standard at short notice , the Commission and industry are expected to implement it relatively quickly , pressure from industry gets stronger and stronger , and those who have the duty of justifying it to citizens on the ground are not given any opportunity to form an opinion on it .
furthermore , we think that the decision is far too weak when it comes to the agricultural and structural funds .
since aid applications are made by the farmer , defined as a person whose holding is situated within Community territory and who exercises an agricultural activity , the Commission does not receive data concerning land ownership or the aristocratic status of the beneficiary .
it cannot create jobs by legislating to cut working hours , as if jobs were a cake that you carve up and divide between people .
in Wicklow , in my own area of Cromane , there was a case about eight years ago where funding was made available , under a directive , from Europe to the Irish Government , but no action was taken , and as a result 50 families are now not able to carry out their normal work of mussel harvesting .
my view is that , in the present situation , we should not define Europe ’ s borders .
.
the second challenge is this : there will be repercussions .
what strikes me in the European Union &apos; s competition policy as a whole , is that although it is enjoying a great deal of attention , in the food sector , for example , the consumers , the supermarkets that is , are gradually gaining a monopoly position , and that at the same time sales from farms , the small-scale dimension , are still fragmented .
you attended as a private individual and we very much appreciated that .
I have been informed by the European transport trade unions that because of their intervention the United Kingdom hauliers blocked in Calais have just been released due to an intervention by the unions and I hope that kind of intervention will have wider effects on the nationals and the businesses of other countries .
finally , the resolution before us contains blatant contradictions .
that was stressed very much at the December European Council and I would like to thank the three rapporteurs for having made this point clearly .
employees have nothing to gain by following this route which only leads to unemployment , a lower quality of life , marginalisation and eventual destitution .
a transparent framework is required within which the delegations select the right projects .
what better examples of successful terrorism are there than those of Communism in Russia , Eastern Europe and Asia ?
contrary to what Parliament believes , this patent is no isolated case .
my name has been mentioned here and I wish to make a reply .
however , in a spirit of goodwill I withdraw these amendments as well .
we therefore proposed that resources be allocated at European level to assist the promotion , monitoring and assessment of an ecologically and socially sustainable tourism policy , which , however , was rejected .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this directive on pressure equipment is intended to harmonize the national regulations in this field which have been in force up to now .
we will thereby complete the historic process of passing from our countries each having their own currencies to sharing the same currency within the Economic and Monetary Union .
the committee is pleased to note that cooperation in terms of responses and improvement during the next financial year are one of the Council &apos;s objectives , as well as overcoming the discrepancies between the physical inventory and the accounting inventory .
latterly the regime has become concerned about the financial independence of small entrepreneurs and taken repressive measures against them .
they see some of our children drafted into the army as soldiers , or treated as prostitutes or slaves .
I have here the Framework Agreement between Parliament and the Commission agreed just two years ago .
this crisis of confidence then spread to Japan , South Africa , Latin America and finally , for political reasons , to Russia as well .
the debate is closed .
this proposal largely takes its inspiration from the European regulation on the CO2 emissions of cars , which has been in force since 2008 .
however , encouraged by the European Union , the UK Government has increased house building , endangering the green belt , which is particularly close to my heart because it is near to where I live on the Meriden Gap .
thirdly , it will be possible to use it in combination with mobile communications technology as a means towards introducing other services , such as , for example , rapid help in the event of accidents , local hazard warnings and the tracking of dangerous goods , to name but a few .
right now , at this precise moment , when we are breathing and speaking freely , one man , Troy Davis , is locked up in a cell , counting the minutes left of his life .
independently of the complaints being referred , the initiatives taken by the Ombudsman are therefore very welcome , particularly as regards the definition of this notion of maladministration , which is not always easy to grasp .
listen to them before it is too late !
Mr President , for nine years I have sat in this Chamber and heard lots of pleas for a common foreign and security policy .
I am not questioning the victims ; I am questioning the use , by Italian Members , of a Thursday afternoon sitting reserved for human rights issues to debate an issue which strictly concerns Italy and Brazil .
we will not conduct that debate until we know that the substantive negotiations which will have to be held are also to be successful .
but the Commission is a political democracy .
that does not mean that one cannot comment on the judgment .
instead , there is a need to focus on bringing about the internal market ; to put pressure on the Member States to implement EC legislation and remove the obstacles to this ; to reduce taxes for companies and make rigid labour markets more flexible ; and to have done with large numbers of tasks and rules that are unnecessary for promoting growth .
I am also especially opposed to the Charter of Fundamental Rights because it has been adopted by the EU despite the fact that neither of the vehicles intended for the Charter &apos;s implementation - the EU Constitution and the Lisbon treaty - has been ratified .
Madam Commissioner , in congratulating you today and in asking the House to approve this fisheries agreement , we cannot overlook the fact that we must make a very serious effort to adapt our fleet to the fishing opportunities .
in fact , in the name of the economic interests of a few multinationals , we are attempting to establish a criterion that involves new experiments and fresh suffering for animals .
was it not enough for some prime ministers and presidents to have lived a substantial part of their lives in a totalitarian regime ?
additionally , the Commission will touch upon the issue of market power in the distribution sector in the framework of a High Level Group on the competitiveness of the agrifood industry .
the plan will articulate the priorities of each country , seek out areas of cooperation and mutual benefit , lay down priorities and lines of action , set out and quantify requirements in basic sectors and make provision for resources to implement it .
an example of this is Article 750 , which states how we are to live as good neighbours alongside the peoples of Europe who have a European vocation – and right now it is Ukraine of which I am thinking .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
yet transport plays a vital role in our economy .
imagine if , in November , we had said to our fishermen that they should stay in port until February or March awaiting an opinion on provisional application !
Member States can adopt incentive measures , including tax credits for products which are extremely energy efficient .
bearing in mind the proposal for a Council decision ( COM ( 2005 ) 0060 final ) on the conclusion of an agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Azerbaijan on certain aspects of air services , replacing Member States &apos; bilateral agreements with the Republic of Azerbaijan , can the Council say how it will respond to the conduct of Azerbaijan , using the political means at its disposal ?
we cannot say , just because there is a small population which feels , due to some particular nationalist urge , the need to be liberated , that this is the same thing .
Mr President , Commissioner , I am probably going to repeat things my fellow Members have said but I believe that , as far as the Council is concerned , the thing is to repeat over and over what we think of LIFE .
in this , we are clashing with the eEurope strategy , which the Commission prepared for the Lisbon summit .
we want to maintain an element of coherence .
they are spreading alarm through references to social dumping from the new Member States and to possible threats to the European social model .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports , on behalf of the Committee on Budgets :
but the industry must be forced to act , and that is what we shall be campaigning for at the present time .
much more needs to be done , and Albania has done much more , for instance in stopping and pursuing smugglers and preventing the traffic in human beings between Albania and Italy .
more generally , the new legislation will consolidate the Agency ’ s international role and will increase its role in key sectors such as market surveillance , pharmacovigilance and public awareness of medicinal products .
firstly , I very much approve of the Commission rating the Member States .
I have no advice to give you : you have been involved in European politics longer than I - even if you look younger , you are not so young !
if there is friction , it is in fact on the following point : How to react ?
in Scotland we have had some success in this , although we also have some lessons to learn from it .
 
that is why I want to highlight some of the issues that I believe the Commission must have at the forefront .
it is not reforms that are needed where this issue is concerned . Refunds for the export of livestock from the EU should instead be completely abolished as quickly as possible .
he was talking about whole areas of Holland , France and Ireland where restrictions will be lifted .
is it to be the USA that dictates the list of terrorist organisations , the policy on terrorism , anti-missile shield strategy , Iraq , etc . ?
if national governments attempt to pass this without consulting the people , it will be a constitutional abomination .
a number of compromises were made and we respected those compromises , except in two cases where there are problems , as we sometimes find when we take compromises back to our various groups .
it is certainly true that a very large part of Latin America ’ s population lives in poverty , but it is not the EU that is the solution to the problem .
such is indisputably not the case as regards the services we are discussing today , so any European regulation in this field would be a flagrant breach of the subsidiarity principle , and , moreover , of the principles – integral to the rule of law – of necessity and proportionality if there was any interference in the functioning structures that the Member States have developed over the years .
in this context of promoting high-quality tourism , the report calls above all for a high common level of consumer protection and for more effective compliance with existing rules .
in this sense , I agree with my colleague , Mr Collins , who , wondering why there is no mention in the Commission &apos;s report of the importance of Parliament &apos;s role in the legislative process , asks that the obligation to report its results to Parliament be included in the draft revision .
furthermore , we know that the compensation proposed by the International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds ( FIPOL ) will only cover a tiny part of the damage that has been caused .
the Commission has promised to prepare a report based on the social realities , with an analysis of social trends .
it is important to allocate the maximum available resources for programmes and policies on prevention of maternal mortality .
these studies are published .
Mr President , Mr Giscard d &apos;Estaing , Mr Juncker , Mr Trichet , Mr Almunia , ladies and gentlemen , many good points have already been made .
within the Alliance , I believe it is legitimate that the Americans , who are aware of our prosperity , require us to assume an increasing share of the burden of maintaining a European defence system that has hitherto fallen almost entirely on them .
I am not seeking to make the certificate of inheritance anything less than binding , but only to delete the words &apos; unless and until proven otherwise &apos; ; on the contrary , indeed , far from wishing to do away with the certificate of inheritance &apos;s binding effect , I want to reinforce it .
I want to state at the beginning that I totally support the view put forward by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten on homeopathic medicine .
the acknowledgment by Prime Minister Erdogan of the existence of a &apos; Kurdish issue &apos; is a landmark .
all the more important then are the respect for human rights , ethnic minorities and dissidents and the abolition of child labour .
nonetheless , the Commission &apos;s proposal needs to be modified in two respects . The scope of the future directives should be extended to bunker oil and marine diesel .
a number of my fellow-Members who have spoken in the course of the last hour also need to be reminded that we have already had experience of a situation – in Europe , too – in which two powers , armed to the teeth with nuclear weapons , were squaring up to each other .
a report launched in the UK just yesterday by a number of environmental NGOs including Friends of the Earth forcefully made the case that one flight to and from the US could cause more pollution than the average UK motorist causes in a year .
I think that there is too little talk about skills in this context and too much about accumulating knowledge .
all this must lead us to intensify our action in favour of developing a common cultural area , within which our cultures can flourish further in all their unique features , in all their diversity , but may also be mutually enriched and the other citizens of Europe may participate fully in them .
secondly I consider it wrong that decoupling is being prematurely implemented .
we can never avoid bad things , but the question , in a democratic society , is how we handle such cases and how we develop a systemic response capable of dealing with all possible nasty surprises .
it is very encouraging that Member States have recognized that trafficking is a violation of human rights and they have a common interest in fighting it .
I , too , am disappointed that the legal agreement failed to materialise , and I should like to put a question to the President-in-Office .
but , there has been a positive development , despite the problems with the Treaty , in that Commissioner Gradin has initiated several good proposals on asylum , &apos; burden sharing &apos; , immigration , corruption and synthetic drugs .
in anticipation of this request being met , I now want to take the opportunity of wishing all socialist women success with the &quot; Women &apos; s World Marches &quot; which are to begin this spring on International Women &apos; s Day .
I would now like to turn to Amendment No 17 , Article 39 , Indents 2 and 3 relating to each institution &apos;s power to overrule its financial controller , following a refusal of the approval or visa on the budgetary transaction .
( the President cut off the speaker )
because since 1983 , not very much has changed in the welfare of animals as far as transport is concerned .
before proceeding to draw up a draft negotiating mandate , and following discussions in many countries on the Commission &apos;s Green Paper and also following Parliament &apos;s work , including the Martens report , the Commission helpfully sent a new communication to the Council of Ministers and to Parliament throwing some light on the issue and enabling the growing convergence in direction which the honourable Minister has just noted .
it is good that after this law has been in force for three years we will be able to revise provisions which have proved to be insufficiently effective , so that it will really be a system which guarantees democratic discussion .
Europe is not hungry at present .
in conclusion I can therefore say that I welcome the present agreement , and shall be voting in favour of it .
amendment Nos 16 , 22 and 47 are essential .
so the proposals from the Commission and Council remain , however much I regret it , pure propaganda as long as they are not followed by definite measures .
hence , even without the forthcoming single currency , respect for convergence criteria and some kind of stability pact would be necessary in any case in order not to expose the European economic system and its market - which are more and more closely associated - to the dangers of a shock effect which would have all kinds of serious consequences .
what we would have liked to see are monitoring programmes before the seven years are up , i.e. a fixed time-limit but with monitoring programmes that start before that date .
every year , thousands of people drive across the continent on holiday .
it is already the case today that many countries are experiencing problems due to the growing cost of pensions , and such problems may undermine the principle of intergenerational solidarity .
we German Social Democrats will vote for a higher retention and we will also vote for the continuation of the silent capital contributions , because a competition policy that attacks a business model and that has nothing to do with restructuring the banks is unfair .
therefore , and taking into account Parliament &apos;s commitment to participate in the fight against poverty and social exclusion , I believe the minimum income scheme based on 60 % of median income in the Member State concerned is an important contribution to economic and social cohesion .
what international prevention strategies can be put in place given , on the one hand , the extreme mobility of the virus and , on the other , the importance of passenger and goods traffic across the globe ?
my second point relates to the very concept of complementarity , which must not be viewed as a protective principle for preserving the competences of the Member States in this field , but as a manifestation of a political will to unite our efforts to improve and contribute more effectively to implementing the objectives of our policies on development cooperation .
I have just returned from Geneva where , along with the Parliament delegation , I attended the 58th meeting of the UN Human Rights Committee .
the rapporteur therefore has the full support , and the congratulations , of the Socialist Group .
what truth is there to this ?
the &apos; Youth on the Move &apos; report is one of the most important initiatives included in the EU 2020 strategy for promoting and providing more opportunities for education and training for young people and helping them to make the transition from education to the labour market .
combined with a credible accession perspective , conditionality works .
.
we want Croatia to be in the European Union by next year or , at the latest , the year after that .
at this point I turn to look the Commissioner , Mrs Bonino , straight in the eye . Public health : the burden will be yours , and I do not envy you your task !
they castigated agrochemical companies , the use of GMOs and the development of biomass fuels to the detriment of crop growing .
the European Union and the Member States must be on the front line of this fight .
the citizens of the European Union will also be the losers as a result of this end to operating subsidies for 2004 .
this is what we are going to discuss tonight .
social convergence is also needed before the enlargement of the Union , partly in order to strengthen the social model and partly to combat the risk of social dumping .
the victims of its structural adjustment programmes will be delighted to hear this , and will not be particularly convinced by the request to the IMF to henceforth allow for &apos; social aspects &apos; .
I have been a substitute member of the Committee on Petitions for six years and during that time , I have worked very closely with some petitioners and listened very carefully to others .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
this is at the root of the crisis , and when people talk about sustainable development , it is not just about a few piecemeal measures , it is about trying to explain and to understand that , while there are areas that need growth , that is , selective growth - renewables , and so on - there are a whole host of areas that need to be curbed .
Madam President , as the rapporteur for last year &apos;s report on human rights , I would like to ask Mr Tomlinson to look at that report again , and to read the chapter on the rights of unions and union representatives .
Mr President , I simply wish to say , on behalf of my group , that we are happy with this change to the agenda , since we believe that , furthermore , this change will allow the Danish Foreign Minister to be present at the debate , meaning that there will be participation on the part of the Council .
I should also like to thank you for paying homage to the historic work of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl .
I must congratulate the Commission on this attempt to make some changes to the laws on the distribution of European cinematographic works and I welcome some aspects of the communication , to which I shall refer shortly .
we call on the Government of Bangladesh to lift the state of emergency and respect human rights , which will help to maintain democratic standards during the course of the elections .
it has not been kept secret : it is in your hands .
Super-credits , phase-in periods and pooling will water down what is already a weak limit even further .
in order to achieve the proposed results , we must keep the main criteria for allocating funds according to the level of development and the convergence between the EU &apos;s regions .
I would also like to thank the European Parliament very sincerely , and you in particular , Mr Costa Neves , as the general rapporteur on the coming year &apos;s budget .
perhaps the one good thing that could come out of President Bush &apos;s unilateral introduction of tariffs on steel imports would be a much-needed serious debate about the flaws and weaknesses inherent in the free-trade model , because there is growing opposition to the global inequality inherent in its diktat that every country must put international competitiveness above all other domestic concerns .
what does the Commission intend to do to act in good time , for example to give legal personality to Carrefours and to Info-Points by applying Articles 54 , 55 and 185 of Council Regulation No 1605 of 2002 ?
more than other parties the Liberals have supported the Commission &apos;s proposed negotiating plan .
this begins during the school years , during PE classes , and extends right through to high-performance training in top-class sport , for here far too little consideration is given to female traits and female biological requirements .
the law against gender violence is a necessary and essential instrument .
this approach is the basis on which my counterparts in the other fourteen Member States and I have been working , in close collaboration with Commissioner Viviane Reding .
( FR ) Mr President , one of our fellow Members has just spoken about the issue of intergroups .
in terms of defence , I would just like to ask one question : how can Europe be credible without defence worthy of the name ?
very well , since you do not wish to be quiet , I am going to give the floor to the group chairmen who have not yet spoken on this matter .
in writing . - ( SV ) It is terrible that such a large proportion of the world &apos;s population lives in extreme poverty , that women in these countries and areas die during pregnancy or childbirth , and that so many people lack information on and access to safe contraception .
by adopting the Dary report , we will be sending the Council and the Commission the clear signal that our Parliament is determined to defend the interests of Community and ACP producers , to make the WTO recognise that the preferential agreements constitute development aid instruments .
anyone who is responsible for this ever steeper downward spiral in this country that was once so proud must be called to account , including ministers , representatives , army leaders , the police and the secret service , as well as the governor of the central bank .
Mr President , I am therefore calling for additional attention to be paid to enforcement .
the way in which the Member States achieve this depends a great deal on the Member States themselves .
( FR ) I am now going to speak in French .
there is a danger of the European Union &apos; s one day being ridiculed and taken advantage of internationally because of its generosity .
furthermore , animal traceability has not been guaranteed .
it is because they failed to do a piece of political homework that would have demonstrated their responsibility towards their citizens .
Mr President , the draft treaty that we have before us has aroused in many of us mixed feelings of hope and fear .
that is a view shared by many in this House and also one shared by many European Union governments .
Mr Corbett , leaving aside my personal opinions , where I tend to agree with your feelings and opinion , the problem will certainly be referred to the Bureau under the terms of Rule 147 and I am sure the President will follow it up in accordance with the provisions of Rule 147 .
the EU also supports financial police cooperation with Ukraine through a twinning project , increasing the capacity of the Ukrainian police and the European Union Border Assistance Mission ( EUBAM ) .
Mr President , I just want to take the opportunity of asking Commissioner Wallström and others to speak in their respective native languages here in the Chamber - in Mrs Wallström &apos; s case , Swedish .
a major exception to this has just been adopted .
the position maintained by France is shared by a large section of the international community , and in the Security Council , the sole legal body authorised to legitimise the use of force on an international scale , there has never been a majority sufficient to authorise an early recourse to war .
in order to turn the initiative into a real success , it is important to help the least developed countries gain market access .
there is a possibility of exchange of scientific information and of exchanges in the policy of training of research workers which I think might be enormously profitable for both the Kingdom of Morocco and the European Union .
therefore , Conservatives have voted to decrease many areas of EU spending .
thank you very much , Commissioner .
it is a particular practice in my own country that has reached epidemic proportions .
in order to change this , we must also support the call for the embargo against Cuba to be lifted .
since we cannot , apparently , take the issue to the WTO , it is essential that in the context of the overall partnership between the United States and Europe , the European Union should be able to protect those legitimate interests which will , in the long term , work to the benefit of both the American and the European airlines .
the next item is Question Time .
finally , European institutions will not rise in the public esteem through a multitude of regulations , directives and so on , but rather by acting transparently to benefit the people and strengthen the idea of Europe .
she has been exemplary in the way she has attended to her task as rapporteur .
we cannot simply squander the Earth &apos;s scarce resources .
the human rights policy of the European Community and indeed of the wider international community played an important part in the fall of the undemocratic regimes in Southern Europe in the 1970s and in Central and Eastern Europe after 1989 .
I have touched on only some of the multitude of problems that have to be faced by companies in trying to develop international rail freight services .
in any event , Commissioner , I would like to make it clear that we do not believe that the Commission has acted intentionally , and we can therefore start dealing with the issue itself , which is very important to the Europeans .
in addition , the revision of the basic regulation on the control of fishing is expected by the end of 2008 .
I shall explain that proposal very briefly .
however , I am against total harmonisation of the EU &apos;s asylum policy .
there is a European advertising standards alliance and we do not want to create some separate organization - some new quango , as we say in British usage - to replicate what that does .
there are also problems there with the implementation of a market economy .
it would be horrendous if we did , and also the market would suffer and prices to consumers would rise , and there would be protests and revolt .
in this situation , if we want to have influence in the post-Soviet space and consolidate the positions of democracy and human rights in this region , then we must work with Ukraine , and more actively than ever before .
our short-sighted attitude to the future , despite the fact that we can already see clearly what is likely to happen , and this approach to international relations are disturbing as well as wholly unconvincing and herald much greater destruction than what we ourselves are already facilitating today .
about an hour after a decision has been taken , we hold a press conference and give all the necessary background and explanations which led us to take that decision and subsequently , in a question-and-answer session , we answer all the questions relating to it .
it is therefore not primarily a case of more or less border control , but of efficient and coherent police cooperation .
the comments about alcoholic drinks and tobacco clearly showed that the issue is a complex and sensitive one .
here too there is no trace of this report .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
this will work if we succeed in compensating for the present disadvantages of renewable energy sources in competition with current fossil and nuclear energy sources , and if we manage to make the production and use of energy reflect the costs involved .
I am therefore well disposed towards the Purvis report , which suggests investigation into different measures that might benefit the consumer through , for example , competition among mortgage lenders , but I have no choice but to vote against it on the grounds that the report is not very clear about the different systems of tax benefits when mortgages are concluded , and particularly harmonised .
and my last question is : will our Greek friends drop their resistance to financial cooperation ?
Mr Baldarelli mentioned this a few minutes ago .
this hierarchy comprises above all prevention , then re-use and subsequently treatment , and in this treatment phase landfill is the last option .
we have the information concerning one case , to which I will come back a little later .
we have also identified this in other parts of the world .
it is likely that the camp discovered is not the only one of its kind .
at the beginning of April , the Commission had the opportunity to meet with the new Ombudsman and congratulate him on his election .
the pressure of competition on the internal market and the cross-border environmental aspects require a common approach here .
treating sportspeople , especially youngsters , as if they were goods to be traded denies them the opportunity to continue a career outside sport as adults .
on the basis of the data gathered and of the analysis of the results obtained , the Committee on Regional Development underlines , in Mr Luhan &apos;s report , the close relationship between competition and cohesion , and proposes corrective actions for the next programming period .
that calls for increased cooperation between the African Union , the European Union and other organisations , in particular those of the United Nations .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
in a question like climate change , the European Union justifies its existence .
the next item is the order of business .
the debate is closed .
however , I would like to take this opportunity to state that , in my opinion , there is a lack of democracy in the way the delegates from the European Parliament to the Convention were chosen .
the question can again be asked today .
we need to go a little further ; I believe that the rapporteur ’ s proposal and the compromise amendments are balanced , and that we had to ensure that anybody carrying out any act against industrial or intellectual property could be prosecuted , whether that act was for commercial purposes or not .
I hope and pray for recommendations from the ECB to combat crony capitalism , to introduce better regulation and supervision , in short , to create the conditions to enable us to regain the general public &apos;s confidence in an ethical financial sector .
Serbia &apos;s democratic government and President Tadić deserve our support .
but above all , we will only create an information society and create networks if the people accept them , if there is a demand for them .
I do , however , support the calls in the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs drawn up by Mr Sterckx for a comprehensive impact assessment ahead of the general revision of the Fourth Company Law Directive that has been announced to us .
the purpose of the proposed amendment to the Directive is to adapt it to the UN Protocol on combating organised crime , as concerns the legal purchase and trade in firearms intended purely for civilian use .
the safety of all those on the roads and , of course , not least of those drivers directly involved , must therefore be absolutely ensured .
subject : European Voluntary Service for Young People and the 1998 World Cup
.
I think that such harmonisation , even to a minimal extent , is inconceivable at the present stage in view of the different way contractual relations are regulated in Member States .
for my part , I believe we need a solution other than &apos; nothing &apos; , so I hope that you will adopt a slightly more flexible approach by the end of our debate .
for this reason , I highlighted the need to move towards a well-organised European training institute for judges and lawyers , with adequate resources , yet referred to the need to avoid pointless duplication between existing facilities and highlighted the important role of national schools .
in 2005 , 51 % of the waste shipments checked were found to be illegal .
does it also realise that this is a booming market affecting twelve of the fifteen Member States ?
a lot of work is needed here , and we , of course , support the programme drawn up by the Palestinian authorities : Palestine : Ending the Occupation , Establishing a State .
as regards immediate action , it could grant generous help at no cost from funds from the unused resources of the legislated expenditure .
only the genuine addition of real money from the pockets of taxpayers in the north will make a difference .
at the very least , we do not seem to have achieved equality of opportunity .
I would therefore call upon the President of this Parliament to appeal urgently to the government of the Philippines and to the President of that country and call on them to ensure that she exercise her right to pardon Francisco Larrañaga so that this European and Spanish citizen is not executed .
applause
they do not have such a high percentage of educated people there or as many universities as we do .
vote
this kind of situation will most probably lead to conflicts over oil being superseded by conflicts over drinking water and food or by a fight for survival .
one of the options is possibly to set up an insurance system throughout Europe , which would also promote fair competition .
Denmark ’ s point of departure is that the European Parliament must have greater , not less , influence over the budget .
I personally consider many of the issues from the submitted report to be exceptionally important .
therefore , Amendment No 3 is not necessary .
Mr Balfe , I was referring to when you gave evidence as a witness .
food manufacturers spend a thousand times more on marketing than governments spend on fighting obesity .
that will be our guiding principle when we amend this proposal .
the vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon .
 
finally , following on from this , I should like to ask the President-in-Office about the part played by the European Commission in promoting the viability of levels of competitiveness and employment , following instructions from the Council , especially in the wake of the Cardiff Agreement .
I really hope that a solution can be found to these difficult institutional problems to make the financial management of this House credible in all fields .
such new products and services could frequently require a more solid technological base than is available in many such small enterprises , therefore the Eurostars joint research and development programme aimed at supporting SMEs could be very important because of its potential impact on the &apos; real economy &apos; .
nowhere does anybody name the main causes , those guilty of this situation , that is , the jungle of the law of multinational interests and unbridled competition , which has run amok , in the pursuit of profit in the context of the arrant free market .
Parliament &apos;s role is an essential part of the Treaty of Lisbon and it should be respected by all parties concerned .
in acknowledging that there is still much work to be done , the Commission also notes that important progress is made every year and that the overall management of EU funds is sound .
the occupying forces and their collaborators are preventing the inhabitants from leaving and are giving out hardly any information about civilians , and even less about the dead .
I cannot pretend that the Hong Kong conference was a staggering success : it was not .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
that is why the Council will continue to press for free access for diplomats and international organisations .
I have voted in favour of the resolution because it is important for us in the European Union to make our opinion clear on this .
that is what we should do .
faced with today &apos; s tragic circumstances , which are worsened by the international crisis , I firmly believe that the various parliamentary Groups should put our party political differences to one side , which would make our contribution , and that of the representatives of the European Union in this region , all the more effective .
and yet we go on here as though nothing had happened and at best we keep setting up new corporative consultation mechanisms .
that , ladies and gentlemen , is the content of the message of the European Council held on 21 September .
Mr President , I should like to comment on what Mr MacCormick said .
I warmly welcome the release of the champion of the fight against discrimination against women , Khadijeh Moghaddam .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to point out to my colleagues the fact that all the political groups are perfectly entitled to issue an invitation to a presidential candidate and , of course , to discuss with him his views on what his future work will entail .
Mr President , this proposal for a directive is a stroke of luck for the environment , since assigning responsibility to the manufacturer was long overdue and it was also high time waste prevention applied to the motor vehicle sector too .
we are going into the election period and the Commission would have an ideal opportunity to conduct further consultations with the sector throughout the Mediterranean basin , and come back in the new mandate with a reworked , revised proposal , which this House may then find acceptable .
Mr Poignant , listening to you singing the Marseillaise or even the European anthem would certainly be a great pleasure .
it simply means that liberalisation has to be on the Member State &apos;s own terms .
it is high-risk and there are unknown risks which lie ahead .
it is a directive that introduces rigorous limits on the use of 33 substances , notably insecticides , chemical and industrial substances and heavy metals .
these high standards of health and consumer protection look like protectionism to the outside world .
improvements are necessary with regard to the Agenda 2000 , which the Parliament is also discussing : liberalization on the one hand , increased levies for European agriculture and at the same time a reduction of expenditure , Mr President-in-Office of the Council .
the voting and the preparatory work can be followed on the Internet , and hundreds of thousands of visitors to the locations in Strasbourg and Brussels get a sense of how the work proceeds .
to answer Mr Ripa Di Meana &apos;s question , the Luxembourg Presidency has now proposed ECU 30 million as another compromise , which is in fact , the lowest common denominator and , according to the Commission , at least has the merit of coherence , inasmuch as this quite large reduction in the total allocation , is the result of the limitation of the action to the cinema industry , and to small and medium budget productions .
this instability is having an adverse effect on the process of far-reaching institutional reform needed if it is to join the EU .
the nature of such a tax , its rate and setting the tax base are some of the very few instruments that still remain within the remit of the Member States and can be used to accelerate the economic development of less developed countries .
a massive consciousness-raising campaign must be launched and Europe must put this crude form of racial discrimination on the international agenda , to begin with at the forthcoming World Racism conference in Durban .
but in the time I have available , I want to highlight a few important points .
I therefore call upon the Council and the Commission to be among the first to tackle robustly the Burmese rulers and Beijing about their shared responsibility for the suffering of the Burmese people .
in this regard , I believe that it is not enough for us to go out and urge women to take part in the elections .
when , a year ago , the Council of Ministers made up its mind to change the common position it had had for many years and , instead , began to talk with the regime , it imagined it could see some kind of opening up in Cuba , with possibilities there .
it is obviously regrettable that Kosovo , because of disagreements between Member States regarding recognition of its independence , is not included in this process under way between the European Union and countries in the Balkans .
that is a form of violence and should , in my view , be punishable in the same way as other forms of violence .
unfortunately , an opportunity was missed in Nice to strengthen OLAF by creating a European Financial Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office and putting it under judicial control .
thank you , Mr López Garrido , I hope the Spanish Presidency will help to resolve all of these uncertainties , because I am convinced that these will be seen as momentous times in Europe &apos;s history when the time comes .
in those circumstances , it is somewhat futile to wrangle endlessly about whether , for example , a deficit which comes &apos; close to 3 % &apos; ( according to Article 104c ( 2 ) ) may amount to 3.2 or 3.6 % .
statistics are also needed on supply and demand for child care and on parental leave .
Mr President , the first point that I think needs to be stressed here follows on from what my colleague , Mr Brok , said about the involvement of the EU institutions and what Parliament is requesting from the Council with this report : namely , that the EU institutions and the Community method be involved in resolving this issue of the permanent stability mechanism of the stability fund .
it is in line with these interests that administrative procedures must be designed , established and implemented to respect and value the efforts of those who are responsible for the future of as many families as there are workers employed in a company .
when there are not enough jobs for everyone , they must be rationed and shared .
or those who say , &quot; Let &apos;s put the thumbscrews on the agriculture ministers . &quot;
however , I was , of course , disappointed by the result , because President Yanukovich is no Western-style democrat .
they cannot restrict the role of the European Parliament .
recycling , air emissions , climate change , sustainable consumption and production must be monitored continuously in order to achieve progress in these areas across the whole of Europe .
so , by all means , let us have parity of treatment , but let us understand the detriment suffered to date by those who , for years , have kept to the rules on pain of savage punishment .
may I quote the only one who is not here .
I will be delighted to take charge of those papers .
clearly , the Commission accepts Amendment No 17 in that same perspective . It also accepts Amendment No 23 , except for the second paragraph ; this cannot technically be deleted because in the event of derogation from the first and second banking directives , neither the competent authorities nor the own funds would any longer be defined .
apart from this basic conflict , the other mid-term adaptations are consensus between the three institutions ( with the exception of the ICI + ) .
this debate has also highlighted other important but wider issues of competition policy reform .
I would like to put on record my disappointment at Mr Allister &apos;s comment on Mrs de Brún speaking a language &apos; no one cares to understand &apos; .
I asked for the floor on the matter raised by Mrs Villiers , in order to decry yet another act of terrorism on the part of the Turkish occupying forces in North Cyprus .
that is not the case at the moment .
we are familiar with the pattern from many national parties which have distanced themselves from the electorate and instead allow themselves to be financed by the State , business and the unions .
neither should we forget that Burma tolerates slave labour and is Asia &apos;s largest drugs exporter .
how to make preventing armed conflicts and preventing the existence of dictators compatible is the great challenge facing the international community .
Mrs Berès mentioned Mittal ’ s bid for Arcelor .
on expenditure , and specifically agricultural spending , the Council deplores the absence of responsible spending on measures to counter fraud and irregularities .
I would therefore be pleased if Parliament would support the Commission in its efforts to be proactive rather than reactive in its proposed legislation .
we in Europe should have more confidence in our own ability .
with the involvement of all the presidencies in these efforts in the last couple of years , the European Union has invested an enormous amount of energy and effort in solving the Cyprus dilemma .
as an MEP who has always paid particular attention to issues relating to crime prevention , security and police cooperation , I acknowledge the fundamental importance of Europol in creating a secure European area and preventing crime throughout Europe , along with the need for it to be reinforced at various levels , including those under discussion here .
despite all of this , the funding is still meagre .
the interim agreement also signed on 9 April provides for the trade-related provisions of the agreement to enter into force from 1 June 2001 , without having to wait for the formal ratification of the agreement by national parliaments .
it does not say anything about the future , what the new strategies are to be , what the new development trends are .
in my opinion , the success of the Stockholm Programme can be gauged by the respect shown for four issues : the existence of concrete achievements benefiting the citizens ; scrupulous respect for the new role of the European Parliament - codecision being an element of added value ; the quality of the application of the Stockholm Programme by the national parliaments ; and the awareness of its values among the citizens , and especially among Europe &apos;s young people .
I believe that this is a mistake .
to conclude , I hope that the interministerial preparatory conference in Palermo next June , and the Euro-Mediterranean forum itself that should be set up shortly , will revive a Euro-Mediterranean policy that started off full of expectations but that has lost its polish and political tension , disregarding the basic problem , namely the blocking of the peace process between Israel and Palestine .
Mrs Sommer has already talked about the basic content of the current text .
I believe we have to go a bit further down that road .
twenty years ago , hundreds of thousands of Europeans marched down the streets calling for the release of the Chilean disappeared .
it is following developments very closely through our delegation in Cairo , and in partnership with the Member States .
precisely for this reason - because we use them for the control and evaluation of the CAP , because they are a basic tool - they must be faithful to the reality of the agriculture they are reflecting .
but I do agree that we need to be more efficient .
the European Action Plan against terrorism must be the Union ’ s basic political tool in this area .
if we want to exorcise for good the demons that escaped from Pandora &apos;s box when technological progress lifted the lid , our training systems must become the mirror of society , reflecting it in their methods and technology .
I spoke to a farmer from Zimbabwe just last week at a conference in Brussels and the harm that has been done to the food production base of that country is quite horrific .
therefore , I wonder why the words of such an intensely European programme which are so dear to you , Mr Poettering , and to us all , can cause such concern .
I should like to thank you for your contribution to this House .
and the question is an eminently political one , concerning the role that must be given to SMEs in the execution of the framework programme and its individual programmes .
some amendments concern the current financial year .
the oft-repeated excuse that reducing emission levels is too expensive is suicidal .
these two questions are very much related and it is difficult to separate them because they rightly raise the problem of the cost of banking transactions now that the euro has been introduced .
we are now going to vote on the four reports concerning codecision .
at the same time , parts of the report are critical of the EU and recognise increasing wage differences , greater poverty and the advantages of the Scandinavian model .
however , funding for the Youth programme is not just critical , it is paramount .
why does he not enter into a voluntary debate with the groups in this House , so that we can get to know one another better at the beginning of his period of office ?
I fully support the move to create a European network of permanent national football information points .
I also agree with the rapporteur , I agree with you , Mr Bösch , that we must make the statistics more meaningful so we can see which are the new reports and which were already in the statistics before .
it is surprising that , although a number of countries , including the allies of the United States are dictatorships , Iraq , a Muslim country that is secular and tolerant towards religions and minorities - the Deputy Prime Minister is Christian and three government ministers are Kurds - is their number one target .
the key to achieving the European Union &apos;s most desired human rights objective also lies in the activities of the non-governmental sector which highlights unfair trials that scandalously impose harsh sentences , like the one handed down in Iran to a boy who was only 16 at the time he committed his alleged crime .
 
the countries involved must be reminded of their duty to monitor existing rules effectively .
security must of course continue to be a priority , but it is also crucial for the Afghan people to see how the aid specifically benefits them .
this includes having respect for democracy , human rights and the rule of law , as well as for the basic freedoms guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and other international treaties to which Azerbaijan is party .
instead , comprehensive victim protection must ensure a permanent residence permit , thus granting full access to medical and social support without preconditions .
Europeans are digitally dependent nowadays , and we wish to be digitally dependent , but with the proviso that we feel safe and secure on the Internet .
this is why I think that it is very important to implement the first amendment tabled in the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy , which allows the possibility of exporting spent fuel and radioactive waste to third countries , if standards are applied in these countries which are as high as ours .
so , if you want the State &apos;s sympathy , do you have to burn and ransack a town , as hundreds of thugs did , claiming to be avenging the death of their &apos; mates &apos; Moushin and Larami ?
there were a large number of British soldiers in the Balkan War and , of course in the Gulf , and as a British Conservative I will say this : Of course , we are concerned about the possible impact of the use of depleted uranium , but against the background of Mr Solana &apos;s statement , we do not believe that NATO should adopt a moratorium on the use of such weapons .
that means that we need to work on a sound patent regime , fair competition and free trade in the internal market , and in this connection it is regrettable – I should like to say this once again – that we failed to actually open up the market for services .
Mr President , I am sorry to have to say that when I asked you how long you thought the voting would take you said five or ten minutes .
I honestly do not understand : why does the Commission refuse to do for earthquakes what it did for floods ?
the other is the regular annual underspend of the regional funds .
we therefore have to consider - and I know this is being considered in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs - demanding from the Commission a legal framework to protect services of general economic interest , especially in the social field , and I think that such a framework , were it to be provided , would be a good thing .
however , how can we ever expect to achieve any sort of transparency in the use of Community funds ?
the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations voted in favour of all the amendments improving the Council &apos;s proposal for a monitoring mechanism for CO2 emissions .
( LT ) The Commission &apos;s position on the Council regulation on the Common Market Organisation for Wine discriminates against certain countries , especially the new Member States .
first , then , I want to highlight the importance of this early warning system ; secondly , it is essential for women to be included in all stages of the peace process , because they are not caught up in the traditional models of combative behaviour , or not to the same extent as men .
who wants suffering ; who wants war ?
unfortunately , this trust has never been great .
the countries and the companies of the European Union have a key role to play in this process .
it is clear enough that there are differences between the countries , including with regard to how close they are to fulfilling the requirements made by the EU , but seen in the light of the process of change Europe is in the middle of , it is the wrong time to make such a static division .
thus when we talk about Europe &apos;s monetary policy and the euro , we must appreciate that the effect of this or that decision will vary greatly depending on the group of residents ; I welcome the European Central Bank &apos;s intention to analyse the influence on resident groups .
and this is understandable .
now there is a timetable for the route map and the period of reflection is to be followed by a period of results .
I hope that I will not be repeating what other people have said , or at least not too much , and can I ask them to bear in mind my apology for that ?
one proposal , therefore , envisages access as a two-stage procedure , which would mean that the purely formal aspects would be scrutinised first , followed at the second stage by examination of the content .
further delay will amount to the deliberate undermining of parliamentary democracy .
so there is a need for this European dimension .
a proposal for the formulation of such a study is already being drawn up by the Commission .
the 20 % renewable energy requirement is the first time that we have had a European process that impacts on the decision in relation to the energy mix otherwise decided solely by the Member States themselves .
his work has certainly fostered excellent cooperation between us and has facilitated the success of this excellent proposal . This is due to the courageous initiative taken by Commissioner Busquin , and involves allocating a total of EUR 600 million to large-scale research with the objective of combating HIV / AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis under the EDCTP programme .
I believe that this perspective on membership has contributed to the fact that talks will probably very soon begin on how to solve the Cyprus problem .
how can we square this encouragement of increased consumerism with the need to use resources wisely ?
what sources are available to support the further evolution of solar thermal electricity ?
we support the call for a detailed charter of patients ’ rights , designed to bring about a high-quality health system in the short , medium and long term , based on solidarity .
for example , the Highlands and Islands include some of the most isolated islands in Europe with extreme problems of transport because of weather and tidal conditions and the costs involved .
this is why I particularly support the idea of introducing a parliamentary dimension into the United Nations system .
well , then , Morocco-European Union relations must be seriously affected .
it is , for example , unacceptable that Austrian postal legislation should impose disproportionately high sanctions on those who omit to fit new letterboxes on their houses .
we had discussions with President Karzai and with many members of his cabinet , and appealed to them in unambiguous terms for the Petersberg resolutions to be implemented only with women participating in the proper way .
however in itself , it is not a guarantee : political leaders will now need to make some important decisions in order to live up to it .
in order to reduce the gap between the worst and best developed national economies there must also be agreed social and environmental standards as well as consumer and health protection .
for some time , the Commission has already been carrying out impact assessments of legislation before submitting legislative proposals to the European Parliament and the Council , but the report states that these impact assessment procedures still need to be greatly improved .
these expressions are stated in more detail in my amendment to the resolution under discussion .
I think we all agree in recognizing that transatlantic dialogue is extremely important , not only out of technical and commercial considerations , but also because the foreign trade and direct foreign investment figures testify to very major economic ties between the European Union and the United States of America .
the development project CDI-Bwamanda , for its part , states that local agriculture has to contend with far too high general costs .
it is striking to me how far we have come in the last ten years .
I cannot support those who are in favour of incorporating the resources of the European Central Bank into the European Union &apos; s budget .
in the case of bottlenecks , with much less action in terms of budget , we can achieve multiplier effects .
the common position expressly mentions the victims of exploitation and sexual abuse which would be covered by the programme , as well as the common establishment of priorities , promoting innovation and the exchange of experiences regarding actions taken by Member States , including the exchange of information on different legislation and the results obtained .
we are well aware that organised crime and small-scale crime are two distinct phenomena requiring different answers . Organised crime is a priority area for the Union and its Member States , whereas small-scale crime is primarily a matter for local , regional and national institutions .
that discussion would have been completely different without the participation of members of the Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement .
it is now 10 years since the Chernobyl accident occurred .
these revolutions are secular revolutions on the part of Tunisians and Egyptians who simply want democracy and development , which are intrinsically linked .
I would like to ask you to instruct the relevant department to ensure that the entrance area is made safe again .
what does this proposal for &quot; joint action &apos; contain ?
Mr President , the resolution we are currently debating is a sound and appropriately balanced compromise document .
I consider it necessary for us to accelerate this assistance so that it can come into operation by the start of next year , and I have therefore proposed the simplified procedure via our committee chairman .
NATO has reacted swiftly to increase troop numbers in order to provide better security .
it is too early to say how the Commission intends responding on this .
why are rail lines not being laid at the same time along these roads ?
however , I now see that my question has been put into section 3 , which means that it will not be verbally answered by Commissioner Mandelson .
in addition , the amendments introduced refer to animal welfare standards on the farm and during transport , and emergency solutions are proposed for cases of serious health crises which prevent animal movements for long periods , such as buying-in schemes , which the Commission has certainly never done before .
it is very important for Europe to demonstrate its credibility before Copenhagen and to reach agreement on the climate package .
that said , in terms of overall content it is a good agreement .
Mr President , I am pleased that the Committee on Budgets has endorsed so many of the amendments by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , in particular budget line B7-524 - assistance in the nuclear sector .
the Commission has taken precautions and measures , one step at a time , to improve the content of the programme .
the allocation of ECU 47.5 million to the European Voluntary Service for Young People is , it is true , the minimum required and much less than the European Parliament wanted , but at least it enables the project to continue .
as we have already heard , 220 000 hectares were flooded and the provisional estimates of flood damage to farming are enormous .
I also agree with the call for cooperation within the TEC on all matters affecting the regulatory environment for industries , especially small and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) , following the approach of the EU &apos; Small Business Act &apos; when considering legislation with a transatlantic impact .
this is the fruit of the simplifications we have proposed and undertaken with the Member States .
internal production control is welcomed by industry , since it can be incorporated into existing control systems for quality , the environment and health .
I should perhaps have liked to have seen the rapporteur insert just one simple clause to the effect that we must bear this concern in mind , for if we in actual fact listen to the legitimate concern the Member States may have and , at the same time , opt for the maximum solution , I think we shall succeed in combining the broad vision with the facts .
sometimes the fault was already present at the time of purchase , or occurred shortly afterwards through no fault of the consumer .
that is why tomorrow , I hope and believe , you will be defeated .
at this juncture I should like to make an appeal to my fellow Members .
crisis !
in the field of the environment alone , it is currently estimated that the cost of the necessary investment efforts in the ten countries will come to more than 100 billion euros .
today , our societies are - on average - the wealthiest in history .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the European Union is still a long way from being a political union .
in the EU , the big countries would instead dominate both chambers on the basis of the proposal we are now debating .
moreover , our country has never asked for financial support .
Mr President , this is the first time that we are to give discharge to these five agencies , and it is a new situation to which both parties must accustom themselves .
in writing . - I voted against the amendments to the Breyer report .
the EU must take this opportunity for openness and transparency .
air transport is enormously important for the European economy and as individuals , we depend on a thriving and efficient air transport industry where safety for crew and passengers is the first prerogative .
the next item is the report ( A5-0200 / 2000 ) by Mr Gutiérrez-Cortines , on behalf of the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport , on the Commission report to the Council , the European Parliament , the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the implementation , results and overall assessment of the European Year of Lifelong Learning ( 1996 ) , submitted pursuant to Article 8 of European Parliament and Council Decision 2493 / 95 / EC &#91; COM ( 1999 ) 447 - C5-0205 / 1999 - 1999 / 2163 ( COS ) &#93;
in 1999 , 66 % of the research workers in the State sector and 72 % of those in higher education were men .
it should be said that the rapporteur is herself part of this minority , which proves that it is not as oppressed as all that .
logically speaking , if these are good objectives for us , they should also be complied with in those countries .
( ES ) I am speaking simply to propose a minor modification to the amendment , in the name of legal rigour .
I think this would be a good idea .
reducing the interventions now instead of increasing them , as in my opinion is necessary ...
in that context the moves to include Burma in ASEAN are deeply depressing but predictable , and I call on the Commission in all trade negotiations with the ASEAN states to urge them to reconsider .
it is going to create another thousand jobs .
public institutions are the real problem : here , the proposal is for a maximum payment period of 60 days from the invoice date .
this would do much to meet the objectives laid out by the President-in-Office and to ensure that we , when we are re-elected , have the support of our citizens .
the report by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten illustrates the legitimate demands of the people in the border regions .
( DE ) ... it is the first step towards equalising the conditions for the railways with those of the roads as , at the moment , you have to pay for distance travelled on the railways , but only a very small amount for the roads .
let us hope , too , that tourism – the main source of income for a country that is still a fascinating one – will flourish once more : Namaste !
another essential task is drawing up a reasonable technology transfer policy .
I welcome your recognition that the decision to grub up must lie with the grower and , having said this , I have also studied your different suggestions very attentively .
Mr President , I asked if I could speak twenty minutes ago ; I pressed the button , and it is still alight , so I can prove it .
we wish to make it clear that we are , however , opposed to setting up a European register of convictions .
as far as the Kurdish conflict is concerned , we must welcome the rapprochement of the two rival Kurdish factions in northern Iraq as a result of the 1998 agreement on a system of power-sharing , and elections are now being prepared in order to set up a Kurdish regional assembly .
we have achieved results , albeit only partial results , but on the basis of these initiatives , a special fund of EUR 300 million has been made available to deal with the emergency .
I hope , in the context of Mr Evans &apos; report , there will be some way in which we can hear - preferably directly from the people who have been helped by this - precisely what the effect of the Tempus programme has been on their countries .
my long political experience , particularly in foreign policy , has taught me that it is not always those who shout the loudest or pass the most forceful resolutions who achieve the best results .
that also includes bullets and weapons and so on and it is an early warning system .
Europe is primarily a great ideal , and it was an ideal for the founding fathers Alcide De Gasperi and Konrad Adenauer , from Robert Schuman to Altiero Spinelli , from Gaetano Martino to Helmut Kohl .
the proposal had the merit of being based on very thorough scientific work and of providing a constructive analysis of this sensitive matter .
in Tunisia , there is , of course , as most of you have said , a very hopeful situation and we all support the democratic development there .
we were faced with a really difficult task .
that is why I believe that we should have a more innovative , yet multilateralist , conception of human rights .
that is why , in the medium and long term , our common agricultural policy must be conceived with this in mind .
( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , I would simply like to remind you that it was the polar bears on the ice floes who showed us how much chemical pollution was affecting the whole of the world .
trains run every single day , including weekends and holidays , but the freight has to be brought to them , which will be impossible if we keep the ban on weekend driving in place .
- Report : Saïd El Khadraoui
one of these issues is the &apos; Eastern Partnership &apos; , and we discussed the Eastern Partnership only last week in Parliament .
I think that is quite obvious .
if our industry is completely off the hook , the WTO will never accept a scheme whereby those who import to our markets have to pay , so there is a fundamental contradiction in what you have announced , or at least you have to clarify this because , otherwise , you are cheating people .
fortunately , with a concession to Poland &apos;s demands , the problem has finally been solved satisfactorily .
modern industrial policy is the same thing as environmental policy , and in order to allow the Union to develop better we must allow energy policy to overlap with environmental policy too .
I therefore believe that we must support organisations of women that form around networks , so that they can achieve and consolidate better living conditions .
I should like , in any event , to say that safety and the protection of the environment are closely connected to the distribution of airports , which is suffering , in practical and serious ways , as a result of the trend to centralise airports that is prevailing in most European States and which is being promoted by central governments , which , for political reasons and reasons of power , are concentrating investment in capital cities , and by the so-called flagship companies , which , for the same reasons are centralising their flights and sending them into the same airports .
this type of patent in many languages under the current European Patent Office system is actually only for large companies rather than for small and medium-sized enterprises .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I have heard Mr Schulz out .
I therefore find this proposal very worrying .
an important element of combating organised crime is the democratic supervision of those who are combating crime .
that kind of claim does not serve our interests .
this important advantage needs to be preserved , and should not be sacrificed on the altar of a misplaced desire for uniformity and simplification .
President of the Commission . - Mr President , the start of 2011 is an historic moment for Hungary as it takes over the helm of the Council of the European Union for the first time , but it is also a critical moment for the European Union as a whole .
in writing . - Pesticides are among the most dangerous chemicals , as they are designed to kill and they are released deliberately into the environment and onto food .
in view of the fact that Togo ’ s borders were drawn on a drawing board , with entire peoples and families being torn apart in the process , and other ethnic groups that had nothing in common being artificially merged , it must be said that in spite of this the country made every appearance of developing remarkably well for a number of years .
the rapporteur said that those listening to us in the gallery today may be curious as to what the word &apos; comitology &apos; means .
some of these questions have been raised in a rather polemic way , in other cases contradictions have been highlighted . In some cases there has been agreement with the form but probably not with the content .
we have thus acted faster than any Member State , particularly my own .
the example quoted by Mr Rübig concerning his daughter is very interesting in this respect .
a reduction in taxation or subsidies over an extended period would simply amount to a transfer of the fiscal income towards the OPEC countries and would send them an inappropriate message .
that shows that Europe still lacks self-respect in the face of Russia &apos;s authoritarian ideology .
this meeting is taking place at a time of rising tension between the different European Union states .
thank you , Mr de Silguy .
Mr President , just to understand , what you are telling us is that , for the vote on a Vice-President , it is impossible ever not to get a qualified majority , because , if you can only vote in favour or be taken down as abstention , and if abstentions do not count towards the total vote , then by definition , you always get a qualified majority .
.
I am pleased that this initiative has given rise to considerable interest among Member States , many of whom have underlined the importance of focusing on democratic values and respect for fundamental rights as key principles underpinning the European Union .
where relations with China are concerned , the main consideration for the Commission and Council should not be that this is a large country with a fast growing economy .
the committee held a public hearing to find out more about the &apos; non-lethal &apos; weapons and HAARP , the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Project .
although these standards are often formally obeyed , the EU is also aware that it has partners that do not comply with them on a regular basis .
my group , in conjunction with others , is going to take initiatives in this spirit , which you are all welcome to join .
neither this Parliament nor the Commission have any competence in this area .
because , in most cases , these are countries with very divided societies which need help to carry out economic reforms capable of reducing the unemployment figures and the poverty figures . Economic reforms which will create the conditions needed for consolidation or even , in some cases , for the introduction of collective policies based on solidarity , similar to what we in Europe call &apos; the welfare state &apos; .
I should like to dwell briefly on a second point which is of great concern to me , namely the relationship between technology and industrial competitiveness , to which it should somehow be possible to apply benchmarking .
the next item is the debate on the report ( A6-0227 / 2005 ) by Claude Turmes on behalf of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy on the share of renewable energy in the EU and proposals for concrete actions &#91; 2004 / 2153 ( INI ) &#93; .
do we think it is normal that a young Turkish person should have to apply for a visa to follow his football team on a trip to London , whilst his Spanish friend can do so without one ?
make no mistake : the Commission will be an active player in the search for solutions here .
this is the part of the amendment that reads , ‘ considers that allocation of funding should fall under the ‘ normal ’ EU budget and thus under the discharge authority of the EP ’ .
my third point is the main one : disarmament .
I therefore call on my fellow Members to vote against .
the question of support for Airbus is immaterial in this assessment .
the new framework for this legislation needs to restore the position of the child at the very heart of the adoption principle .
the Union does not seem to have any ambitious plans to support social cohesion between Member States .
our Member States are already able to offer temporary refuge during times of mass exodus .
I would also like to express once again my agreement with Mr van Orden that we are in this for the long haul .
there is not much point in holding the debate if the Commission and the Council are not here , but let us , at least , use it to discuss the matter amongst ourselves ; in any case , there are very few of us left in the Chamber .
clearly we must find a purpose for Strasbourg .
it may not be possible for the small farms to meet the matched funding and so what sounds generous may , in fact , for some small enterprises be meaningless .
secondly , spreading the programme out over 18 months means that there is a danger of slowing down the work of the Commission . Our group therefore believes that it would be more appropriate to retain annual , twelve-month , structuring and , above all , to require ourselves to respect the deadlines , something that does not always happen at present .
I agree with you about the value of these tools for a forward-looking policy .
I therefore appeal that the target which the Committee has set itself , i.e. of establishing the age of 18 as standard at European level , be implemented as soon as possible .
the main problems were primarily encountered in defining the scope of application . In fact , the regulation applies to all regular services , whether regional , national or international , over a distance greater than 250 km .
there is a natural long-term aspect to all this among you .
– Mr Fernández Martín and Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra , on behalf of the Group of the European People ’ s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , on Venezuela ( B5-0123 / 2004 ) ;
let us not forget that .
it is impossible for my country to suddenly cover this deficit when factories are closing , when factories are relocating outside Greece because they cannot meet the costs of the very strong euro .
because there are considerable ethical problems and I believe that everyone is aware of what they are .
( CS ) I also feel very deeply for the people of the Gaza Strip , who have become hostages in the hands of Hamas .
in fact , as has already been said , this agreement brings mutual advantages and really represents the culmination of a process of drafting fisheries agreements with third countries that the Commission and Parliament have been working on for some time now .
administrative procedures and formalities must be reduced to a minimum .
again , on the one hand , the problem is that the secretive and complex system adopted by the Council does not facilitate external scrutiny , which therefore negates any resemblance of accountability and therefore democracy .
I should like to end by recalling that last month in this House we approved a report by Mr Pirker on the problem of the accelerating growth in the production of and trade in synthetic drugs , which approved extending the ban to substances which at the moment are not scheduled .
I voted in favour of this report and also the two following reports concerning the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund .
on the other hand , we support the other amendments regarding audits and the management of the business development centre .
I believe that the euro will provide a positive boost to competition . It will ensure transparency in pricing ; it will ensure exchange rate and interest rate stability ; it will stifle currency speculation and will stimulate growth in employment .
it gets even worse when prominent politicians maintain close ties with extremist groups .
I recently had a conversation with the federal authorities of the United States , where no fewer than 48 000 people are engaged in monitoring air transport safety under a single federal umbrella .
in my opinion , it is impossible to like either globalisation or floods , let alone put up with them .
it is easier to establish connections between national systems.4.The use of private operators will deprive the people of their constitutional protection for telephone privacy which is a central civil and democratic right.- on the Argyros report ( A4-0213 / 97 )
I am implementing this mandate with the clear objective of having the decision to establish the EAS adopted as soon as possible after the entry into force of the Treaty .
Madam President , I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur , Mr Olsson , on his excellent work in compiling this report .
we can see , then , that there is a broad consensus in the international community that these conditions must be fulfilled , and it is one that this House has repeatedly underlined .
I think we all agree that we need to fight fraud , but let us not crack down on legal transfers of money .
when we looked at the parent directive , I was all for having financial services included at any cost , but now I think that this has to be done in a proper manner .
its scope was too broad for our liking , the drive to deregulate too strong , the devolution of powers to the Member States was not sufficiently respected and the proposal was ambiguous in too many places .
litigation systems also need improving .
in advising whether this should be done , the Scientific Steering Committee examined the available evidence from Member States and came to the conclusion that it was appropriate to remove the vertebral column in circumstances where Member States did not have a substantially BSE-free regime or did not have control measures in place which would be equivalent to very low BSE-incidence .
secondly , it would not be appropriate to go beyond such provisions with a looser - or indeed unconditional - system of prior authorisation , legally or de facto generalised in all Member States .
Mr President , today , you must forget who voted for you and who voted against you .
I would remind the House that two years ago the European Parliament almost unanimously supported the idea of reallocating quotas unused by the old Member States to the new Member States .
&quot; good administration &quot; is the opposite of &quot; maladministration &quot; .
. the report drawn up by Mr Lage addresses the important question of the credibility of scientific opinions used in fisheries management , given the frequent differences of opinion between scientists and fishermen regarding the current state of fisheries resources .
the architects directive as a whole has proved itself in practice , but if more traditional forms of education combined with long periods of practical experience are to be put on a par with more recent qualifications , then that should be made clear again here .
these considerations call forth the question of what resources to invest to mitigate the socio-economic consequences of this reform .
the time really has come to turn words into action .
I also note , however , a disparity in treatment ; there is a lack of homogeneity between one bracket and another ; in many cases the reference parameters do not justify the difference in the number of seats between one country and another .
there are a number of ways in which competition policy is important in driving this agenda forward .
the fight against terrorism is still a priority for the EU , and productive cooperation with the US , which includes activities such as exchanging data and information , is an important condition for averting terrorist attacks in future .
I was proud to be Vice-Chair of the European Parliament &apos;s Enquiry on Extraordinary Rendition and I share the outrage others have expressed on the complete silence of the Council in the face of our findings that many Member States were complicit in massive human rights abuses , of abduction and torture .
however , the Commission would like to assure the House that when the data is available it will not hesitate to act .
I therefore call for regular meetings of the Ministers for Employment and Social Affairs in the G20 .
nothing except oppression , intimidation and blatant denial of their human rights in the nine or ten months since that customs union was passed .
I also believe that the information desk should not , and cannot , act in the role of advocate , for then it would be responsible for the advice given .
I wonder whether the Turks realise that entering the EU will fundamentally undermine their ability to resist militant Islam .
they would have significantly less difficulty in collecting one million signatures .
we hope for the support of the Parliament in these political discussions and later in negotiations with the Council .
despite all the political differences between the various groups , our work was characterised by a struggle to find joint European solutions .
there is a danger of Amendments Nos 31 and 41 reducing the chances of recycling plastic , tyres and glass .
even if there is room for argument about whether the Commission was right or wrong , for our minister in his arrogance and our Tanaiste to pretend that they could not accept or understand that was dishonest and unfair .
after seven years as a Member , including on the Committee on Foreign Affairs , I am only too aware of Parliament &apos;s wholehearted commitment and real contributions to democracy building within the context of the EU &apos;s external relations .
I believe that credit ratings must serve the purpose of increasing information to the market in a manner that provides investors with a consistent assessment of credit risk across sectors and countries , and consider it important to enable users to better scrutinise CRAs .
however , in order to give this new approach some chance of success , the Commission should have opted for a less complicated proposal , a more simple and direct one , involving the NGOs from the outset , so that partnerships could develop in a balanced way .
if we delegate too much of the responsibility for the process of change to Russia , our efforts will be in vain .
thus it is acknowledging how important it is for the status of seafarers to be safeguarded within the framework of globalisation and for exploitative practices to be prevented .
this report should also accommodate the downside of a worldwide aviation market .
they must respect the rights and laws there ; but , conversely , the state that belongs to the Schengen area must also respect the rights of the citizen of the Union on its territory .
it may , therefore , come as something of a surprise to people that today I have to declare that a delay in the final stages of the enlargement process cannot be completely excluded .
so we must assert the right and duty of every worker to improve his professional qualifications throughout his career and , and that he must be able to spend part of his working time in training as well as in productive time or service delivery .
acceptance has been higher where the social partners have been tangibly involved in the development of employment programmes .
Mr President , you are a minister and enough of a politician to know that has something to do with party politics !
in this way , we will also be able to be in line with the Europe 2020 strategy , with intelligent , sustainable and inclusive growth .
the sanctions must not simply be tokenist .
many are looking towards Tampere with great hopes and are expecting considerable steps towards a Europe for the citizens .
texts of agreements forwarded by the Council : see Minutes
the European Council will not , over the coming weeks , be taking any decisions about the most recent reports by the Commission , but they will be discussed and presented .
the Commission has changed its line , but I fear this has come too late .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - Madam President , it has always been my contention that , far from encouraging competition , the EU in its drive for the mythical &apos; level playing field &apos; wants to stamp it out altogether .
the European Union continues to monitor on a daily basis , through its delegation in Beijing and its bilateral embassies , the situation with respect to Mr Liu Xiaobo , Nobel Peace Prize winner , his wife Liu Xia , as well as their friends and lawyers .
it can therefore be considered a suitable basis for future participating Member States , although some technical adaptations are needed .
Mr President , depressing - that is the word that best describes the situation in the European Union last week , with Member States showing a complete lack of mutual respect , and a growing gap between old allies .
however , it is an agreement that is based on the goodwill of the institutions and it has no regulatory value .
I also believe Russia must be encouraged to join the Energy Charter to prevent it from stopping third countries using its pipelines .
Europe must go to Seattle with a concept of globalisation that is opposed to that of a unilateral world dominated by just one power .
I would advise each and everyone of us to get away from this strange &apos; post-Nice &apos; concept .
until now , there has been a lot of very good legislation with very clear consequences , but it has been done without a strategy .
such is the case with Galileo , which has gone from a EUR 7.7 billion budget to a EUR 22.6 billion budget .
clearly several factors have influenced the outbreak of violence and massacre : a decade-old and badly implemented policy of trans-migration , genuine poverty in some parts of the area , misadministration and provocateurs who , for reasons we may only speculate about , create the violence .
we know that the higher one &apos;s education is , the lower the chances of losing a job .
the most positive aspects are the value attributed to the potential of the European territory and to its diversity , and also the three key concepts for more balanced and harmonious development in each region : reduction of the negative effects associated with differences in density ; connection between territories in order to overcome distance ; and cooperation in order to overcome divisions .
it is unreasonable to make such great demands of them if we are not prepared to ensure fair trade .
the decision on this crucial issue in the debate has been postponed for six years .
the point here is that , as far as the continuing application of the Schengen Agreement is concerned , the Council has only updated the European Parliament once , meaning that Parliament is unaware of issues which impinge directly on the free and unimpeded movement of citizens or how the Union &apos;s borders are controlled .
the main reason I cannot endorse this report is much more fundamental , however . Social policy and everything that can be subsumed under the heading &apos; social security &apos; is an outstanding example of a domain of the Member States , and sometimes of their federal states - not of the European Union .
we must be clear about this .
the discrimination that takes place against the Roma in various EU countries is common knowledge .
to all effects , therefore , in the absence of an autonomous budget , the Agency is de facto integrated in the Commission .
one such is the principle that no one should be detained without being accused of an offence .
in writing . - I agree with this report that an EU strategy to promote strong and skilled human resources with a strong creative potential and active involvement in innovation and development , new and innovative technologies / processes / solutions which generate added value , R &amp; D geared to the needs of sustainable development , an efficient supply chain for the production of high quality goods and services , more efficiently organised production and management systems , overall greater resources efficiency that leads to a reduced carbon footprint , cost-efficient and sustainable modes of transport , smart and efficient logistics and high quality infrastructure , a consolidated and fully operational single internal market , and a level playing field in trade relations with third countries , is the only means of increasing the sustainability and competitiveness of European industry and thus maintaining its global leadership .
the manipulation of gametes or embryos is also unacceptable on ethical grounds .
in expressing its opinion on the annual reports of the Commission relating to the application of Community law , Parliament has recognized the progress made in this area as well , but it has expressed wishes , of which the Commission has taken careful note , particularly as regards speeding up the infringement procedures : I can tell you that the Commission will be very willing to agree to make additional efforts to shorten the time taken for the transmission of these communications to the Committee on Petitions .
we certainly agree that reconciling these different perspectives is no easy task .
secondly , there is an urgent need to review the relationship between monetary policy and its impact on the real economy , families , investment and employment .
I think Russia needs membership of the WTO to modernise its economy , and with this President I am sure that is possible , as it was also possible with President Putin , who , himself , supported this issue .
from the enterprises &apos; point of view , if we are trying to revive the internal market , who can object to the idea of putting it into practice in the area of concessions ?
in paragraph 10 the Member States in general are called upon to reduce the total tax burden for individuals by transferring taxation from work in the direction of consumption in areas like the environment and energy .
the present proposal also lists the operational instruments upon which it is based , such as the minimum price of potatoes , the compensation payments to farmers , and the special premiums to industry . There are three reasons for paying industry : because of the structural disadvantages associated with starch manufacture ; because of the limited value of by-products ; and because of the seasonal nature of production .
while I want to see further reform of CAP I accept the Rapporteur &apos;s argument that this should not be by the &quot; back door &quot; .
the pact must also remain open to other Member States which might wish to take part in it and that are not members of the euro area .
as the text does not specifically mention natural sweet wines , I , along with several other Members , tabled Amendment No 274 in order to refer to them expressly , which is essential if we are to adhere to our common aim of respecting the diversity of the &apos; terroirs &apos; which give European wines their quality and individuality .
the question of liability cannot be dealt with in isolation .
the RoHS Directive belongs to those legislative acts which place the environment and sustainable development on the same footing as the uninterrupted movement of goods .
according to the information provided by NGO activists working for the protection of these emigrants , incredible sums were requested , reaching up to USD 8 000 for the release of each person .
therefore , a new institutional settlement should have been reached by the time the next new Member State is likely to be ready to join our Union .
the issue has stalled there .
is it not true to say that there are still certain prejudices in our society which militate against a person or a sex from the outset ?
let us use the substantial amounts we have at our disposal for the coming year , coupled with our effort , in a focused way .
we have dealt with several reports - the Mombaur report , the report on energy policy by Wim van Velzen , the two Rothe reports on the Green Paper and the White Paper .
we believe that measures such as drawing up a common asylum policy and establishing EURODAC - which would cause asylum seekers to be viewed with suspicion - would not further the fight against racism and xenophobia .
I greatly respect your pragmatism , your realism and understanding of the difficulty and the complicated calculations that you have outlined to us here .
Mr President , I propose that Parliament should confirm Mr Lukas Papademos &apos;s appointment as Vice-President of the European Central Bank , in accordance with the committee &apos;s unanimous vote .
it is enrichening to be able , as a Finn , to read the newspapers of the whole of Scandinavia , which is what we can now do thanks to the Swedish teaching we have in Finland .
nine years ago a border fence came down in Hungary , a wall came down in Berlin , yearned for by some , feared by others : the revolution had arrived .
I voted for this report as did most Labour MEPs because I feel that in this highly charged and controversial area , the rapporteur has achieved in her resolution a good , balanced approach .
was it not Germany , formerly the world &apos;s highest exporter , that years ago separated wage increases from productivity , thus resulting in social dumping ?
three days before the election , I had a meeting with representatives of human-rights organisations in Moscow .
you should therefore also shoulder your responsibility in this respect , and not merely look at the figures , but also at whether the policies are correct , which , in the field of structural policy , they are .
well , let us wait and find out , but , anyhow , it gives an opportunity to be more happy , for enjoying culture is , in most cases , enjoying happiness , so to speak .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioners , the successful development of the information society is the greatest challenge facing European businesses today .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Committee on Budgets has for some years been closely following the Commission &apos;s public relations , and I think that it has succeeded , by means of various instruments that budgetary law , thank God , puts at our disposal , in making a distinct improvement in the information policy of the Commission and of all the European institutions .
this would also be a development for Europe &apos;s Atlantic frontier and would establish another bridge between Europe and Africa .
Madam President , Commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , the Hungarian Presidency attaches great importance to the issue of Roma integration and is grateful for the active support of the European Parliament in this matter .
in addition , Mr President , do not tell us that the principle of direct payments to agriculture is fair , because it is an unjust principle and it must be reformed .
harmonization eliminates restrictions , and that is what this directive is designed to achieve .
we are also aware of a study that has just been published by the Russian Government on the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol .
it should also be noted that measures have already been adopted in other sectors , such as agriculture , to help them cope with this price rise .
I should also like to thank Parliament generally for its support and its sympathy for this project , without which we would not have made as much progress as we have .
this is certainly true for countries using a different penal system , such as the United States of America , where prisoners of war are locked up without any rights in camps that do not fall within the scope of American law and where the International Criminal Court is not recognised .
on this point , as on others , I wish to challenge the perception , and indeed the suspicion fed by ignorance , that the present Commission sees itself as the engine of a neo-liberal Europe .
together with the rapporteur and our colleagues in this Parliament , we will see to it that their understanding continues to improve .
as I have heard some speakers say this morning , Parliament has very much focused Directive 18 , or the general directive on contracts , on environmental issues , the updated system of electronic contracts , the social sphere and the issue of thresholds , and I therefore believe that we have legislation that is without doubt exceptional , but that does not actually concern this morning &apos;s subject matter .
patients with rare diseases do not only live in the EU ; besides we do not want the Commission to have powers in this area too .
we have here Security Council Resolution 1860 and we must comply with its provisions .
if it does not find anything , then it is important to take a step forward , in the light of the fact that Croatia has been cooperating with the tribunal for years and , therefore , has , to a large extent , met the conditions .
Mr President , this will certainly not be remembered as an exhilarating chapter in Parliament &apos;s history .
our proposals are therefore fully consistent with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality .
furthermore , the Member States are completely free to organise , each for their own part , the participation of the regions in their decision-making processes .
raw materials and oil on the global market are paid in dollars and the favourable exchange rate , in any case up to the referenda in France and the Netherlands , has resulted in relatively low fuel and food prices for European consumers .
when a criminal has caused injury to someone , compensation should not involve the State . No-one cares about the State , in the same way as no-one cares about prisoners .
however , I understand that the discussions between Member States at this stage focus mainly on airline ticket levies .
we have made our criticism about the lack of progress of the CFSP quite clear in recent years and , particularly , our dissatisfaction at the provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty in this respect .
it will improve the social acceptance of temporary agency work and will make it more attractive .
the Commission is also looking at ways and means to take concrete action against illegal logging , while extending assistance to the Burmese population , especially on health and education , via international organisations .
I would also like to say something about energy security .
Mr President , I believe Mr Bangemann has been honest with us this evening , and we should be honest too .
is there a Member who wishes to speak in favour of the request ?
with enormous respect to the President-in-Office , I have to say that answer was very inadequate , because all he did was repeat the European Court of Justice ruling , of which I am fully aware .
the EGF was set up in 2006 to provide practical support to workers made redundant either for reasons associated with the relocation of their companies or , following the 2009 amendment , on account of the economic crisis , in order to assist their reintegration into the labour market .
I therefore hope that we get to tackle some of the real problems .
we can all support the commitment to remove obstacles to access for people with disabilities and the commitment to non-discrimination and equal opportunities .
therefore , this directive must be generally welcomed .
and we must say as much , loud and clear , to the people of central Europe .
that is her right .
this is thus a small step towards harmonising the conditions for the railways and the roads .
we also think it is a step in the right direction that individual Member States should in special cases be able to require that fuels may only be marketed if they conform to more stringent environmental specifications than those laid down in the directive .
we always talk about women in the middle of the night , and one day we could do so in daylight , Mr President .
the draft resolution being discussed today covers a wide range of issues and , in its response to the resolution , the Commission will provide additional explanations which would be very difficult to provide today , mainly through lack of time .
this , too , is something which Mrs Maij-Weggen &apos; s otherwise quite excellent report does nothing about .
thus , we need to harmonise not only a document – it is not just a question of switching from a paper licence to a plastic one – but also people ’ s performance at the wheel .
the work done by the EMPA over the last three years has paved the way for an ever more constructive political future , but the Middle East conflict remains the number one problem .
the proposal before us is the first implementation of Article 13 . It concerns equal treatment irrespective of the colour of people &apos; s skin or their ethnic origin .
in this regard , I would like to point out that in 1999 the Council gave its opinion on the need to establish maximum requirements and guarantees in relation to nuclear installations within the European Union .
 
by defining harmonized criteria we also want to establish for the first time a guarantee of the financial efficiency of the providers of the reserved services too .
that is the only way that they can be taken forward sustainably and which will enable us , furthermore , to retain credibility as guardians of human rights both in Europe and further afield .
I really think it is irresponsible of the EU to push something through without a proper study being carried out and , as Mr Miller said , any studies done to date have been by vested interests on both sides .
ex-Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has been released on humanitarian grounds .
Mr President , the report by Mrs García Arias must be seen in an overall context , like the report by Mrs Marinucci , which we have already voted on today .
let the economy and market forces get on with it .
in the Commission &apos;s proposal there is no provision for any clear mechanism , which would ensure that passengers would not suffer from the effects of bankruptcy of airlines ; for example , not getting compensation for cancelled flights or being abandoned to their fate at overseas destinations .
. I take due note of the point made by the honourable Member .
for the first time now , these guidelines do not stress that principle which , in my opinion , was one of the causes - perhaps the main one - of so many negative developments .
further contact may therefore be needed with our closest allies and the United States in this case in particular .
as rapporteur I am in any case against this .
the European Union must strive to improve cooperation and coordination between Member States in monitoring diseases .
the famous step-by-step policy .
terror that day struck at the heart of the global financial system .
there should have been a debate about a real charter of social rights and freedoms , rather than about ratifying a cut-price charter of fundamental freedoms .
I would ask all of the Members to appreciate that the interpreters are due to finish work at twelve .
Mr President , Secretary-General of the Council , the Council is without doubt the institution most in need of reform .
I believe that this would represent an economic programme through which the Council could show , as one - as this would have to be decided unanimously - how consumption-based vehicle taxes could be brought on-line .
you cannot build a beautiful house with different-shaped bricks .
lastly , I note the concern expressed by several of you , particularly Mr Schmidt and Mrs Randzio-Plath , regarding the support given to small- and medium-sized businesses .
it is true that there are problems in Europe , and it is true that they are serious problems , but we must confront them and be able to find a solution .
the Committee also suggests calling on the Commission to propose a &apos; procedural code &apos; for the infringement procedure based on the new legal basis provided by Article 298 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to strengthen citizens rights and transparency .
I call again on the European authorities to redouble their efforts so that she is freed and that she can gain asylum or freedom in her own country , and to ensure that the state-sponsored murder of women and other human rights violations are ended in Iran .
we have , in fact , attempted to work , albeit holding different political points of view , in a direction that I believe is necessary to support a thoroughgoing reform of the common agricultural policy .
there are roadblocks and demonstrations by farmers throughout the region .
I would ask the Commissioner , therefore , to announce that this immediate aid will be provided .
it would have been fairer to Portugal if the rapporteur had recognised the effort and the measures that the Portuguese Government has already taken , which have been praised by both the Commission and the Council .
resale rights are particularly important in relation to artists in the field of the plastic arts , who are the least protected of creative artists in this matter owing to the unique and un-reproducible nature of their works .
in all the contacts the Commission has had recently with the Azeri authorities , we have strongly insisted on respect for fundamental freedoms , including , of course , freedom of expression and the possibility for political parties to hold public rallies without undue restrictions and to access mass media .
whatever the value of this argument , there is no doubt that the significant contribution from the United States to peacekeeping cannot be ignored .
this is very important for the achievement of our common ideal - the ideal of a united Europe .
the consumer could be misled , because two meats that were different in age , taste and quality could bear the same description and the same labelling .
the second point I would like to make is that the Commission does not wish to impose the levelling of national tax systems or social security systems .
no one wishes to see that .
the next item is Question Time ( B5-0163 / 2001 ) .
( applause )
Mr President , I thank the rapporteur for her total involvement and commitment to this report .
after all , if capital investment in development is neglected , Russia could find itself suddenly unable to meet its commitments .
ladies and gentlemen , trade can be the basis for lasting and fair development .
( HU ) As chairman of the EU-Croatia Joint Parliamentary Committee , I wish to point out that Croatia is considered a model to be followed by all neighbouring western Balkan states that have also set their eyes on joining the EU .
so , to answer the honourable Member again , I want us to manage much better what we are already charged with doing .
nevertheless , results are poor as , according to research , only half of EU citizens are familiar with holding a conversation in any foreign language .
we still , of course , await the outcome of the Copenhagen Summit , but I am convinced that Slovakia will be capable of bringing the negotiations to a successful end .
we will not judge Commissioners on the basis of the national preferences of one or other party or group inside this Chamber .
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned .
for me this raises the question : what is it that we want ?
2 . Situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo and rape as a war crime ( vote )
health services are services like no other .
this is relevant to the Lehne report given that , especially in relation to Amendment No 2 , it may well be asked to what extent the &apos; duty of supervision or approval &apos; to be imposed by Member States in turn requires a European framework system .
opening of the sitting
the fact that the Member States do not want this because the Commission and Parliament could then possibly get involved is , in my opinion , a mistake .
this clause must be introduced in its current form and without the slightest restriction into the first pillar , notwithstanding the recitals of the Schengen Protocol , which , absurdly , seem to state the contrary .
we welcome the fact that the report has included some very important things , such as waste reduction plans .
in this way we were able to reduce the future costs of renting .
they are operating legally , in international waters , and controlled by the competent authorities .
it is time for the EU to make an active contribution to establishing the right conditions for a political solution to the war in Kosovo .
the USA must instead be reminded that &apos; international law does not belong in the dustbin , torture is an instrument that does not yield credible results ; and democracy cannot and must not be exported through the use of bayonets . &apos;
all our proposals include special and differential treatment which , in the case of the least-developed countries and the most vulnerable countries , basically means that they will not be requested to make any liberalising effort in this round .
the battle for social and environmental criteria , which was won mainly thanks to the proposal of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , proves that the European Parliament still basically supports the European social model and sustainable development , which is the only way to make Europe competitive in a global environment .
flexibility is needed essentially because we are talking about two different kinds of aid .
however , all of these demands were rejected by the Committee .
your Presidency sums up the whole EU project : an exercise in political dishonesty , where the views of ordinary people count for very little .
Madam President , I concur with my colleague , Mr Ford , that of course if we only sat in Brussels , we would not be here debating this building .
and it will be some time before they do .
we cannot allow our market , all that we have accomplished in this area in Europe , to be dominated by one firm .
( the sitting was suspended at 1 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
in fact , in order to bring about a far-ranging change in the unfair shareout of support which is currently given it is vital that we introduce preferential aids to those on lower incomes and to family farms while limiting or even preventing aid which at present is given to farmers on higher incomes at set limits .
apparently some 450,000 jobs are lost in the EU every year as a result .
that is why I keep returning to the idea of a plan of values , and solidarity is certainly a value that can unite us .
religious freedom is the human right most commonly infringed with impunity in the contemporary world .
many of the existing environmental problems are the result of secrecy .
therefore I especially welcome Parliament &apos;s initiative in taking up this issue now .
when I raided my daughter &apos;s toy box three weeks ago and pulled out one thing and another , I asked some neighbours along my street what they thought about this when they bought toys .
I also know that there are still some very sensitive issues in the report which concern individual Member States .
the oral amendment suggested to the Socialist amendment is on the order paper and I hereby propose it on behalf of our group .
the Member States , however , were never able to agree on how to transfer this special instrument , which has been in place since 1958 , to the budget .
on 1 October last year , Mumia Abu-Jamal &apos;s lawyers submitted an appeal for the case to be retried by the Supreme Court of the State of Pennsylvania .
visa applications will be processed in 10 days , or in three days for some categories , or less in cases of emergencies .
in Germany and Austria a great number of businesses have taken part in it , whereas the uptake from businesses in other Member States has been very low .
but if we are not even enforcing the existing rules , how are we going to cope with even stricter ones ?
in the short-term , these obviously relate to the fiscal reforms which will improve the administration of taxes . In the medium-term they concern all matters related to improved public expenditure .
we request the Commission &apos;s assistance in this matter .
shipping is a global industry .
Finland ’ s own national parliament , the , is celebrating a special anniversary .
finally , good progress has been achieved in setting up EU social dialogue structures in sport .
what should become the most important instrument is being used only for 52 % , or 55 % , as the Commissioner stated a moment ago .
on the main report , the political group which I represent as coordinator supports it throughout - to such an extent that we wanted it to be kept , like Mrs Dührkop &apos;s , as short as possible .
I say that with deep regret .
clearly , there can be no possibility of military action to destroy nuclear plant in Korea .
I think it is very important for farmers right now that a clear signal be sent to them as to what is likely to happen , so that they will not be left to wild speculation , not knowing whether to buy or sell stock based on the historic model .
finally , two topics that are also very close to my heart .
for this purpose , an integrated policy for spinning should be implemented in the areas involved and in the textiles and clothing districts such as the Carpi region , where I come from .
the EU saves money all the time it does not enlarge .
I now have three supplementary questions before me .
meanwhile there is in this resolution , even a Section No. 5 which condemns outside intervention !
you are not happy with the studies that were carried out because the results do not match your particular vision , but there is not much I can do about that .
what is successful is the fact that we have a new principle for chemical substances .
are there any projects devoted to women immigrants ?
on the contrary , we have only a few trade agreements , there is a risk of bilateralism and there is the possibility that the Doha Development Round will not be continued by the US .
in a joint resolution of the five largest groups in Parliament , we are calling for all these people to be released immediately and for the rule of law , freedom of expression and of the media to actually be ensured so that , as President Aliyev assured us years ago - in 2005 - &apos; No journalist is persecuted in Azerbaijan &apos; .
I urge the Council to move quickly and to revise the Dublin Convention .
within the European Union and the Commission to which you now belong , the conclusions of the G20 seem to be gospel .
I should like to take this opportunity to point out that placing too much emphasis on economic criteria is to be condemned .
for that reason we shall support Amendments Nos 1 , 2 , 25 and 27 .
there are two sources of chlorine in waste incineration plants : firstly vegetable , fruit and garden waste , which contains a large amount of chlorine too , and then there is PVC .
pursuant to this directive , and not later than 19 December 2011 and every three years thereafter , the Commission must prepare a report of the application of the directive and , if necessary , make further proposals for its adaptation , especially in respect of new technological developments .
all this should be understood under the premise that I mentioned at the beginning of my speech .
we would like to know a little more about where the Commission is pulling back so that it can concentrate on the things that really matter .
we believe that it is not possible to justify this to European taxpayers .
here - as is , indeed , stated in the recitals - it was not possible to do justice to the aim of this directive , that being to speed the process up .
the Commission will analyse this study in depth and will listen closely to the opinions of the interested parties .
improving the way we welcome visitors , who will be coming in increasing numbers , and improving access to documents are two measures that speak for themselves .
I would add , on this point , that the Commission has already tabled a number of proposals and made a number of recommendations which are , or have been , under consideration by Parliament .
I believe this is what Mr Hyland is concerned about . I do not believe that we are .
we all agree that this is a most welcome development .
tomorrow we celebrate the liberation .
these flags are used to bypass the union , tax , recruitment , safety and environmental regulations of the countries to which the vessels really belong .
we would also argue in favour of transparency and clarity in respect of the numbers of animals and types of tests carried out by research labs .
there is no mention at all of control over profiteering capital movements , which are a fundamentally destabilising factor especially for less developed countries , and which are an integral element of the rationale of easy , quick and maximum profit .
I believe that it offers hope to everybody who believes in basic research , with the creation of the European Research Council , and in the most advanced pioneering research , despite all of the risks it involves .
in the same spirit of acceptance and invitation , I would also like to encourage Mrs Pack and the Commissioner maybe to extend similar schemes to include other countries that are willing .
I should like to thank you for the resolution , and express the firm belief that the European Union should support the country in seeking a better future .
Mr President , I wanted to speak on the European Parliament &apos;s discharge and first of all to thank the rapporteur for the excellent work he has done , and the hard work he has done , along with many others .
the Commission is assuming that for reasons of subsidiarity the Member States will primarily have to provide the funding , but that the private sector is also likely to invest in it .
in the case of Portugal , the proposal presented at the last European Council in Florence to integrate the project for a motorway from Lisbon to Valladolid into the inter-modal links between Portugal and Spain seems to us far more in keeping with the philosophy approved by the European Parliament and will actually contribute to a more balanced development of this region .
we Moderates are therefore voting against the above report .
it is essential that we conclude this issue before the end of the British presidency , which is approaching fast .
we have two in Scotland .
the European Union &apos;s key objective in the area of asylum entails establishing a common area of protection and solidarity by 2012 based on a common asylum procedure .
biomass and biofuels are of massive global potential , yet the growth of this sector must at all times be managed sensitively .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs . - ( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , it is my task to present the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and for once , if I may say so , with pleasure .
for a number of years now , the EU &apos;s budget out-turn has been a large surplus .
Italy is the only country not to have implemented the European arrest warrant .
and in that you will be supported to the hilt !
subject : European-level action on combating Alzheimer &apos;s disease
I have consulted my colleagues who have been more involved in the negotiations and they are prepared to work 24 hours a day if need be in order to push it as far as possible and give the British presidency a chance .
firstly , at the Intergovernmental Conference itself , the Presidency tried to include the European Parliament to a much greater extent than was provided for in the Helsinki decisions .
this is included in the proposal .
we are indebted to the women of our villages , who have contributed incalculably and almost invisibly to the development of the countryside .
we express our active solidarity with the Palestinian people and call on the European Parliament to demand that the ΕU stop arming Israel and freeze the association agreement with it .
on the defence and military side there has been impressive progress in creating European capacities that the Union is already beginning to put to use .
this has been emphasised by the European Union Network for the Implementation and Enforcement of Environmental Law since 2003 , and it has made clear proposals for improvements .
on the other hand this represents a demand put forward years ago by the European Parliament and particularly by its Committees on Foreign Affairs and on Development and Cooperation .
I shall not hide the fact from Parliament - and never have done - that negotiations are currently giving some cause for concern .
the answer to the question as to what you intend doing to speed up the introduction of the European arrest warrant is ‘ nothing ’ . On 1 January next year , there will be no European arrest warrant .
whatever happens , it is essential that in promoting equal opportunities , we ensure that all women benefit , regardless of age .
I know work on this has already started , for example , the inventory to look at access regulation that exists .
in the committee vote I indicated that this situation could possibly be resolved by a Commission declaration clarifying the treatment of such evidence in the application of Commission penalties .
we have recognised that air navigation services are of general and security interest .
why ?
there is also traffic in fissile materials .
therefore it is essential to guarantee and simplify universal access to European cultural heritage and to ensure that it be promoted and preserved for generations to come .
we proposed that the opposite principle should be adopted , that documents should be public , although there might be some exceptions .
I would like to thank all my colleagues from the Parliamentary groups for the efforts they have made to present a common approach .
implementation of EMU ( continuation )
allow me to add a comment on the subject of ‘ one share , one vote ’ .
that being the case , Mr Mladenov &apos;s proposal is outstanding and deserves our support .
the latter means that more money will have to go to the EU for that EU embassy , but it also means that 27 times less money is spent in the 27 Member States .
the second message , endorsing the opinion of my colleague Mrs Trüpel , is that it is unacceptable for certain European countries to submit , and sometimes succumb , to pressure from the Chinese authorities aimed at preventing them from holding official meetings with important Chinese personalities , in some cases dissidents , or representatives such as the Dalai Lama , in return for assured trade relations with China .
generally important though I regard the Bank as being , we can see that the absence of transparency excludes the possibility of trust and democracy , in this House as much as in the EIB .
for instance , DDT and lindane have been banned in the EU for many years but their presence can still be detected in the blood of our citizens .
I believe that this would be almost impossible to obtain .
I also believe that the older Member States of the European Union - and I would like the Commission to take note of this - will do away with the nonsensical restrictions on the employment of citizens from the new Member States .
thank you for reminding us of that and for making that nice mention .
I have been concerned about the studies that have been recently published on the children of migrants .
whilst reference is made to the importance of the EEVC &apos;s research and development programme , we call for the quality of the four systematic tests in phase B to be further developed .
I am specifically responding to Mr Watson on this point , as he was the person who drew my attention to it : existing recreational craft may continue to operate provided that their breach of the requirements does not represent an obvious danger .
the EU &apos; s role is mainly one of political , logistical support , and diplomatic action to be undertaken .
if one looks at the report we can see that there have been and will be improvements to the system from the way the Commission reports to Parliament on its findings .
while we should not claim any competences where we do not have them , matters such as internal market rules , the fight against racism and cross-border fraud do indeed fall within the EU &apos;s remit .
in a law-abiding state which respects itself , recourse to the Ombudsman can really only be an additional method of ensuring the good conduct of the institutions .
these Swedes seem a bit wimpish , a bit hypochondriac and oversensitive .
in view of the fact that there has been no improvement in the human rights situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo , which is , in fact , worsening , and in view of the fact that systematic violations of human rights are being committed on a daily basis , specifically in terms of unlawful executions , abductions , sexual assaults and acts of torture , I think it is essential for me to vote in favour of this resolution carried by the European Parliament .
the words of the Dominican Lacordaire are apt here : &apos; Between the weak and the strong , between the rich and the poor , between the lord and the slave , it is freedom which oppresses and the law which sets free . &apos;
the regulation rightly states the priorities in reconstruction aid .
how to make sure that Community control mechanisms will be available ?
future cohesion policy , the pillar of solidarity of the European project and of social justice , must take into account the following priorities : firstly , reinforcing social cohesion and incorporating the challenges posed by the Europe 2020 Strategy ; secondly , providing for the needs and geographical characteristics of the regions , especially the most disadvantaged regions ; thirdly , maintaining a gradual approach to the collection of funds so that the regions do not abandon the objective of convergence , avoiding sudden changes in the receipt of aid ; and fourthly promoting an equitable system .
in the light of this it is difficult to come to terms with the fact that Europe is treating Russia as a democratic partner , forgetting that this is a country whose authorities not only countenance numerous violations of our principal ideas , but also openly mock them .
I also wanted to draw your attention to what happened during the hearing with Mervyn King and Andrea Enria , whose very determined action we applaud .
Nigeria must understand that its relationship with the civilised world will not remain the same if the sentence is carried out and I for one will advocate expulsion from the Commonwealth and an immediate programme of selective sanctions and travel bans on Nigeria &apos;s leaders .
the only point I wish to add is that an extremely important step forward was taken in London in terms of the financial capacity of these institutions , particularly the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) .
Mr President , it seems to me , as I finish , that this would be more advisable .
this is a very serious matter , which affects everything in these agreements .
consolidation of the biregional strategic partnership between the European Union and the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean , signed in 1999 , must be a priority on the European Union &apos;s foreign policy agenda .
a 15 % reduction in energy consumption could mean as much as a 1 % drop in electricity consumption and lower CO2 emissions throughout the Union .
I therefore call on the Commission to define the cases in which we can talk of a &apos; mass influx of displaced persons &apos; under the terms of Directive 2001 / 55 / EC on temporary protection , thereby setting precise , measurable criteria that can be regarded as permanent .
in the run-up to the Council of 22 January the South African leader of the negotiations , the trade minister Mr Erwin , sent a letter to Commissioner Pinheiro in which he actually categorically rejected any amendment of the compromise reached in Davos .
I believe that we must be aware of the fact that it is indeed possible that , in the coming weeks and years , this region will not experience political regimes that are both stable and inspired by freedom and moderation .
he will , of course , always work according to the basic principle of accountability to Parliament and to you , and at all times he will be acutely aware of his responsibility .
so have they been doing nothing ?
this draft regulation is a real step forward : let us continue in this direction .
firstly , credibility in the eyes of our own citizens .
can I say that I personally am persuaded of the importance of addressing fuel poverty : I think that block tariff reform could be a way to go .
it goes without saying that we will make our further preparations in consultation with Parliament .
at its meeting on 29 November 2004 , the Council adopted conclusions on renewable energies which highlighted the importance of making renewable energies more competitive by reducing production costs , among other things .
they are the little acorns from which some of the biggest oaks in the forest of jobs have grown .
it is indeed important that we now describe and regard SMEs as a cross-section , that we rethink support measures , that we give precedence to small enterprises in public tenders ( &apos; Think Small First &apos; ) and that we prevent public authorities from intervening in competition .
it seems to me particularly significant that agreement has been reached before the Barcelona Summit .
I can give an example for my country , Austria , namely that , in the last year , seizures have been down by more than 40 % and losses have been reduced by more than 50 % .
at European level , however , we need to target the data which will lead to a better cohesion policy and improved regional development , so that inequalities are eliminated and the gap between different social groups and different European regions is narrowed .
in practice , there is also an inability to promote crop rotation , because of the misconceived CAP pricing and subsidy system for agricultural produce .
I just want to stress that this Parliament has elected its new President at an extraordinary juncture .
this proposal would also involve information centres being set up so as to enable victims to identify appropriate claim representatives .
the annual report is a good moment to take stock and consider what is working well in the JPA and what could work better .
it is also especially important not to exclude long-term contracts but rather to ensure that these are considered when planning for stable energy supplies to Europe .
I wonder how the Commission actually intends to go about adopting new measures to achieve the goals it has set itself .
Commissioner , I would like to bring to your attention a particular wish which I heard while staying in Montenegro and speaking to its politicians there .
thank you , Mr Blokland .
the strength of the euro is another subject that gives rise to debate .
OLAF has a clear strategy .
States must play a central role and develop cooperation to make it possible to create new knowledge , making it available to society as a whole .
it will be fascinating to see whether or not this new instrument for monitoring subsidiarity is effective .
it would be greatly to the credit of the Commission , and indeed also of this House , if we were once and for all to admit this and make the right choices .
strict monitoring of the meeting of such standards ought to be a matter of course in all the EIB &apos;s financial operations .
detainees were refused the opportunity to call their witnesses and to meet in proper conditions and on a regular basis with their legal representatives .
this has to be stated .
I feel that this is the message that has reached us here in Europe this year , from both Porto Alegre and Davos .
all necessary measures must therefore be taken to eliminate these adverse effects and to harmonize the cohesion policies with the goal of environmental conservation .
Mrs Haug &apos;s report does not avoid this logic ; it enlists the measures put forward in the short term solely to achieve the same objective , that is , to reduce the differences in contributions for the financing of Community expenditure , while in the medium and long term , it resorts to general recommendations .
as mentioned in the EP resolution , efforts should include support to producer efforts in diversification , organisational strengthening and tapping into niche markets .
the reason for this was the Life projects , which make up half this budget , and which could not be spent in 2000 because the legal basis was not determined in conciliation until July 2000 .
Tampere proved that the Union has the political will to carve out joint policies on issues which indirectly affect our daily lives , policies which will , for example , make citizens feel more secure through effectively stepping up the fight against organised crime , particularly in the area of drug trafficking , money laundering and the trafficking of human beings through judicial cooperation and mutual recognition of judgements .
a single point of contact will be established for allocating capacity within the timetable already approved .
but it is clear that with the experience we have gained from America we can perhaps present an improved proposal now .
we agree with the assumption underlying the report that , as a result of globalisation , economic reforms will be required in order to maintain European competitiveness .
the most important thing is that the meetings are held and that the things which need to be discussed are discussed and that the decisions that need be made are made .
habits set in .
I expect a politically correct response to the fact that tens of millions of people will die from hunger this year , and a further hundred million will slide deeper into poverty .
we should not fall behind , and we are proposing simple EU rules on orphan book works and also books which are out of print .
to cite one example : the role of the army .
it is encouraging and elevating to feel that there is one commemorative event with which everyone can identify .
the euro must operate for the good of all the Member States within the euro area and all the people therein .
but we want to state our own fundamental attitude to fishery agreements of this type .
unless we succeed in doing that , we shall constantly find ourselves in this kind of rushed situation , and that is a bad thing .
it covers not only fishing vessels , but also vessels used for fishing related activities , such as transport vessels which may be used to carry fisheries products .
Mr President , it may sometimes be necessary to take more time to say less .
Mr President , this protest from the left is unacceptable .
it props up an industry that is not sustainable either economically - otherwise it would not need subsidies - or environmentally .
 
this must be taken into account in the debate .
the next item is the statements on measures to be taken to free Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo .
Mr President , we have not yet given up on the goal of a common European label , at least that is my interpretation of the common position .
then I have a few comments to make on the essential requirements .
the US Department of Agriculture has not recognized some Member States as free of epidemics like swine fever or Newcastle disease , although these diseases have not occurred in these Member States for a long time .
will you look at that issue as well ?
let us hope that this does not mean a change in position on its part and that it remains clearly understood that the future coins will have one national side .
the amendments do not propose preventing pharmaceutical companies from producing information about their medicines for the general public .
the previous regulation , drafted nine years ago , was hopelessly behind the times , and it was necessary to bring it up to date .
likewise , I wish to thank the second budget rapporteur , Kathalijne Buitenweg , and also , in particular , the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets , Terrence Wynn , for his skilful and constructive leadership of the Committee .
signature of acts adopted under codecision : see Minutes
the public right across the Union no longer supports the currency , and the battle for Spain has not even begun .
we shall support this proposal which we believe must be supplemented by an approach that enables cross-funding , without which adjustments are not possible , and that threatens , over the long term , the functioning of general interest services .
some 15 or 20 years ago in the Netherlands , I worked together with a Christian-Democrat member of government , Mrs Jeltien Kraaieveld , who was also involved in this anti-discrimination legislation in the field of discrimination based on sex .
that is something that you and your Commissioners will have to earn : every day , every month , brick by brick , in this stronger , closer European Union .
finally , I do not wish to express my thanks .
the first is in line with the Commission &apos;s Green Paper on obstacles to transnational mobility in the areas of education , training and research .
it was Jacques Delors who proposed the European Training Cheque , and I urge your House to draw on it !
if we can take away this lesson , it is certain that the future of the euro area will be a better one .
Mr President , President Santer , you are full of praise for the new ethics advisory group in the way that a good father speaks well of his children , even if they have failed .
I will , of course , make sure that Mr Potočnik gets a full account of it .
the Member States themselves have competence for their own healthcare systems , and therefore accessibility and quality varies somewhat .
I do not agree with Mr Wurtz that the Barcelona Process is dead .
the European Union has forged a reputation for itself in the aeronautical and space industry .
interacting with the United States on climate change , for sustainable energy and for the global market , is a good start to the talks .
I can cite some successful examples of this approach from my own part of Germany , from Thuringia , which is an Objective 1 area .
our resolution therefore calls for an end to this situation .
you are right to say that we need to save taxpayers &apos; money and that we must work towards being based in one place . However , the refuge of parliamentarianism , Mr Hannan , is here in Strasbourg .
( Parliament adopted the motion .
thank you very much , Commissioner .
the cooperation needed in this respect must be better planned .
the Commission appears to have confirmed that it wants these guidelines to block , rather than facilitate , the application of those safeguard measures , as Commissioner Ferrero Waldner made clear in the debate in this House .
as from next year , the Union will be represented by 27 commissioners and 785 MEPs : this is clearly an inflationist process , which disrupts the running of our institutions .
my advice is to not accept this .
Mr President , a few weeks ago , in Brussels , we were expressing our outrage against the crimes perpetrated against children in one of our Member States .
our task is one of persuasion .
decision-makers , authorities , local governments , farmers , NGOs and citizens need proper information regarding pesticide use in order to reduce and prevent the negative impacts of pesticide use .
in addition , Turkey has made some progress as a constitutional state , but not enough by a long chalk .
really , 15 ministers of agriculture should be present at these decisive debates , not just one who has to act as the whipping boy for the rest .
the idea of responsible technological progress , moreover , is one of the main axes of the action plan on issues involving science and society which the Commission will shortly be announcing .
when that ship docks in the EU , if even a small trace of GM soya is found , even if that soya has been licensed in the EU , the whole cargo can be turned away .
we have received several requests for the debates on breaches of human rights .
the Slovenes belong to Europe , they are a deeply European people .
Andrei Sakharov also left us the advice that his country needs understanding and pressure - emphatic pressure .
I belong to a generation that vowed that , after the Holocaust , there would never again be anything like it .
it is therefore crucial to look more closely at this sensitive field and to invest in it more appropriately .
we understand that technological changes will have major financial implications , and that therefore the regions should also be able to use the structural funds in order to finance the acquisition of advanced technological installations , create jobs in innovative fields and rehabilitate urban areas freed up by the transfer of port facilities .
I would say to Commissioner Fischler that , when the College meets next Wednesday , please come forward more rapidly with a proposal to establish a European Food Agency because in my view , if that had been in place today , this dispute would never have arisen .
it is not a question of &apos; if there is a shortage of supply &apos; .
agreement on security and safety rules must be paramount , to enable this issue to be resolved , since a solution to this problem would invalidate every other argument on insecurity attributable to the foreign ownership of companies within the United States , or on insecurity attributable to the opening-up of the internal market .
with regard to Schengen , without wishing to trespass on the territory of the Council , or more precisely the incorporation of the Schengen acquis into the Community framework , I would like to stress , on the topical subject of restoring border controls , that the Commission wishes to reiterate its willingness to ensure greater control of the application of Article 2 ( 2 ) of the Schengen Convention in order to reinforce its authority .
how many times following a tragic incident on the motorways of Europe has the accident proven to be due to human error ?
we really wonder whether the work this body does justifies its running costs .
to this end , the European Council called on the Council of Ministers to speed up its work and asked it to approve the provisions on family reunification by July 2003 .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
Howitt report ( A4-0214 / 98 )
in this respect , European society owes a debt of gratitude to all those workers and professionals who have contributed to the consumers and families having been able to enter the era of the euro so easily .
furthermore , I note with interest the idea for a Parliamentary Group to be set up to oversee the coherence and consistency between global economic , social and environmental policies and to provide a holistic overview of the most important international organisations .
I most certainly do not blame you for this situation , Mr President .
it should live from the contributions that the nation states vote for and control on an annual basis .
we feel sure that the third report will provide appropriate and fair solutions .
you correctly state Rule 114 .
we can see this more especially in the road transport sector , with serious consequences for the health of workers and for road safety .
I want the Member States , and indeed the presidency , today during our debate , to commit to taking action , not just to debate the issues we have known about for many years .
( FR ) Madam President , as our fellow Members have said repeatedly this morning , the problem of financing the developing countries &apos; fight against global warming may cause the Copenhagen Summit to fail , when we were all hoping it would be a success .
- Report : Luisa Morgantini
as you know , there have been discussions within the Council over the precise list of projects to be supported by the Community and how they should be funded .
the Court , responding to the wishes of the discharge authority , has continued to follow up the observations in previous Annual and Special Reports .
are they sufficiently advanced at present to enable us to replace what we extract from nuclear sources ?
in terms of proportion , one can certainly compare atrocities against civilians in Kosovo and in Chechnya , but it is obvious that our response to Russia will be different – as it indeed is .
( EL ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the European Finance Ministers have decided not to agree on a Europe-wide increase in wages to counter the rising cost of living .
culture , religion and tradition must not be used to justify acts of violence .
we are not supposed to open most of the suspended chapters anyhow as it will take some years to gather the benchmarks and closing a chapter is a formality - it means nothing once all the other work has been completed .
one of the possible ways of exposure is by inhaling particles into the lungs , but the resuspension process is very ineffective , and once the particles have settled after an impact , the view is that the risk of inhalation will be much reduced , compared with that in the initial phase .
I intend to bring these forward , especially since I understand this morning that the Council has decided to withdraw the regulations as presented and to present them in a new format , thereby delaying yet further the adoption of the regulations .
it is important to stress the scale of the economic relationship currently worth USD 2 billion a day , but where there is competition there will inevitably be some areas of conflict and friction , and part of the nature of the relationship is to try and contain that friction .
I also believe that more important than ascertaining the type of products used in the manufacture of textile products is to assess whether these are in compliance with competition rules and respect for workers &apos; dignity and rights , as cases where these are violated are on the increase .
as soon as circumstances permit , I shall visit Israel , Palestine and Lebanon .
maybe the Commission should look at the levels of grant aid .
by fearfully concealing the glaring gaps in their budgets , Greece , Latvia and Hungary have shaken confidence in the euro .
the customs agreement between the EU and Turkey has been signed , but Turkey will still not allow Cypriot ships to call at Turkish ports .
we therefore consider it necessary to refrain from interference regarding decisions to be made by individual Member States on the use or non-use of any specific type of human cells or tissues .
I think it would be worth establishing European Union human rights observatories in each of the three continents , which would maintain relations with the NGOs and with the instruments of the United Nations , so that the annual reports carried out by Parliament , to the Commission and the Council , may have the effect of improving our interventions .
this is why Natura 2000 should be added to the Life + regulation as a separately funded activity ; also , it would be expedient in the case of Life + to direct most of the funding for projects through the Member States .
I think that these examples really show how , through our state aid reform process , we are making the rules more predictable and reducing the administrative burden of state aid notification , and that was what you were asking for in the interests of island regions and all other stakeholders .
where is the protection for the rights of citizens of Europe if - as Mrs Meissner has already stressed - entire States such as Cyprus , Luxembourg and Malta are excluded from this protection ?
it remains true , though , that they also harbour many fears , and we must take those fears seriously and allay them wherever we can .
all of this clearly depends to a very large extent on the financial perspective , but what we can say this evening is that if , thanks to Parliament and thanks to the Commission , the financial perspective is sufficient to cover Europe ’ s needs , Mr President , we will then be in a position to create these trans-European networks effectively , which will undoubtedly be a determining factor for the single market and for mobility in Europe .
I find that absolutely acceptable , but the point is not whether Mr Ribeiro e Castro was quoting correctly . The problem is whether what is being quoted is correct .
( IT ) Madam President , Mrs Ferrero-Waldner , Mr Gloser , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to summarise very quickly the sense of my amendment , which is backed by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe .
the European Commission has conducted missions and undertaken a series of consultations and studies .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I do not want my speech today to be a routine detailed listing of each and every one of the proposals set out in the legislative programme .
( PL ) Madam President , I should like to begin by thanking Mr Lehne , the rapporteur , for all the work he has undertaken on a matter which is of such vital importance to the future of European integration and the development of economic cooperation within the framework of the internal market .
it is , in any case , clear to me that this should involve only stem cell lines which have already been produced and which can be suspended in a culture in which they can proliferate .
the amendments tabled by the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance concerning anti-discrimination , minority rights and social rights have been adopted either wholly or in part .
I think that the next step should now be to send , as we decided , an official delegation from Parliament to the Palestinian territories and to Israel , and also , once there , to organise a visit to Europe by President Arafat .
but we are disappointed that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has shown itself unwilling to take one step more towards achieving still greater openness , hence my group has submitted a number of amendments to this end .
regarding the social chapter and your priorities , I think that a distinction needs to be made .
this issue of fingerprinting an ethnic group falls under the competence of the European Parliament and we should firmly decide that the EU countries be subordinated to the European legislation in this field .
the European Union is contributing to the UN Population Fund , which for its part assists the practice of forced abortion in developing countries .
at least last week Council renewed its targeted sanctions , but these are not being applied with any real vigour ; they are not hurting Mugabe &apos;s cronies .
Transdniestria does not need mentioning further ; we know about it and the present attitude of the government is not helping to solve the problem there .
and it needs to be said .
here too , you negotiated exceedingly well , for which I offer you our special thanks .
for most people , the answer is no doubt obvious .
Mr President , war is an evil , but in some cases it can be the lesser of two evils .
our concerns lie in a different direction , however .
Mr President , this House is the democratic heartbeat of the European Union , and therefore we always need to express ourselves very clearly and very strongly , sending a clear and very defined message of this total and permanent commitment that we have to the cause of human rights which , as we have heard in this House this evening , do not refer to nor are preached by one region or one continent , but are of a universal , worldwide nature , and we need to start setting an example of this in our own house .
I also want to stress that the former Prime Minister of the Slovak Republic , Mr Mikuláš Dzurinda , and other politicians who are worried about the negative impact the power plant would have on the environment and on the quality of life in Trebišov , and about its negative impact on the unique Tokay winegrowing region bordering Ukraine and Hungary , have lent their support to the actions of the citizens of Trebišov .
we must not abandon this country , which has so many friends in Europe .
I would be pleased to hear what you intend to do about this .
this is because it initially suggests that national contributions should end and then it proposes extending the GNP national contribution and making this the main resource of the Union &apos;s budget .
this means not merely checking funding applications but , where appropriate , also seeking out suitable partners or networks for collaboration .
if we extend a tried and tested programme , and we manage to avoid the usual problems inherent in getting a new programme off the ground , we can draw on the experience and know-how of Tempus , incorporating the improvements that have been made to it over time and which will no doubt encourage rapid diversification in the range of university studies available as well as cooperation between Euro-Mediterranean partners .
that is why it is so important that Parliament should again send Canada a strong signal at this point .
that report is available to colleagues .
I have heard rumours that all 15 Member States have rejected it in the Council .
Schengen is now an established asset of European civilization and as such should be protected and preserved .
together they have set the stage for a fruitful discussion today .
in any case , it was during the Belgian Presidency that the greatest deception so far , the greatest betrayal of European citizens since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , became a reality , namely , the introduction of the now permanent crisis mechanism .
I believe in the necessity for the Commission to be impartial and fair in the exercise of its duties .
and it seems that that is what will happen .
this is why there should be much more safety regarding the prescription of veterinary medicinal products .
Madam President , I have just realized that I have forgotten something , since I was in such a hurry .
is my salary a State secret ?
it is not doing so , despite the hopes placed in it .
overall , we are very satisfied with the result of the conciliation and feel that the rapporteur has done a good job .
Mr President , my group wanted to see our amendments incorporated to this report which would have increased the powers of Parliament over future budgets on trans-European Energy and Transport networks , though they were unsuccessful .
( Loud protests )
I find that the Cologne resolution to establish a Charter of Fundamental Rights is of unusually great significance .
therefore , we would like the Commission to look at this in more detail before bringing this in .
I asked myself , therefore , whether I should support this result or not .
. – Mr President , what I have to say also concerns the problem facing Polish forests mentioned by the previous speaker .
in order to implement these policies , the Commission will make use of the EUR 25 million from the thematic programme &apos; Investing in people &apos; to support initiatives in the following areas : child trafficking , children affected by armed conflicts , sexual and reproductive health , and rights of young people .
now , with the current majorities in Congress , the law is not even on the table - with the result that we must assume that things will be more difficult unless we succeed in taking some of these matters further with countries such as China , India or Brazil .
they are decided in advance by the political elite and governments of the Member States of the European Union .
however , difficult decisions remain for Parliament , such as that on funding for the Microfinance Facility - I hope Members will still regard that as a priority - on ensuring that we find the funding for Kozloduy in the next three years , and on finding funding for new priorities : priorities coming out of Copenhagen , priorities coming out of the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty and priorities coming out of the new 2020 strategy we will be discussing next year .
the misdiagnosis is this : it is true that in certain fishing areas stocks of cod are in a perilous state , but this cannot simply be attributed to overfishing : there are also many other factors that come into play here .
it is important to identify the skills and potential of our regions in the hi-tech sector .
in the British press , surprisingly , Parliament has been praised for coalescing as &apos; a serious and effective institution &apos; .
its continuing refusal to do all this constitutes clear infringement of the association agreement , of customs union and of the additional protocol , which are its contractual obligations towards the European Union .
but then the ball will be in Turkey &apos; s court and it is up to Turkey to make the next move if further progress is to be made in bringing Turkey and Europe closer together .
new communications technologies represent both a major challenge and a significant opportunity , as information comes at a premium in the field of health care , and we will be able to achieve higher quality care and a better use of public funds if this information can be shared between individual patients and their doctors .
the arbitrary detention of Mr Maguwu is a message of intimidation that the Government of Zimbabwe is sending to human rights defenders and free citizens in the country , to prevent them from reporting on the realities in Marange .
 
anyone who does not want the world to descend into a new type of bipolarity needs a strong Europe and an ambitious Europe .
EU governments are also committed to playing a key role in the reconstruction of Iraq ; the EU made a five-year commitment at the donors &apos; conference in 2003 and will be at the forefront in providing financial assistance to the new Iraqi administration .
who is the main source , the person responsible for the excessive production of waste ?
we cannot discuss two different things at the same time , and I shall therefore have to submit the requests for amendments to the agenda to a vote in the order in which I have received them .
dates of forthcoming sittings : see Minutes
so then we started investigations , which were made public by some of the companies where on-the-spot visits took place .
that is why we must educate and prevent , why we must test and deter and why we must do both these things together .
Mr President , I do not share the opinion that an ongoing uprising in Egypt is dominantly driven by forces longing for democracy of a European style .
well , we cannot do that much .
certainly , once the almost inevitable war is over , the US , through the Quartet , must show resolve for a road map solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict and ensure a viable two-state solution .
the spirit and the letter of Amendment 46 have therefore been respected and extended for the benefit of users , and the rejection of this amendment by Member States on the grounds that the European Parliament cannot impose a change in their internal judicial organisation - which would be required in order to implement this amendment - has thus been avoided .
question No 19 by Liam Hyland ( H-0036 / 99 ) Subject : Tourism
moreover , some of the freedoms have been interpreted rather liberally , so that freedom of expression , for example , is required to respect the bounds of privacy and personal reputation , but no mention is made of blasphemy , pornography or obscenity .
I am not the one who gives permission .
I am very satisfied with these standards because they are forward-looking and because they will , in a practical way , help the sector to observe the rules .
therefore , I am unable to support the suggestion to include the EFDI in general burden-sharing discussions .
Mr President , Commissioner , first of all I would like to thank Mr Markov for the work that has been done and the compromises that have been found in several problematical areas .
the next item is the report by Mrs Harms , on behalf of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy , on the proposal for a Council Regulation on Community financial assistance with respect to the decommissioning of Units 1 to 4 of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant in Bulgaria - &apos; Kozloduy Programme &apos; - C7-0289 / 2009 - 2009 / 0172 ( NLE ) ) .
I believe that the paramount importance that Sakharov attached to Memorial in the final years and months of his life is linked to the fact that he understood clearly this specific aspect .
one third of entrepreneurs in these small firms is over 50 , which corresponds to about 6.3 million work places in Europe .
on the other hand , the measures that are being taken , especially austerity policies in the name of compliance with the Stability Pact and its criteria , not only run counter to the need for job creation and economic growth , but they are also exacerbating inequality and poverty .
I could give other examples of the consultation of interested parties - notably as regards the &apos; motor oil &apos; programme - which demonstrate the usefulness of green papers and their effectiveness in the realization of particular programmes .
this means that where a product is not in conformity with the contract it is assumed that the defect existed at the time of purchase unless the seller can prove otherwise .
furthermore , in order to expedite the work , the Presidency has set up a working group to deal with this issue alone .
as a matter of fact , our long-term rates are at their lowest level for 100 years .
Mrs Frassoni , on behalf of the Council I would like to welcome your report on the Commission &apos;s annual report on monitoring the application of Community law , and the additional analysis envisaged in the Commission &apos;s communication &apos; A Europe of results - applying Community law &apos; .
I should also like to ask Commissioner Oreja , who I know has a very strong interest in these matters , whether he does not agree that this will weaken the voice of Scotland and Wales in particular at this time when we are talking about the future development of Agenda 2000 and all these vital issues ?
women and children have born the brunt of the conflict and the earthquake .
the European Union and national governments support the principle of subsidiarity which guarantees that decision-making incorporates a local input at every opportunity .
where would these requests end ?
the European Union &apos;s marine territory is the most extensive in the world .
for this reason , the strategy should give far greater weight to cross-border cooperation and the role of new Member States .
for example , why not form a single governing board for these four agencies ?
the area of applicability is established in Annex I and cannot be limited in the way proposed .
amendment No 4 raises the strict liability of European Union carriers to the sum of ECU 120 , 000 rather than the Commission proposal of ECU 100 , 000 .
a second point concerns the anti-abortion actions being conducted in relation to this issue .
the end to irrational exuberance on the financial markets paradoxically offers us the chance to turn our attention to the real economy and to influence the factors which are fundamental for the well-being of our citizens .
the Commission remains of the view that full ownership unbundling is the best way forward , but we have continued to make clear that we are ready to consider alternatives that are the functional equivalent of that .
we must come to an agreement with them ; they must be persuaded that , first of all , they need to protect the environment , but that is not all ; all of us involved in transport , tourism , industry , health , nutrition , agriculture and , above all , fisheries , must sit at the same table , so that we can agree and proceed .
as you know , Mr MacCormick has already raised this question in a different way .
such plans should serve as a framework for actions that engage relevant partners and stakeholders . They should define institutional responsibilities and should be based on good practice and safety promotion .
this document represents a sound basis for the negotiations which lie ahead , making it possible - by means of a more determined search for balance and compromise - to achieve the aims and aspirations contained in the preamble , and to arrive at the date set for the ending of the IGC - June 1997 - with a new , updated Treaty on European Union which is equal to the challenges of the twenty-first century , above all the future enlargement .
in connection with previous votes on this subject , we have clearly expressed our view that there should be no more issues on the agenda than it will be possible to resolve at the Nice Summit in December .
Mr Galeote &apos;s report and the proposals of the committees which have drafted opinions will provide an excellent basis for paying it .
it is this change which is leading to the consumer &apos;s distrust .
if certain countries want to use the derogations , the derogations should be allowed for their area only and they must be responsible for them .
the next item is the report by Mrs Flautre and Mr McMillan-Scott , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on establishing a financing instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide ( European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights ) C6-0206 / 2006 .
it was therefore important to have participated in the first two stages .
so I think we have done exactly what you would have wanted and that there is a translation error somewhere .
we fully endorse the proposal to release the necessary resources for this financial instrument from the resources originally intended for the Progress programme .
I would like to give you an example : what do we do with all the toys containing chips ?
that is why I oppose Mrs Van Lancker &apos;s report where it refers and alludes to drugs controls in France , notably in unamended paragraphs 5 , 31 and 32 .
( IT ) Mr President , the resolution adopted today has established important principles for the protection of consumers , increasing safeguards against the spread of falsified medicinal products .
there are four points I should like to make .
studies have estimated that by 2020 depression will become the highest-ranking disease in the developed world .
the vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.00 p.m.
we see this in Uganda , we see this in Somalia , we see this in Ethiopia and Eritrea , we see it in Kenya , we see it in Central Africa .
this is essential as any measure which would undermine the single market could further aggravate the impact of the financial crisis on the wider economy .
secondly , the point was several times made in the debate - although the appropriate amendments were eventually rejected - that the poor and marginalized are in some sense the opponents of those who are integrated into society , have jobs , are organized in trade unions and are relatively well paid .
I must say that his words left a very favourable impression .
are there any comments ?
( ES ) Mr President , thank you , Commissioner .
we should also like to call on Thailand to ratify the 1951 United Nations Convention on Refugees and the 1967 Protocol .
Mr President , there are 90 of us who , as MEPs , have signed a motion of censure on the Commission , because it was the only way we had ...
such representation will not in any way constitute political recognition of Taiwan as an independent state , but would be done solely to facilitate international public health and in particular to prevent the spread of highly dangerous communicable diseases , such as SARS , avian flu and HIV .
I appeal to Mrs Oomen-Ruijten , recognizing that the Commission is supportive of her view , to relent and allow this to go to Council to have these technical amendments cleared at this time .
the main purpose of the Commission proposal is to update the existing control provisions on swine fever , so as to take into account the most recent knowledge and experience acquired in controlling its agent .
my constituency in the north of Ireland has seen a number of violent attacks on communities from other Member States and from further afield , as well as a consistent level of homophobic violence .
what we therefore have is a thoroughly unsatisfactory proposal .
with respect to the Pacific , for which I am the rapporteur , we have a collection of 14 - plus one if you include East Timor - very small nation-states .
if we do that , both we ourselves and the rest of the world can continue to move in a direction which is more conducive to free trade .
we note that these African partners are already exerting effective peer pressure on Mugabe so that a solution to the crisis may be found .
there are areas which are clearly allocated to the European Union : the area of competition , where the European Union has the strongest powers ; the area of monetary stability , which is monitored by the European Central Bank , and the Stability and Growth Pact - these are the most important instruments .
and , although the Committee on Legal Affairs is accustomed to the fact that his reports are always excellent , I still wish to congratulate him most warmly .
Article 10 requires that the annual accounts should give a true , fair and comprehensive view .
nevertheless , I must point out that we Members of the European Parliament are here representing our constituents , and the reactions I have received from constituents from the industrial sector in my country to this proposal have been negative .
secondly , the study proposed by the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs - whom I would like to take this opportunity to thank expressly once again - raises a number of questions which are individually worth looking at , but which taken as a whole are likely to result in this proposal facing great opposition in the Council .
but we also need to talk about equipping people with new ways of thinking .
the huge praise that various speakers have expressed for what we have achieved in the run up to Copenhagen is also something that I , unfortunately , cannot go along with .
this will keep it as an enclave within Israel and land links with the West Bank will remain subject to Israeli control .
that is our fault and there is blood on our hands to this day .
any signal that we as the European Union give at this point is crucial .
in any event , we have already reached the compromise that children allocated under the old legislation will be delivered to the corresponding families , and this is what is actually happening at the moment .
ladies and gentlemen , I would also like to say that on 10 March 2009 the Council achieved a political agreement that all Member States would have the option , based on a change to Directive 2006 / 112 / EC , to implement permanently reduced VAT rates on a range of labour intensive services , and these are usually services provided by small enterprises , of course .
but your intervention is accepted .
6 . Submission of nominal catch statistics by Member States fishing in the north-east Atlantic ( codified version ) ( vote )
in short , I hope that , given this thick crude oil , you will also ensure that oil can possibly be drained from the actual tanker .
our priorities are the Balkans - the European Union &apos;s main assignments - North Africa , the frozen conflicts in the East and our contribution to resolving the conflict in Palestine .
there also needs to be a willingness to go into the arguments and to enter into a real dialogue .
thirdly , this early retirement proposal has a neutral budgetary impact .
nevertheless , it is a fact that we need to fundamentally review our approach .
in relation to food security , the fight against disease , human rights and migration , especially support for more fragile states , we have also constantly asked the Commission to do more and better for and with Africa .
we must tackle the situation head on and maintain the balance of the state , of the European Union and of the world .
I am therefore looking forward to the response .
a point she made very clear in her statement , which I would endorse , was that we cannot lose ground .
however , the number of petitions that could not be accepted did not drop by much .
the EU has to bring all the Member States together to put in place integrated national systems for implementing the plan .
the next item is a joint debate on the following six motions for resolutions on the humanitarian crisis in North Korea :
I urge both sides of industry to make employment contracts more flexible and further modernise the organisation of work .
( EL ) Madam President , I should like to send a message of solidarity to the citizens of Hungary .
to sum up , the bombing is not achieving its aim .
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Madam President , I thank the Commissioner for that response .
Africa has also entered into certain commitments too , however .
 
the next item is the debate on the general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2003 .
our role is to act as the guardian of the Treaties , verifying objectively , once we are in possession of all the relevant information , that Italy has correctly applied the Community law applicable in these cases .
it is the case that , according to Articles 11 , 12 and 13 of the Treaty , we are obliged to coordinate our positions .
Commissioner , will you support that Amendment ?
I have been a development minister providing humanitarian assistance on a national basis to countries torn apart by war .
we cannot tolerate this and that is why we Greens will be holding a campaign called : We want our rights back !
the other question is who should bear the cost .
the end of June is far too late , not to mention the fact that a &apos; balanced proposal &apos; means something else .
without it , you will experience yet more avalanches , and this time they will hit populated areas .
Madam President , I should like to return to the question of what used to be called the Madrid criterion , the question of implementation capacity .
that would be of enormous importance to me and I hope you are able to do so tonight .
sometimes , it seems as if our relationship with Russia is merely a &apos; give &apos; relationship on our part and a &apos; take &apos; relationship on theirs .
however , we are still paying for the current procedure and , of course , the new procedure is not available yet .
the regular Eurobarometer surveys suggest that these visits are effective in promoting awareness of the European Ombudsman , which often increases after a visit .
I therefore do not share the vision of marine ecosystems and the associated fishing communities as a market , where fishing rights may be freely traded , perhaps even on a kind of stock market , which would naturally lead to the industrialisation of fishing and pose a threat to the equilibrium of the ecosystems and fishing communities .
we also know that radical Islamism of the kind preached by Hamas is very dangerous , that the elements associated with it are the forces behind global Islamist terrorism , and - of course - that we Europeans must defend ourselves against it .
the Member States that play the biggest role in the applicant &apos;s entry into the EU should be responsible for examining his or her application for asylum .
it is true that the assessments in this report concern the impact on undertakings and the economy , but the planned strengthening of the system will automatically also have an indirect effect on the social and environmental sectors .
the Union is the only political entity which is capable today of making each side see reason and of helping , at the same time , both the Israelis and the Palestinians .
secondly , a proposal for a directive that will enable cross-border legal action to be taken in the most serious cases of a violation of the highway code : speeding , drink driving and driving without wearing a seat belt .
Russia recently placed a ban on imports of plant products from Lithuania and now from Poland .
of course certain safeguards are needed when forwarding people &apos;s personal details ; of course the European Union &apos;s data protection rules must be adhered to .
these include mandatory women &apos;s quotas on corporate boards , as well as all other levels , the consistent combating of precarious employment conditions , which affect women far more than men , the improvement of career prospects for women during education by systematically expanding the range of careers open to them , a ban on financial disadvantage to women in taxation and income , statutory equality plans in business and industry in order to promote women , and regular checks and reports on the progress achieved in Europe , if any .
in the digital age in which we live , the effective safeguarding of copyright and related rights is exceptionally important in order to limit piracy and ensure that royalties are paid to right-holders .
question No 33 by Hans Lindqvist ( H-0150 / 96 )
with your help , I would like to try to tidy up the report a little and remove a number of redundant items .
the people in the area must understand , as must we , that occupied protectorates in any shape or form never allow economic development , they never allow peace and they never allow countries or people in the area to be strengthened .
the second book is known in English as China in the Shadow of Globalisation and constitutes a warning to the effect that accession to the WTO might cause China to split into five parts .
it also provides a good example of how the principle of conditionality can work in the Western Balkans .
we can accept the improvements of wording in Amendment No 14 , and we can also accept the extension to five years of the time-limit for the adoption of procedures .
after that , we must look to the longer term considerations addressed by Mrs Paulsen and Mrs Jackson .
but this is a commercial project and I have no objections to that .
this involves imposing a limit on the time allowed to consult citizens , but I continue to believe that three months is much too short .
the hitherto responsible authorities have turned a blind eye far too often to the difficulties encountered in European plants and have approved plants that never should have passed the conformity assessment procedure , as Euratom did in the cases of Belene and Mochovce , for example .
I welcome the movement towards the recognition of judicial systems in the various countries and the cooperation on crime .
the European Parliament , which has always been keen to act as the European Union &apos; s moral conscience , has actually managed to acquire a human face during your term of office , and that face has been yours , for which I thank you .
as regards the compromise amendments proposed by the rapporteur , they provide for an improvement of the process of repartition and reserve of capacity in terms of quality railway lines for international freight trains , as well as the establishment of a reserve capacity for short-term demands .
Mr von Wogau , we will take good note of your comments .
Mr President , the decision of the Council is brutal for the European , and therefore the Hungarian sugar industry , and hence it cannot be accepted .
that is why we need the EU to be committed .
this is true above all in respect of antifouling paint for boats , but I am nevertheless in favour of the report .
Madam President , this highly stimulating report by Mrs O &apos; Toole gives us the opportunity to think more deeply about the future of book-publishing and to develop new initiatives .
that has to be banned !
the substance is the same .
as we have said that we , as a group , will not table any new amendments , we are abstaining .
moreover , in general , it is also agreed that it is in the countries that have maintained their social welfare systems and their public services that the populations have suffered relatively less as a result of the crisis .
so far , so good .
a good deal of time is wasted at baggage collection too .
we have also been encouraged by the high level of commitment shown by the new Member States . The Commission fully shares the view that this process must be accelerated and is thus grateful to Parliament for the strong political support it has given to the Union ’ s social inclusion process .
the Commission will do all it can to present you with an initial analysis on the feasibility of this project by the end of the year .
in writing . - ( PT ) I voted in favour of the report on the arrangements for importing fishery and aquaculture products into the EU in view of the future reform of the common fisheries policy ( CFP ) , as I believe that issues relating to the import of fishery and aquaculture products to the EU should be given particular attention in the light of these ongoing reforms of the CFP .
it is not responsible at this juncture to say &apos; I am not happy with this , goodbye , have a nice day &apos; .
future generations will be powerless in the face of the effects of climate change if no global action is taken today .
certainly , insufficient funding is also an important problem .
in conclusion , let me reiterate the risk that we run as a Parliament if we dilute our effort by not concentrating on the main issue and insist on poking our nose into matters which are not our competence .
however , the concrete proposals put forward in this report - which focus on the interests of consumers - merit our agreement .
it is absolutely clear , as also pointed out in Mr Bowis &apos; report , that funding is the main priority .
on behalf of the UEN Group . - ( LV ) Ladies and gentlemen , at times President Putin &apos;s rhetoric reminds us of the possibility of Russia aiming its missiles at Europe .
I agree with the criticism expressed here by Mr Suominen : the representative of the Greek Presidency should have been present here while we are speaking about the Northern Dimension .
Mr President , I too think that religion should not form the basis of the consensus to live in society .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am not croaky , I am glad to say , but my voice does quaver a little when I speak of the Mediterranean , which beckons us towards the sun , beaches , and holidays .
to a large extent , this will depend on the role of the supervisory authorities , which will have to carry out their mandates competently and effectively so as to pass on the necessary confidence to investors and companies .
I believe that with more and better participation at the various levels of decision making , the aim of territorial cohesion , based on a vision of integration , will be realised .
I think it is necessary , which is the reason why I have voted in favour of this report , for farmers and agricultural workers in general to be given accurate information about animal feed composition , but also to be sufficiently protected from financial , social and economic loss in the event of a disaster .
many Member States of the European Union have , unfortunately , been faced with a wave of mergers , restructurings and numerous redundancies , such as at Danone , Marks and Spencer and Moulinex , to name but a few .
we are not yet able to comment on the conclusions of the interim report in this House , but I do wish to raise two points that I feel are extremely relevant .
however , the question now at issue is whether or not to earmark .
I do not know whether it is the job of the European Parliament to ban pornography on the Internet , for example .
I propose a completely different approach .
there is no two ways about it . It is therefore our duty to take this into account when applying EU rules and regulations .
Mr Christodoulou &apos;s report and the compromise amendments that accompany it are , as a whole , consistent with the logic of the stability pact presented by the Commission .
embryonic stem cell research also involves the destruction of embryos .
the important thing is not to transmit all of the information that you have , but to transmit the information that is relevant to those who are receiving it .
the international institutions and international law of today were shaped and created in a completely different world .
an oral question - B6-0321 / 2007 ) concerning the rise in foodstuff prices and consumer protection by Joseph Daul , Lutz Goepel and Neil Parish , on behalf of the PPE-DE Group to the Commission ,
vocational education and training must be adapted to the needs of the labour market .
a large number of petitions have been sent to the European Parliament on this issue .
history has taught us that caution is necessary , but delays or hesitation in the face of unsatisfactory results can be devastating .
the next item is the report ( A6-0383 / 2005 ) by Mrs Ferreira , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , on the environmental aspects of sustainable development ( 2005 / 2051 ( INI ) ) .
we must not alter our opinion under pressure from some third country or under the influence of economic interests .
we must bear in mind that the principle of health and safety protection beyond certain limits on working hours constitutes a general safeguard value that demands a foundation of common rules and references for the very definition of the social and economic employment model and the principles from which the European Union must take its inspiration .
to have a CAP policy buying in food from third countries - whose poor people are already hungry - to feed our poor , while other CAP policies prevent our farmers from growing enough food to feed the hungry of Europe , simply does not make sense .
let us not forget , Mr President , that Parliament has made a great effort to bring its position closer to yours .
they are therefore quite new rules and we will be using them as a benchmark for our accounting system .
consequently , the fight against and the elimination of poverty should be the European Union &apos;s prime target and first priority .
in my own country , wood chip energy production from waste wood is now becoming very competitive and important .
Madam President , the WTO negotiations have broken down but we are not making too much of an issue out of this because we believe that no agreement is better than a bad agreement .
the third point I wish to raise is that in the fifth programme , which is starting up now - the evaluation of the proposals submitted is being completed - the first priority when selecting proposals is the question of equal pay .
the Commission is prepared to adjust the specification of the benchmark consumer which would be used to assess the impact of commercial practices .
I wish to draw your attention to the fact that , due to the crisis , thousands of redundancies have been made in the rail transport sector , which may have an adverse impact on European rail transport .
novel foods and food ingredients
how do you intend to deal with the diversity of the African countries ?
this has been a very interesting exchange of ideas .
a few weeks ago , Turkey signed both UN conventions on civil and political rights and on economic and social rights .
that is the problem in a nutshell .
we have a speaker to oppose the motion .
specifically , I feel two essential aspects here ought to form part of both the discussions and their conclusions .
talking about the fragility of the government right now and the situation in Moldova , we have to remember experiences at the beginning of the 1990s in this country , when the difficult economic situation led to a failure to pay pensions and salaries and to a break in reforms .
it would probably have been useful , in studies carried out prior to the Urban plan being set in motion , for this other type of consequence to have been taken into account .
if you had included a restriction , you would also have had no disagreement with the USA .
Mr President , we also naturally support the referral motion .
nine out of ten Chinese manufacturers violate international labour standards and even labour standards laid down in Chinese legislation !
on 1 December , the twentieth ACP-EU plenary session will be held in Kinshasa .
having said that , I think that many fishermen believed that this ban was not necessary .
a pre-accession period that is shorter or longer depending on the characteristics of each country , a period culminating in the certain and legally well founded accession of the country concerned to the European Union , with financial interventions to support each country &apos;s development efforts , is the best solution and is exactly the basic political concept which this report advocates .
as I was saying just now - and Greece &apos; s case applies to the other Member States too - the stability pacts are based on figures provided by the countries themselves .
what was the balance of opinion on that occasion ?
our efforts must , for example , be directed at making sure that efficient screening programmes are in operation and implemented among those sections of the population that most need them .
the next item is the statement by the Commission on the results of the G7 meeting on employment of 1-2 April in Lille .
the proposed targets , and in particular the 20 % reduction in greenhouse gases by 2020 , are achievable in spite of the many difficulties to be overcome .
the Democratic Republic of Congo has experienced similar conflict and almost 2 million civilians have been killed there or are missing over the last two to three years .
for this reason , the Socialist Group and the Committee on Development , for which I am rapporteur , support this discharge .
however , the important thing is that Parliament , as co-legislator , must be kept fully informed of the reasons why the Commission , in exercising its right of initiative , has not followed up on Parliament ’ s wishes .
we must also remember that the regions which most need help are found in Romania , Bulgaria and the Eastern Wall of Poland .
topical and urgent debate
growth seems hampered by society ’ s increased uncertainty .
finally , and this will be my last comment , there is the question of the administration of aid .
we fully support the intention of contributing to sustainable development of fisheries , which is also the aim of the new fisheries agreement . The agreement must not entail detrimental consequences for fisheries and the population in Madagascar either .
I cannot overlook this .
Mr President , let me just reiterate the point that , as I recall it , the Conference of Presidents resolved unanimously - something it very rarely does - to ask the Chairman of the Convention to join us for this part-session .
this is a social reality which must not be forgotten , especially since , in economic terms , European production accounts for less than 25 % of European tobacco consumption .
public security , plurality of media and prudential rules are considered to be interests compatible with EC law .
nevertheless , the largest democracy in the world does have the greatest influence in the region and bears some humanitarian responsibility here .
Mr President , I would just like to ask all those who stood up to request checking the quorum what they think of the fact that , thanks to their action , we are not now going to vote on emergency aid measures for Ethiopia . In all honesty , I think we need to make journalists aware of what we think of this kind of action .
it is precisely upon price levels that consumer policy has failed to focus sufficiently . In fact , competition policy and consumer policy belong together .
election observations in new and developing democracies are rightly seen as a priority of the EU and a demonstration of its commitment to these nations .
our understanding of gender equality is , for many , still at a medieval level today ; or , at least , this is what we have heard in some speeches .
the solidarity and cohesion of people all over Europe depend on the thought that you can post a letter anywhere and it will be delivered anywhere else , at an affordable stamp price .
I personally have confidence in a model that , first and foremost , upholds the subsidiarity principle , giving the Member States sufficient leeway to adapt the rules on working time to their own economic situation .
what was then a Utopian ideal is now political reality .
I should remind you that , according to the comprehensive peace agreement of 2005 , South Sudan has the opportunity , at the end of a five-year period , of voting whether or not to remain as part of the Sudanese state .
the Union and the US are organising , and will jointly chair , a conference on the reconstruction of Iraq , to which I referred this morning .
access over the line of control between India-administered Kashmir and Pakistan-administered Kashmir is also of vital importance .
this appointment is therefore important with regard to the content of monetary policy .
the second point I want to make links in with our competitiveness .
the Commission is right to comment , in its proposal for a directive on the right to reunification , that the presence of family members facilitates normal family life , thereby creating greater stability and enabling the individuals concerned to put roots down in the host country more successfully .
some might think it is clever to use early television images of pan-European friendship as a metaphor for EU cultural integration .
nonetheless , we must recognise that this debate is belated at European level , as there have been adequate statistics which should have galvanised us into action since 2005 .
it is very important that the present and future measures taken by the EU also have the support of the EU ’ s partners .
there are numerous examples of the failings of alternative systems such as deteriorating quality , an increase in tariffs , even that the service can no longer be provided .
but the points have been set .
the Committee on Culture and Education had therefore proposed that the 790 band not be opened in the first instance , but unfortunately , the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy did not follow our suggestion .
at a time when we often speak about &apos; lobbying &apos; , I hope that , in view of the year 2003 , along with all the organisations , we can use our influence on all the Commission and Council bodies to translate these recommendations - or at least some of them - into directives , so that a European disability policy can be developed in Europe .
we all have a huge responsibility when addressing them because promoting double standards would morally outlaw us , and we certainly lose credibility .
we will make full use of the upcoming review of Iran which will be held at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva in early February .
it may be public .
Cyprus is just about ready for integration , technically speaking , but the political problem has still not been resolved .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m.
it is important that there is a soft landing and I would support an annual increase in milk quotas up to 2015 .
how can we say to our people , our constituents , that this Parliament represents their views , when their views are not allowed to be heard ?
in the case of value added tax , as I said , huge amounts are being lost .
subject : EU membership and EMU
as MEP for one of the regions most affected , I can say that every contribution is welcome .
in order to achieve the EU &apos;s strategic objectives , the Commission should not start developing new tools from scratch until the existing ones , such as SIS II or VIS , are fully operational and reliable .
on the other hand , we must bear in mind that our competitors are in a very strong position .
around 300 000 people in Latvia , many of whom have lived in Latvia all their lives , have had their basic civil rights taken away from them .
expel him from the Chamber immediately !
any suspension would lead to passengers and airlines from the Union experiencing significant losses to the benefits that they have enjoyed since March 2008 .
the current practice in the EU is based on exclusive development , which means that each company retains the ownership rights in respect of the new ideas it generates .
it has to be recognised that the Commission ’ s proposal contains a number of weaknesses .
however , this strategy will only be successful if there is a budget corresponding to its activities ; to its objectives .
fourthly , recognising that Asian countries are crucial political partners for the European Union - a point which we are discovering in the present talks on international trade .
I want this to be clear , especially for some of the German tabloids who have led this campaign .
too often , we have heard that spectrum planning and management is a technical issue that is the exclusive competence of the Member States .
that is why , on 29 September , the Commission proposed some amendments to the SIS II migration instruments , amendments on which your Parliament is currently being consulted .
it does not seem to be far from Maastricht to Amsterdam .
naturally we will maintain close contact with the French Government and continue to monitor events .
but is it not taking a rather over-optimistic view of how much willingness there is within the European Union to admit the candidate states ?
it is as if we were thinking that the Lisbon Strategy , of which this Institute was supposed to form a significant part , is just another piece of paper , and that these are just more politicians &apos; fairy tales .
I do welcome the fact that the Commission is seeking to direct public expenditure towards productive investment ; this is something which Parliament has also called for , and in this respect the Commission is going a step further than in last year &apos;s annual economic report .
in writing . - The establishment of a permanent crisis mechanism for the EU to strengthen financial stability is a step in the right direction .
since I took office , I have made every effort to advance the DDA and to keep it on track .
I believe that this very Cohesion Policy , which we will make a decision on today , runs counter to these ideas they are proposing .
I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the petition concerning the failure of the European Commission to take action regarding a competition case and the harmful impact of this on the company concerned .
if that is not the case , then we should not be required to sit here drinking coffee for an hour .
finally , let us not forget the millions who are suffering , let us not forget the children who are dying and let us not forget that we , the European Union , must not be inhumane .
earlier , we were told that working people would have to bear the cost .
they play an important role in planning or following market trends .
I also thank the High Representative - and we will discuss this further on 23 April - for agreeing to be present at the hearing of the Committee on Foreign Affairs on the subject of the external service , which we will have the chance to discuss in greater depth .
finally , I apologise sincerely to the Commissioner that , as the debate has run several hours late and I have a plane that will not wait , I will have to listen to his answers on the Internet .
it is an element of his or her culture and existence , of the economy and of the environment .
this is its most positive aspect .
almost one year on from the event , we are gathered here to discuss this delicate issue , which caused extensive damage to passengers and businesses involved in both the air sector and , lest we forget , in other industries , too .
the aim of the Schuman Plan was to merge markets , modernise and expand the production of coal and steel , as well as improve and establish equal living standards for workers in these industrial sectors .
Madam President , this is a point on which I would like to express my agreement with the Commissioner .
Mr President , I should like to begin by saying how appalled I am that Commissioner Fischler is not here .
we have found that the habitats directive is locked in controversy and law suits .
in the West , it is a little known fact why that is , for the nuclear power station was located in Ukraine .
we must move away from the perception of an &apos; all boys club &apos; to a more representative grouping running the EU .
for that support I believe I can say on my own behalf and on behalf of Irish people , thank you to the EU for believing in us and supporting us on the road to peace .
in the case of credit offers , the information given to consumers will be contained in a new European credit information form .
his Holiness the Dalai Lama has indicated that he would not be pressing for full independence provided that Tibetan culture , the way of life , can be safeguarded .
another issue I would like to touch upon is that special provision should be made for peculiarities and differences caused by the geographical location and topography of various Member States such as Greece , the United Kingdom , Denmark , Finland , etc . , whose remote or island nature causes particular problems .
if that were to happen , it is by no means certain that certain Member States who pretend to be ardent supporters of social policy and transparency will emerge with their pretensions increased or even intact .
as far as the Committee on Commerce and Distribution is concerned , however , I would like to remind you that this is made up of representatives of Chambers of Commerce that have been recommended in the European Commission by the national Chambers of Commerce , or of representatives of the trade associations of the Member States .
I am not against taking one or two members of staff or whoever it might be into the bar , but to bring visiting groups of 20 or more into it is wrong .
it is the principle of the supremacy of Union law , even over national constitutions , which is now being written into the treaty itself for the first time . And that is why it is a new written constitution , which Great Britain is now getting for the first time in your lives and in the lives of other Britons .
it is therefore crucial to put forward reasonable objectives in order to avoid costly failures .
Commissioner Michel has the floor on behalf of the Commission .
it is unacceptable .
it is by chance that , for ten years , we have done nothing to combat BSE .
there are valid environmental and road safety reasons to transport goods - if they must be transported by road - at night .
part one
although the text maintains that the Member States cannot impose restrictions on internet end-users , it does pave the way for consumers to be restricted by access providers without any prior decision by a judicial body .
it is important for Europe , but it is important , above all , for Sweden for , there , we still have a debate which very often comes down to a &apos; yes &apos; or a &apos; no &apos; to the European Union and which is not focused upon the content of the Union or upon the way it should look as an organisation .
in writing . - ( HU ) The Tibetan crisis fills all of us with alarm and we sympathise with the victims .
first of all , funding will have to be provided from the Community budget , and EUROPOL staff will acquire the status of Community officials .
you will know of the Driving Time Directive in road transport , and some similar control over the driving time should be applied to all drivers , including locomotive drivers .
if I am not mistaken , it is now the seventeenth time that the European Court of Auditors has failed to issue a declaration of assurance .
listening to a radio set the elderly inhabitants asked Mrs Yusupova : ‘ Are they going to help us ?
the Swedish Social Democratic Government &apos; s bargaining on this issue shows , however , that there has been no concern about , or belief in , people . Instead , it is only the tax base to which close attention has been given .
– The news from New York brings us relief and satisfaction .
the recent problems there arouse the concern and interest of all Members of the European Parliament .
we need more European thinking instead of wrong-headed national egotism .
it is not enough to establish the problem ; we need to resolve it .
in any case , this issue is of such significance as to require some in-depth comments .
I also look forward to the Environment Commissioner ensuring both that the many mutually contradictory water directives are made compatible with each other , and that water policy is incorporated into other policy areas such as agriculture , industry and transport , where these are subject to the consideration of a sustainable environment .
in writing . - I voted in favour of the Szájer report on power of legislative delegation and Speroni report on Ransdorf &apos;s immunity .
regulations on nationality and the integration of people from third countries are still outstanding .
that is important progress .
I am encouraged by the growing confidence of ACP parliamentarians , and that has been demonstrated , as Mrs Flesch says , by the extensive participation now from both sides in the debates we are having .
Liberals and Democrats asked for clear assurances in three areas : super-Commissioners , gender balance and transparency .
the common position therefore regulates when third parties can copy copyright protected works such as texts , graphics , music or films .
Parliament is not at the beck and call of the media and Parliament must have its own rhythm of working , or we will end up putting any old thing on the agenda .
much of it is genetically modified .
that is why I welcome this proposal .
finally , the Meda programme .
the impact of such measures is extremely damaging to the economy in the medium and long term .
this in itself constitutes a valuable contribution to agricultural policy .
subsequently , the Presidency presented a President &apos;s statement , warmly endorsing the Secretary-General &apos;s plans , and noted that the EU is prepared to respect the conditions of an overall solution in accordance with the principles that form the basis of the EU , and this with a view to arriving at a solution that makes it possible for Cyprus to accede to the EU as a united island .
having a monitoring mechanism for greenhouse gas emissions in place has always made sense as part of an overall coherent strategy to limit greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy efficiency .
within the framework of a clearly neo-colonialist policy , the European Parliament is calling on the Balkan countries to come into line with euro-unification and euro-Atlantic standards , to set integration into the EU as their sole prospect , to change their political structure and their internal legislation and to condemn their past .
the resolution contains much that is laudable in our view but , because we voted against quite a few of the proposed expenditure increases in the vote on the figures for the budget , it was impossible for us fully to support the resolution ’ s conclusions .
we held out the hope and the desire and the wish that those countries could become part of the European Union .
I appreciate the Czech Presidency &apos;s support for this version .
lastly , it also needs to offer these victims useful advice .
I therefore insist that these barbaric acts be investigated and that those responsible be punished .
Mr President , hearing the other speakers , I note that we all agree on the facts .
Mr President , I voted against the Bowles report .
nevertheless , and in order to take account of the concerns of the honourable Member of Parliament , the Commission , and especially the Director-General for External Relations is currently preparing a proposal for a Council regulation concerning trade in equipment which may be used for torture or other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment .
it would also enable us to put a stop to the humiliating farce for the country that these accession negotiations have become .
as you have heard , our mission was carried out in tandem with a visit by President Sarkozy , who had planned to make a trip to Syria and Lebanon and who then decided to visit Egypt and Israel to reinforce these efforts , still on the basis of our declaration of 30 December 2008 .
in Amendment No 30 , the deadline could delay compensation of the victim ; furthermore , there is an erroneous reference to Directive 84 / 5 / EEC that does not contain any provision referring to the compensation body .
the EU Court of Justice ruled in 2002 that traditional designation clauses in Member States &apos; bilateral air services agreements infringe EU law .
this situation is even more serious if we take into account the increase in undeclared female workers , and the fact that many women have no choice but to accept precarious jobs .
I am sure that you will not mind if I do not quite use up all of my two minutes &apos; speaking time .
furthermore , in accordance with the Gothenburg conclusions , the Belgian Presidency will support the efforts made and to be made by Romania , which still has 14 negotiating chapters to be opened .
it was after the elections in November , though , that the offer of a new partnership with Europe and , more specifically , with the EU , was made explicit .
Europe has seen the creation of the so-called Technology Platforms , company-based strategic research initiatives , which are excellent examples of partnership between the public and private sectors .
from an organic point of view , we are against the interference of supranational structures in environmental policy .
good global governance is not enough to solve these problems ; the demands of the country also need to be better understood .
that is why we ought to have had a stricter proposal with regard to advertising aimed at children .
of course , I understand that there are commercial considerations .
there is no tradition of criminal justice research in Ireland which means that policies are often based on intuition and expediency and not on facts and principles .
I am one of those Germans who want to ensure that it never happens again .
the main aspects of the regulation are the following :
a special new Internet channel , the European tourism channel , brings tourist information systems into the home and therefore provides a revolutionary new route for efficient tourism marketing .
in view of this , I have presented an amendment to Parliament &apos;s resolution on this matter , requesting an international set of sanctions to be set out in the final text .
hopefully it will be possible to deploy this force for the first time in Macedonia .
for over 40 years , human rights have been violated in this Asian country , and thousands of individuals have been persecuted and punished for opposition activities .
when will there be a revision of the Commission ’ s mandate for WTO talks ?
we call for the release of Mrs Saberi .
the Forum &apos;s objective is to give credibility to this entire process .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , let me just start with warm thanks to the rapporteur , Mrs Paulsen .
the fact that in Madeira Porto Santo or Porto Funchal can be included , in the Azores Punta Delgada , in the Canaries Santa Cruz de Tenerife , Cristianos , Santa Cruz de la Palma , San Sebastián de la Gomera , Las Palmas or Arrecife , in Réunion Pointe des Galets , in Guadeloupe Pointe-à-Pitre , or in Martinique Fort de France and Basse-Terre , clearly shows how important it is for these archipelagos that their ports can be incorporated once and for all as essential elements within the trans-European networks , bringing these outermost regions closer to the rest of the European Union .
we are well acquainted nowadays with the consequences of abortion .
the cooperation between Interpol and Europol must be further developed .
I would also ask if the Council intends to look more closely into this issue and perhaps examine it in more specific terms .
in 2008 , the Commission established the EU Sport Forum .
this plant is currently mothballed and the workers are on standby .
I am therefore against advertising getting out of control .
let them disarm .
I am quite happy to quote that for the record - although I will leave you to judge for yourselves .
grandiose panEuropean schemes for tackling unemployment do not address local need .
whether there is a postponement or not , we must , above all , avoid adding confusion to the current uncertainty , and that uncertainty is very real .
the responsibilities of the European Union are based on the principle that there are some things we can do more efficiently at European level .
Prime Minister Balkenende , the Netherlands can contribute so much more to Europe .
our opposition to this process , which forms part of the Lisbon Strategy , revolves not solely around federalist issues relating to legislative harmonisation and to the effective loss of sovereignty over monitoring financial services markets and those operating in these markets , it is also based on economic considerations , given that the unchecked movement of capital and the speculative nature of a market focused on the short term and on accruing capital gains are responsible for increased volatility and for the likelihood of financial crises , which affect economic growth and jobs .
today the impression is still that the internal market is the concern of the multinationals , the major companies , the bureaucrats , Brussels , the technocrats who are far from the concerns of the ordinary people , where many initiatives pile up on top of one another without order or harmony , with no guiding ideas , which , in many cases , are perceived as one more nightmare in the onerous task of living in a developed Community or having a small or medium-sized business .
I can inform you that all the Member States have transposed the directive .
it is therefore absolutely right that a debate should be taking place about the outermost geographical borders of the Union , a debate in which the new Member States should be able to participate .
the rapporteur &apos; s attitude is the exact opposite of this .
the President of the ECB has indicated that it would be undesirable to have Eurobonds introduced in a situation where budgetary discipline is lacking .
but I must speak as the spokesperson for the resolution by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure and say that this is in line with the message the committee has been reiterating down through the years , namely that this Parliament is not dissolving . From the first to the last day of its term , Parliament must continue to rule on any issues that arise and to deal with any problems .
it should also be borne in mind that the Member States can establish their own safety requirements and that fire prevention measures mainly come within the Member States &apos; area of competence .
we support the line you have taken and we are confident that Laeken will opt for the Convention .
what does Parliament really want ?
as we know , Mr Anastasiades is the leader of the ‘ yes ’ movement for the referendum .
I believe that Israel should put a stop to the settlements and avoid taking any steps to annex East Jerusalem .
the General Agreement on Trade in Services does not cover services that are not provided on a commercial basis or in competition with other service providers .
also , the exchange rate of the dollar against the zloty no longer supports the argument about illegal work .
if we take the reform of the major distributive systems , for example , it is vital that we cut back if necessary .
Mr President , I want to support that because it must have been a mistake , either in our voting lists or in our voting procedure , but there was such unanimity in supporting it that it would be very strange if it were not included .
Mr President , two weeks before the Berlin European Council , I believe it is pointless to try to hide the pessimistic atmosphere that prevails .
less helpful in this regard are the hasty proposals tabled by the four smaller groups in this House .
in this respect , we must encourage cooperation between Member States .
the development of family planning services in accordance with the policies pursued by governments , international organizations and non-government organizations , in particular in favour of marginalized sectors of the population ; -the education of women and health education , particularly the preparation , realization and financing of specific policies in the sector ; -the improvement of reproductive health services ; -help for information , education and public awareness campaigns ; -the development of basic organizations and south / south cooperation between the underdeveloped countries themselves.These guidelines , in conjunction with the guidelines on selection of projects in the demographic cooperation sector , constitute a sufficiently precise framework to enable the Commission to plan its activities consistently .
besides these conditions , the applicant countries must also fulfil certain social conditions before they can be allowed to become members of the EU .
( DE ) Mr President , this Statute is important , and it must not be allowed to go under .
as a result , the Commission agreed to a four-year period .
Mr President , I think we can really all agree at the moment that , throughout this debate , we are clearly seeing the importance of making sure that the conclusions of the Barcelona Conference of November 1995 and the Malta Conference of April 1997 are respected , made concrete and put into practice .
for example , if it is a question of the new package of reform proposals that is now before the Turkish Parliament and in which , after long urging by the European Parliament , for example Article 8 of the Anti-Terrorism Act is actually deleted and in which Kurdish private media are actually being given the opportunity to broadcast .
I think that it would do credit to him if he refrained from making such unwise comments in the future .
I want to assure you that we shall continue sending missions to Brazil and to other third countries to make sure that when deficiencies are discovered , they are put right .
how are we to step up cooperation on issues in respect of which we have to cooperate , such as the fight against terrorism , environmental problems , security and energy ?
on the issues of accountability and transparency , we very much appreciate the regular dialogue with the European Parliament and the constructive spirit with which this exchange is conducted .
the next item is the Council and Commission statements on the preparation of the Sixth World Trade Organisation Ministerial Conference , which will take place in Hong Kong from 13 to 18 December of this year .
in our view , the solution is not to defer the introduction of the new harmonised standards or to have two parallel standards of competence existing side by side .
the voluntary code of conduct which underpins the Commission &apos;s recommendation is the very first example of an agreement reached between banking and consumer associations on the standardisation of information which must be made available to consumers before a contract is concluded .
Mrs Karamanou , I recognise the fact that all the efforts that have been made in Kosovo in this field have not been enough .
that , of course , gives us a basis for democracy , human rights and good governance .
this affects both Turkey and other neighbours and new partners , with whom we will have to talk about quite specific new partnerships .
conversely , it is extremely rare in the OECD countries : the United States , Canada , the European Union , Australia and New Zealand .
with respect to the controversial question of non-commercial imports in travellers &apos; personal luggage , two amendments aimed at restricting this sort of situation were rejected in that committee .
I would just like to comment on what the previous speaker said .
in a capitalist world the term &apos; uncompetitive &apos; is synonymous with social scourge .
Mr Nassauer made that clear more than once to the Socialist Group .
Macedonia did not go through a war .
in its raw original form , it called for more prescriptive EU legislation in many areas .
I want to emphasise that when we started working on the documents at the end of 2008 , only four Member States - Austria , Spain , Slovenia and Hungary - had ratified the Convention and Optional Protocol , while another three have done the same - Sweden , Germany and Italy - between then and now .
so again , my heartfelt good wishes , but these in the form of a simple suggestion on the Common Foreign and Security policy : maybe using the process of economic and monetary union to reach diplomatic and military union would be a good way of transforming declarations of intent into more concrete steps .
nevertheless , I am going to stir things up a little .
it would be helpful to gain some reassurances from the Commission in these regards .
those in favour of military interventions will not enjoy hearing this criticism .
Mr President , my reply will be brief , since I believe you now have other questions on the agenda .
outside the context of the review of the Code of Conduct , we have made progress in areas such as outreach .
the implementation of Prime Minister Sharon &apos;s disengagement plan was a development which we cannot but welcome , because it unquestionably constitutes a positive development and an important step towards the peaceful resolution of the Palestinian problem .
of course , we could have done this years ago , but it must all be banned , not just a bit from the skull and a bit from the vertebral column like last time .
( PT ) Mr President , Commission , ladies and gentlemen , we are all well aware of the political challenges that we are facing : globalisation , combating climate change , the ageing population and energy security , among others .
I think they have got this wrong .
we are fed up with it ; Mr Bayona de Perogordo has already mentioned the 2002 discharge .
it is up to us to establish that equality .
following attempts over several months by the Greek Government , with the then Minister for Foreign Affairs Georgos Papandreos , which of course have continued up to today , and the provision of guarantees by it , following the reaction by the European Parliament , which passed a resolution on the subject , and following action by the troika and by Commissioner Chris Patten and the visit to Pakistan , the desired result has been achieved .
the question is whether five years is not far too short .
I do not believe that we should be producing European directives that can be interpreted in different ways .
a few days ago we celebrated the first anniversary of the law on gender violence in Spain .
therefore , Secretary-General , I would like to reaffirm the importance of solidarity and close cooperation between peoples and nations .
I hope that Parliament , like the Council and the Commission , will support this specific compromise package overall .
( Parliament rejected the motion )
in spite of the fact that gender equality is a fundamental right , gender inequality on the labour market , in terms of salaries , employment rates and quality of employment , remains a serious structural problem .
I am protesting , because no information is forthcoming from the authorities in the Netherlands , which are also the presiding country , or from the European Commission , about what products have been sent to the other Member States , so that consumers can be protected .
in Finland they are barely prepared for the change . There is a lack of know-how .
as a matter of fact there is no real peace process going on because the most important issues to be tackled have not been agreed upon .
although , to answer Mr Swoboda , it is clear in the treaty coming into force on 1 December that the High Representative goes directly into his or her new job , but has to be part of the Commission approved by Parliament .
Madam President , I have to say frankly that I do not understand what is happening in Lithuania , or rather , that we feel disenchanted and indignant about this .
that you can make such a speech shows that this is a free and democratic European Parliament !
hence our proposed amendments .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( CS ) Ladies and gentlemen , I , too , would like to add my voice to those who wish to congratulate the rapporteur and thank him for his report .
that is something that , as a Liberal , I , too , can understand and accept , but it must be done in a balanced way and be coordinated at a global level .
I really must refute this ; I can tell you that the judgment of the Court of Justice put the Council in a very good position , and that the judgment was not the reason for the Council making a particular effort to resolve this issue very quickly together with Parliament and the Commission .
that has been proven in the past and we will continue to prove it in the future .
Mr Peter Mandelson does not have an easy task when leading negotiations , as he must try to ensure that the results of the negotiations are favourable to all 25 Member States , and the various benefits given to our various Member States are kept in balance .
as we know , compromise texts have been presented on which there is , as has been said , general agreement .
the compromise accordingly does not affect Member States &apos; freedom to recognise the right to paternity leave within their borders .
feminism has become the employers &apos; accidental instrument to solve staff shortages and to limit government spending .
questions Nos 54 to 58 will be replied to in writing .
we have therefore voted in favour of the motion for a resolution in its entirety , despite the fact that it contains numerous elements which have not been thought through and are unwarranted .
. I shall pass on that question to my colleague , Mr Mandelson , who is in charge of the file .
the fact of the matter is that those displaced are mostly women and children .
this will include discussion with other institutions and with the governments of Member States .
it is because we are keen to see this idea progress that we have put forward this proposal . This is something that needs to be achieved .
it is generally the ethnic conflicts that are discussed , and rightly so .
Madam President , I would first of all like to thank the Commissioner and everyone who took part in this debate .
as I am assured that everyone will have a copy of the Minutes in their own language by that time , we could , indeed , interrupt the debate for a few moments in order to approve the Minutes .
I personally went to ask you to support us in the Convention – you are not from my political family – but you supported us in this challenge from the outset .
and this is at last proof that the Union provides added value for our citizens &apos; actual lives .
in July , I had the opportunity to visit the countries involved and saw that they had begun a very positive recovery process following the internal wrangles and serious conflicts they had experienced , and I could see that they were genuinely on the road to recovery with a real desire to cooperate .
this cooperation forms part of our overall strategy to strengthen relations between the European Union and Russia .
the proposal requires a joint decision-making mechanism for the introduction , review and phasing out of temporary asylum .
we must not miss this opportunity .
&apos; double now &apos; : that was the slogan , and I shall keep saying it .
we should be careful not to end up facing a situation where there is a real threat of having to set our sights lower .
people like myself , for example , who have the misfortune to suffer from kidney stones , must not take too much Vitamin C , because it crystallises .
Mr President , I welcome this point of order , for foresters and the forestry sector cannot wait for the outcome of these rather irregular debates which can only have one effect today , and that is to send out a message proclaiming that the European Parliament is made up of absentee Members , whereas most of our fellow Members , including those here today , are certainly not relaxing in front of their televisions but are working in the field .
it seems to be a general problem as well that cooperation between the Commission and Parliament with regard to international treaties has not yet been clarified .
now is not the time , in my view , to discuss free-trade zones with our partners of the South-Eastern Mediterranean . We should instead talk about development , political dialogue , how to bring our societies closer and about human dignity .
so the only possible compromise is to postpone the Gonzáles Álvarez report and cut Question Time by half an hour .
I understand , as the President-in-Office of the Council was saying , that the freedom of the communication media and the subject of the mayoralty of Zagreb are the questions which are the most direct , clear and obvious responsibility of the Croatian Government .
the second aspect of the improvement of the quality of life in the countryside : the objective should be a women-friendly countryside , facilitating women &apos;s lives in rural areas and allowing women to make better use of their potential .
however , I think it is difficult to entrust responsibility for coordinating experience in this area to the networks .
the expertise lies in the participating universities and higher education institutions .
in the short term , there would be quite a few experiments , because we should need to use some data that we do not have at present , but , in the long term , REACH would result in far fewer experiments because of the introduction of compulsory data sharing , which is definitely also an aspect worth including .
the declaration by the Presidency on 16 April legitimises the attack after the event , acknowledges the sovereignty of the attackers in Iraq and gives the UN the role of mediator in the distribution of the booty .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Madam Commissioner , it is very strange that the same date and the same figure crop up twice in European Union documents : the year 2010 and the figure of 15 % apply both to the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions and to the contribution of renewable sources to the supply of raw materials for energy production .
that is what is happening here .
this seems elementary , yet it must be underlined .
even Amnesty International , which throughout the whole of the criminal NATO bombings in the region , only saw Milosevic &apos; s crimes ( with or without quotation marks ) , has now discovered that NATO committed war crimes in Kosovo resulting in the mass murder of civilians .
the second principle is that the EIB should play an important role as a multiplier effect in mobilising private or almost-public funding , encouraging the involvement of all economic operators with acceptable risk levels , either by means of risk capital operations or the granting of guarantees .
despite the fact that the report also formulates proposals for controlling arms , it remains a report which is absolutely in keeping with the new imperialist order .
Europe has a vital interest in this issue .
in countries which have gone through the experience of systematic urbanisation and forced industrialisation , the problem of energy efficiency in buildings is one which affects millions of citizens .
it is obvious that an assessment can only be made once some progress has been made in the projects .
a few years ago , the three Baltic countries - Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania - essentially lacked any railway link with Europe .
Madam President , since this will be forgotten afterwards in the hustle and bustle of voting , I wanted to take advantage of the time when we are all taking our seats to thank the parliamentary services for their exemplary cooperation in ensuring that the amendments and other documents in every language were delivered to us on time .
for example , exports of road vehicles and cars have fallen by 51.3 % and 59.4 % , respectively .
I am very pleased that , as a fellow member , he is taking the situation of women so seriously .
turning to the co-decision programmes , you have achieved an important EUR 100 million over 6 programmes .
there is also a grave responsibility on us all to ensure we demonstrate that international law applies to us all , and not just to Iraq , and to ensure that the United Nations is given its full legitimacy in the current situation .
here we have a very concrete reason , here we have a very significant change in the situation of this country , which we have been observing for a long time .
the resumed COP6 in July will pick up the threads of the conference in The Hague and try and bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion .
although legislation will continue to be a key instrument , there are a great many reasons why we should not resort to using legislation alone .
therefore , we have requested that the Serbian authorities take further effective action on these matters .
for deliveries and services in these areas , private companies preferred to depend on a reliable government monopoly than on the uncertainty and lack of continuity that characterises the free market .
it is not possible to think that cohesion policy is succeeding , because it is not succeeding when Europe is regressing towards social divergence internally .
it contributes to problems of asthma in children - now said to affect as many as one in ten children in the United Kingdom alone - and to breathing difficulties in the elderly .
the Thyssen plant in Terni , which is currently suffering heavy losses in the magnetic steel sector to the benefit of the Russian company Duferco , is cutting back production and preparing to transfer operations to Mexico , Korea , China and India .
personally I doubt it .
Mr President , surely , since Amendment No 13 has been adopted , Amendment No 10 falls .
I do not think so .
the ability to be democratic goes hand in hand with the ability to discuss .
when foot and mouth disease swept through Great Britain ’ s cattle and pig farms in 2003 , there was no longer any kind of health barrier .
following Mr Sassoli &apos;s request , which I believe will be shared by everyone , we will now observe a minute &apos;s silence in memory of those who died last night .
even the position of my head affects audibility , and I cannot really sit here listening with my head tilted to one side .
we must address this issue because it causes us fundamental problems in terms of the image of Parliament .
I know that no one who is to give birth should eat the fish that I myself and others like me ate throughout the period when we were growing up .
the questions mainly concentrated on some of her business dealings with entrepreneurs who seek to increase their profits by flouting the law or by deliberately acting against the general interest .
companies have made decisive cuts to temporary jobs and there is a fear that the jobs which have been lost will not be replaced .
because the solution that is now being proposed consists of a combination of quotas , bans and charges , the majority of my group will still give it the benefit of the doubt for 2004 , but the problem cannot be solved without building a railway tunnel under the Brenner Pass .
we also must remember that waste does not disappear .
one thing needs to come out of the EU Summit tomorrow and the day after : an apology from the heads of state and government to the citizens in their Member States for their lack of honesty in relation to Community decisions , for failing to provide the public with adequate information , for failing to communicate with them , and for the lack of courage and integrity about their share of the responsibility for decisions in Europe .
( HU ) Right at the start of this item , we need to clarify what we can consider of value to the European Union .
there is , however , a need for further efforts .
let me thank Mr Dell &apos;Alba and the Development and Cooperation Committee very sincerely for their excellent work on the Commission proposal on the future of the European Community Investment Partners .
unfortunately , a small majority in this House has failed to ensure that consumers can enjoy real chocolate .
there are three issues which arise here : firstly , we want to harmonise the provisions on the individual species of fish which are caught using trawl nets of various mesh sizes in all the Community waters in the north-east Atlantic .
fundamentally , the structure of the employment policy guidelines presented is right and balanced .
immigration flows and the study of the phenomenon with possible forecasts .
to those among the new Commissioners who face such reproaches at home , I would like to say that we are right alongside you if you are putting the well-being of the European Union first , for that is the role you have to perform under the constitution , so to speak .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon .
my third comment concerns the IMF &apos;s attitude during the crisis , when compared to that of the European Union .
thirdly , it must be clear that exceptions are only permitted under very strict conditions .
it is right and proper that the Commissioner should mention the Millennium Development Goals as our starting point and our ultimate goal .
there is no doubt that immigrants have rights , but they also have obligations , just as the nationals of the countries of the European Union have .
the EU-Mexico Association Agreement has a history of success - as Mrs Mann , who chairs the Joint Parliamentary Committee , has acknowledged .
the European Union has also inspired the courses of action that the G20 has taken forward to tackle the economic crisis .
 
we need to get a grip on proliferation , and in this context the trade in nuclear technology undertaken by the EU is similar to the trade in heroin in that it is equally lethal .
nor was the ‘ stakeholder dialogue ’ implemented as set out in the programmes . Seventeen organisations were against what was proposed .
in the past year alone , the sum of CAD 800 million was made available for the purpose of attracting foreign professors to the country .
secondly , I do not know what the situation is with structural funds in other areas , but the process for the financial management of the programmes for external relations is unbearably slow .
these were created in response to the 2004 Railway Safety Directive .
what we do not want , of course , is to see a reduced rate of VAT bringing not greater demand and more jobs , but simply higher profit margins .
I believe , however , that the financial effort should be increased .
at the same time , Georgia has become a strategic partner in the neighbourhood policy , which is indispensable for solving the frozen conflicts in the region , a good mediator , an important partner within regional cooperation and a strategic ally in energy cooperation projects and transport .
my parents left Germany 72 years ago .
may I address one last matter ?
even the lack of currency fluctuation that has been caused by the prospect of the euro should not induce us to sit back .
how competitive are those companies going to be in comparison with those companies whose conditions are much tougher and much less economically burdensome ?
I have to say that it was not only my group but many others that took this view .
why should we reward Castro when there is no progress on human rights ?
the Task Force has to deal with two aspects of the problem , revealed by the recent crisis : responsibility - how to prevent such budgetary indiscipline happening again - and solidarity - how to avoid improvisation , if a financial crisis eventually happens again in a Member State .
in the discussions on Turkey , we were surprised by the highly original and appropriate formulations which placed responsibility for accession fairly and squarely on Turkey itself .
it is very important that the national electronic registers containing the data should be interconnected so that data can be compared and the regulation therefore serves its intended purpose .
pursuant to the Rules of Procedure you have the right , Mr Souladakis , to reproduce the questions on the countries of the Caucasus .
in this report Parliament has significantly improved the Commission &apos;s proposal and it is one that I can fully recommend to this House .
it has not been completed yet .
the delays certainly do not contribute to the overall improvement in socio-economic and employment conditions in the regions concerned .
since my son recently joined the British Royal Air Force , military intervention is no longer an intellectual debate but is now a personal issue for me .
the reasons we are in this situation are partly attributable to the absence of a common defence policy , but not entirely so .
we can help with training , but we do not have a mandate to be inspectors and to substitute for national authorities .
as we all know , it takes eighteen months to two years to achieve and then apply an agreement ; until then , therefore , let us apply the bilateral agreement which has existed with Greece since 2002 , as other countries in the south have done to resolve the problem .
the constituent sitting is being held on 14 July .
during the next six months under German Presidency we should also work on a solution to the future of the Constitutional Treaty and the issue of energy security .
only last week , they said that what was on offer was simply not tenable for them .
why are you being difficult now and not giving the ARE group the place that is in fact due to it in this matter ?
I hope that his successor will have more resources in order to take action there .
Mr President , I would like to compliment the rapporteurs on all the hard work they have invested in this report .
. ( PT ) No one any longer denies that there is an information deficit with regard to the European Union , the way it operates and its usefulness .
this is a carrot approach without the stick .
I voted in favour of the present report on new legislation setting emission performance standards for new light commercial vehicles as part of the Community &apos;s integrated approach to reduce CO2 emissions from light-duty vehicles .
Mr President , I want to draw your attention and the attention of this House to the safety of our visitors &apos; groups .
Madam President , it is hugely important to the Liberal Group that we talk about the situation in Cambodia , and that this is done at this particular time , not only on account of the letter which UN Secretary-General , Kofi Annan , has written to the government in Cambodia , asking it to take steps , at long last , to set up a special tribunal in order to call the leaders of the Khmer Rouge to account , but also because the Hun Sen regime , obviously not content with the attempted assassinations of the leader of the opposition , Mr Sam Raninsy , has now considered that his parliamentary immunity should be lifted to boot , so that he can simply be brought before the court .
this strikes one immediately and therefore merits particular attention .
in writing . - ( EL ) As a result of the anti-popular , anti-labour aims of the Maastricht Treaty , the EMU and euro were created , preparing the ground for the reactionary Lisbon Treaty and the escalating attack on workers &apos; rights and freedoms .
in November of this year , this register contained references to more than 250 000 Council documents in all our official languages , and it provides access to the contents of more than 50 000 documents .
this is a condition from which 6 million European citizens suffer , of whom some 300 000 are Italians .
Damascus , Teheran and their Lebanese satellites should stop their sinister game once and for all .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , Jacques Delors is regarded as one of the most successful Presidents that the Commission has had , for it was he who had the vision of creating and completing the internal market .
finally , Mr President , I should like to express my agreement with my colleague Hernández Mollar when he gave his support to the proposal from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market to try to integrate the various texts into a single regulation .
I still take the view that we need a total feed ban on meat and bonemeal at least until we can determine how infectious the prions responsible for the outbreak of BSE are and until we can define different types of bonemeal for each type of animal .
the Commission &apos;s services have prepared a draft of this joint interim plan for reforms .
indeed , transparency is vital to the functioning of the European institutions and it has often been seen as lacking .
if the Commission does not include the possibility of an extension to the transitional arrangements for duty-free sales in its report , will the Council Presidency ask the Commission to bring forward proposals for an extension , in order to meet the reference to a possible extension set out in the conclusions of the Vienna Summit ?
this cooperation is fundamental , not only because of the future installation in various parts of the world of control centres and communication equipment to support the around thirty satellites that will also have to be sent into space , but also because the success of a project of this nature clearly depends on its interoperability with other , existing systems : the North American GPS and , to a lesser extent , the Russian GLONASS .
my group asks the Commission and the Council why we do not export these gas-fired surplus power-stations to the Ukraine where they can soon be supplying electricity .
the directive on the application of patients &apos; rights in cross-border healthcare has many positive features .
Mr President , there seem to be many different recollections but it is certainly my recollection that we agreed in the Conference of Presidents that there would not be a resolution .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - ( NL ) Mr President , Prime Minister , as a Dutch MEP , I am particularly delighted to see you visiting us here .
we are talking , in effect , about traceability , labelling , zero tolerance , maximum thresholds , freedom of choice for the consumer , health , the environment and precautions .
if we were to adopt it , we should quickly regret having done so .
then we can recommend to the European Parliament Council to undertake negotiations with the country concerned , provided that it meets the criteria on the basis of our own analyses too .
 
we have the undisputed potential due to weather and location in the Atlantic .
of course , there is close cooperation between the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
these and others have seen their loved ones killed in the war and yet are unable to be reunited with surviving family members because of the refusal of some governments to grant visas .
I have received one motion for a resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 103 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
here in France , three of his children were able to go to university , something that was impossible to imagine in Ghana .
I refer in particular to the publication of votes and the voting behaviour of each individual member of the Governing Council .
thank you very much , Commissioner .
the EU must stop Turkey and its subordinate local administration in the occupied part of Cyprus from committing further violations , and from continuing the ethnic cleansing of the remaining 300 Christian Greek Cypriots .
such measures are extremely useful given that protein crops currently occupy only 3 % of arable land and the fact that the EU imports 40 million tonnes of protein crops , representing 80 % of internal consumption .
the in-depth review foreseen by the end of this nine-month period will concentrate on the five areas set out in the Council &apos;s conclusions of October 2008 .
further liberalisation without sufficient protection for the European agricultural model will result in a reduction in the number of farmers .
incidentally , as an MEP from a new Member State , I deeply regret that the rural development fund of old Member States has been decreased by 15-20 % , but the rural development fund of new Member States has only been increased marginally , to a very modest extent , even though everybody had said that they would be compensated by an increase for the long , protracted phasing-in period agreed in Copenhagen .
I would like to mention here that we have again come to a very good arrangement in this budget procedure on the very issue of pilot projects and preparatory measures , namely that a vote can be held beforehand on approaches to implementation , so that what the budgetary authority has decided in the budget procedure is also speedily implemented by the Commission .
I must also thank the rapporteur , and emphasise that this is an example of a good compromise and an excellently drafted report .
let us not forget that at its inception the European Union was constituted around problems other than this .
he has been held in inhumane conditions for many months awaiting execution , and his current poor health is a direct result of prolonged torture .
that makes the Baltic incredibly sensitive because , as quite a few speakers have pointed out , it is a shallow sea .
it is a different kind of Europe to the integrationist agenda , but it is no less European for that .
we are told that 25 000 Tunisians are arriving in Europe and people are talking about a lack of security .
special reports of the Court of Auditors
nevertheless , we must develop an overall strategy that takes account of everyone &apos;s reservations .
I think it was Mr Lamassoure who said that it must be better spent .
concerning foreign and defence policies , the insistence on the federalist approach was emphasised , as was the strengthening of the CFSP &apos; s militaristic positions , instead of a decisive pledge for policies of co-operation .
such prohibitions are currently in force in all of the Balkan countries , but the EU is currently making no demands for their abolition .
as Austrian members of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party , we set great store , in connection with the Shelter Improvement Plan and the agreement between the G7 countries and the Ukraine , on the closure of Chernobyl by the year 2000 . Therefore we have chosen to approach the voting in a way which accords with our consistent anti-nuclear policy within the European Parliament .
attention to this is sought in the Brok report but also in the Kuhne report .
if there is one lesson to be learnt from Mr Havel &apos;s speech , it is how to be modest and how to be realistic .
I cannot mix up subjects which are very important with others that , although still important , are less so .
.
that may be so , but if we are working towards equal treatment for people with disabilities , people who are visually impaired , surely we have to start to make progress now and we cannot have an arbitrary cut-on date as opposed to a cut-off date .
you have just said that the Commission is the guardian of the Treaties .
we need Europe to be stronger and more determined .
Mr President , Commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , the external actions contained in heading 4 clearly represent the display window of the European Union and the Commission - of our joint action in the context of our international relations .
this is one thing we ought to be thinking of when requesting more authority , i.e. to find a working method that really functions democratically in Parliament .
Mr President , the Commissioner mentioned the conference convened last week in Vienna by the International Atomic Energy Agency . This organization should really be called the &apos; International Agency for the Promotion of Nuclear Energy &apos; , and in my view it is unacceptable that it should attempt to play down the effects of the Chernobyl disaster on the health of the population of Ukraine .
as this is an EU regulation entering directly into force in Member States , they will have no opportunity to enact stricter safeguards .
they should also write about the culpability of the Western allied forces which returned or extradited exiles into the hands of the Communists .
the question we must of course always ask ourselves is : what harms the people , and what benefits the people ?
on behalf of Parliament I convey our condolences to the family and colleagues of the deceased and also our outrage at this act .
before coming to the proposals contained in my report , it would be helpful to remind ourselves of some of the key issues in this debate .
this could lead to barriers to trade - with regard to imports from third countries , and so on - in breach of the WTO agreements .
on 14 November 2008 , the European Commission approved a real petition from manufacturers of candles , not just a Bastiat-style fiction , and imposed a 66 % tax on candles imported from China .
( ES ) Mr President , as is customary , though this time it is well-deserved , I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur , Mr Belet , for his ability to hold dialogue with all of the groups and all of the Members .
the coming Olympic Games could have been an occasion for improvement .
therefore , if we reduce obligations , we reduce costs , and by reducing costs , we make it easier for them to operate .
the reactors in service include some that western experts consider to be intrinsically unsafe and others that require technological improvements if they are to meet adequate safety standards .
it ought to strike a balance between the principles of , on the one hand , &apos; one country , one vote &apos; and , on the other hand , &apos; one citizen , one vote &apos; .
please ensure that , because these people are suddenly no longer able to be involved , they do not end up in cages or having to sit for hours with their hands bound on the frozen ground .
Mr President , Commissioner Šemeta , ladies and gentlemen , the process we are dealing with today - that is , the discharge for the expenditure of the European Commission - is an essential process .
it is not a question of telephone tapping but of storing data , for example telephone numbers , for a certain period .
here is a country which can enter into a trade agreement with the EU without having to join the club , without having to pay the membership fee or take on thousands of directives and regulations every year .
you are the umbilical cord that can still take us from conflict to peace , and this is why we are so interested to hear your proposals and to help you to find the way to overcome these difficult times .
pitiful , Mr President , but perhaps with fifty more deaths ...
the report by Mr Leinen is therefore brought forward and we shall deal with it before the report by Mrs Malmström , and the report by Mr Skinner will be withdrawn from the agenda .
the Group of the Greens has therefore tabled an alternative resolution , because we want to invest heavily in education , in poverty-reduction projects and in exchange programmes , also for students .
in this context , special attention must obviously be focused as well on the security of the travel documents issued by the third countries in question .
having been addressed personally , I wish to point out certain misunderstandings which originate with a Member of the Commission .
have all nuclear reactors in the EU been fitted with pressure-reducing filter systems so that even major accidents do not pose risks to the public ?
first , it is the big eurozone countries that are in serious need of reform .
we therefore want to work out an action plan with each individual country based on experience and our present treaty commitments .
in any case , it will constitute progress if we now adopt the proposal in Mrs Nedelcheva &apos;s report to have a proper law on EU administration procedures , which we finally have a basis for in Article 298 of the Treaty of Lisbon .
are there any comments ?
sometimes we may feel that too much has happened .
we can skirt around the issue or divert to the sidelines .
health risks constitute absolutely the wrong type of advertising .
a solution to the Cyprus question might then also bring greater stability , prosperity and security to the Eastern Mediterranean , and might help to speed up Turkey &apos;s EU accession process to some extent .
I believe , however , that the report adequately reflects the various criticisms of OLAF ’ s work .
I support the three chosen areas for combining public policy : encouraging technological developments ( cars with emissions of 125 g CO2 / km maximum ) , developing market-based instruments ( Emissions Trading Scheme , tax incentives , charges / fares based on environmental impact , etc . ) and using flanking measures to enable means of transport and infrastructure to be used as efficiently as possible .
it draws the attention of the Member States , the Commission , the social partners and civil society to the Directive &apos;s key provisions and stresses the need for full implementation .
this is necessary so that the Human Rights Council can become a truly reliable structure - able to react adequately and , when required , quickly to breaches of human rights in any country of the world , and capable of finding effective means to influence the governments of those countries where human rights are being crudely violated .
the Scientific Committee has identified two phthalates used in toys that may be hazardous to young children &apos; s health .
that is what they are there for , and the citizen is entitled to expect good services .
I shall say the same as the rapporteur , Mr Audy , that of course we have made progress , but that it is not yet enough .
how can it be that this net exporter of goods , services and investments can manage to protect its achievements in the area of production and agricultural prices , thus escaping the alignment of its agriculture with world prices and maintaining the uniqueness of Japanese agriculture ?
this is another interesting story .
why , though ?
I will vote against Turkey .
following this legislative act , I believe , we will need – perhaps in two or three years ’ time – a new initiative to introduce competition among air navigation services , where , as much as anywhere else , competition is required if performance is to be improved .
Iran needs a good future , and it is to be hoped that its President will come to realise that he needs to adopt a civilised approach in his dealings with both people and states around the world .
so far as the campaign against torture is concerned , this principle means tackling the problems at source , for example by educating police forces and prison warders , by investigating the networks where instruments of torture are sold , by awareness-raising campaigns and support where major advances like the optional protocol to the Convention Against Torture are made .
as the rapporteur also points out , it is especially important to review the conditions governing small and medium-sized enterprises , for it is among these that regeneration and technical development take place .
it is part of a clearly-defined project which has furthered peace and democracy in Europe , creating a model of cooperation and development based on the principle of the rule of law and on respect for fundamental values .
( RO ) I too would like to welcome as being particularly useful - and I will be supporting them with my vote - the proposals for transforming the European Global Adjustment Fund into an effective instrument for combating the most painful impact of the economic crisis , namely , job losses .
in this context , on behalf of the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy , I should like to congratulate my colleague Mr Gasòliba i Böhm on his excellent report .
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 7 July 2005 .
I do not usually read my own speeches , but someone read this out to me . There are two words in it which I would like to have deleted , because they were addressed to another Member and were not part of my speech .
( FR ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , many things have been said , especially just now .
perhaps one of the most important organisational changes to have taken place in the Committee on Budgets is the importance given to the interinstitutional working party .
we need to get beyond that stage if we want to be able to produce a balanced and rational report .
Mr President , Commissioner , I wish firstly to say to the rapporteur , Mr Kreissl-Dörfler , that I have rarely been involved in work on a report that has been handled as diligently and fairly as Mr Kreissl-Dörfler has handled this report .
so the Commission made this proposal for an embargo back on 30 January , and the proposal is now on the Council &apos;s table .
when are we going to turn our attention to the essentials ?
the Ugandan legislation in force already criminalises homosexuality .
in the Nordic countries and the Baltic Sea region , it is helpful to know , for example , Swedish , Russian or Finnish .
it is a world where , when people lose their jobs , especially women , they lose 50 % to 100 % of their income and in order to survive , they rely on strong family support , weak national solidarity and your solidarity , thanks to the European Union &apos;s cohesion .
one thing is for sure : increasing taxes - and hence the price to the consumer - will not reduce smoking .
furthermore , the White Paper twists the opinions of young people to say the opposite of what was meant .
the question is : under what heading will they be dealt with ?
rapporteur . - ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I am grateful to everyone who has spoken , because it seems to me that we can look forward confidently to tomorrow &apos;s vote and to the likelihood of reaching an agreement which will constitute a substantial step forward .
the regulation pretends that there is one , but there is not .
at the beginning of the 1990s , there was a great scandal in Italy because a leak from the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Health revealed that they were hiding the real overdose mortality rate . Obviously , it is more convenient for politicians and governments to say that a young man has died in the street from a heart attack than to acknowledge that his death was caused by an overdose , and the same applies to policy-making .
it appears that the re-certification or shifting of aircraft between categories has been regulated .
I also wish to express my concern to ensure good cooperation between INTERREG and the EDF , particularly for the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean .
currently there are no effective structural systems for pedestrian safety on the market , but some years hence they may be developed .
this subject raises a number of political , legal and security issues which need further study and consultation and which - and this is also very important - will require the involvement of the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers in the Member States .
in recent months , the Monterrey Conference has come to occupy a prominent place on the so-called Development Agenda , particularly after the attacks of 11 September and with the realisation that the problems of development in a globalised world require our full , immediate and urgent attention .
firstly , Intelligent Europe is not and should not be the title for this programme but , as the rapporteur herself suggested , should of course be the umbrella title for everything we do in the energy policy environment .
in the next few months , we will be engaged in serious planning for our Partnership Conference , which is to take place in the first quarter of next year , and in developing our medium-term poverty reduction and growth strategy .
at the same time , it is important for the new Eurovignette to take account of the different conditions prevailing in Europe , for example in the peripheral Member States .
all the European institutions that depend on the European Union budget have to be thoroughly audited by the Court of Auditors and by all entities with that function .
my opposition to the Constitution currently is not based on dogma , but it is known – as far as I am aware – that it would not be good for the people of Europe .
the &apos; constitutional treaty or death &apos; approach propounded by Romano Prodi yesterday is a serious mistake , and will bring nothing but tension .
we think too much of them to make them fall prey to the Eurocratic trap , which promises much , offers little and takes the most important thing – sovereignty .
we know how that ended .
I am convinced that a core indicator of integration - and , moreover , for everyone - is adherence to the basic rules of democracy , protection of minorities and respect for human rights .
there is the EU bureaucracy in the granting of aid and the bureaucracy that exists in the countries receiving the aid .
that too is important in the context of the peace process .
in addition to reaffirming the &apos; transatlantic &apos; strategic partnership , the resolution acts as a genuine roadmap to the liberalisation of the financial markets and trade relations between the EU and the US , by listing the obstacles to greater competition and capitalist concentration , to the joy and benefit of large financial and economic groups .
let us hope that you can be given a written answer when the Minutes have been checked .
Europe must look to the future with courage and cannot afford to fail the test of globalisation .
to ensure that European citizens can understand and deal with the changes brought about by the current context , social dialogue must be reinforced in order to increase transparency in decisions on social adaptation and economic restructuring .
ninety per cent of this electrical and electronic waste is currently landfilled or incinerated with no pre-treatment .
reports aimed at improving the competitiveness of rail transport are , from this point of view , very important .
the Code has received wide recognition internationally , in the Member States and candidate states , in the Council of Europe and elsewhere in the world .
the House should be able to agree on a number of demands : we need to channel public funds more directly into productive investment ; private companies must be more strongly reminded of their duty in terms of promoting the economy and jobs ; and we need better coordination of economic policies and stronger links between the policies of the Member States and the Community .
the Pakistani Government must therefore fully investigate Shahbaz Bhatti &apos;s murder and must carry out investigations until conclusions have been reached as it did in the case of the Governor of Punjab .
this includes the majority of the Baltic States .
in writing . - ( HU ) I voted for the recommendation because I find it outrageous that we still have not been able to form a common position on the issue .
this shows that the promises to bring an end to tax havens and financial derivatives have fallen by the wayside .
in my view , it was important to say that the available budgetary resources must be concentrated on policies beneficial to growth and employment .
but we also have a duty to protect children elsewhere in the world who are victims of the worst excesses of certain individuals , of things which we would not want to happen in our own societies .
research is also subject to permanent further development , and the list of research priorities is becoming longer and longer .
Elf provides a particularly striking example of one of these .
finally , we set great store by the Court of Auditors systematically examining the annual reports to see how the Commission has acted upon critical remarks made previously .
what kind of anger is being passed on to new generations of Sahrawis in the Tindouf refugee camps involved in the resistance in occupied Sahara , if they are not taken from the arms of fundamentalist radicals , if the EU , the United States , the Arab world and the rest of the international community denies them an outlet for resolving their conflict , thereby condemning them to impotent despair in the face of injustice , violence and destitution ?
. - ( LV ) Thank you , Mr President , Mr Vanhanen and Mr Barroso .
this is also a European problem , and it is important to ensure that knowledge , research and documentation on female genital mutilation is improved in Europe .
this report supports productivism and liberalism , which goes against the general interest .
we know of the case , and we have asked the French Government to ensure that appropriate measures are taken to prevent any future recurrence .
we need resources for this new Europe that we are helping to consolidate .
another new item is the programme to restructure the Spanish and to some extent the Portuguese fishing fleets which up to now have been able to fish in Morocco &apos;s waters .
I would like to thank Mr Blokland , who mentioned the informal meeting of Environment Ministers held in Ljubljana .
Parliament together with the Commission have always had to fight the Council to get the money needed .
we do need to support SME finance , but the European Union can and should also take other steps to support this sector .
transferring to the EU the responsibilities in this sector which previously lay with Denmark represents a fundamental break with the traditional system of collective agreements which has been very important in shaping the Danish model of society .
in this regard the Council has reached a decision , but not understood its significance .
I should therefore like to take advantage of this opportunity to clarify some issues where I believe further explanation is still required .
it is gratifying that both of our committees want to change that .
we do not really know what is going on &apos; .
why are you delaying so long , to the detriment of our industries and to the detriment of the industries in the countries close to us ?
Europe is big enough .
it is high time Europe started making a difference and really started cooperating with these countries .
the crucial thing is actually to also generate awareness of these tourism products .
recent years have seen a growing awareness within Iran that this isolation was harmful to Iranian interests and leading nowhere .
under this programme , the European Union supports projects and networks to promote all languages present in the EU , including minority languages .
thirdly , we are living through an economic crisis , and as a result we have a responsibility to our citizens .
that is why within our resolution we are calling for solidarity and condemning the action of certain Member States , led by the United Kingdom , who have caused the suspension of the funding programmes aimed at benefiting the poor and socially excluded including the elderly . That is why we are calling for changes in the Treaty .
Commissioner , you know that we are on your side with regard to this matter .
we in the EU must not promote businesses that use women while committing flagrant breaches of their rights .
a Europe of results is a political vision based on constructive pragmatism , designed to address the concerns of our citizens and to provide European solutions for European problems .
Parliament therefore has strong reasons for monitoring compliance with the rules governing global free trade .
the interpretation you have just made runs counter to the way in which this vote has been ordered by your services .
Rheumatism : over 150 diseases and syndromes .
we hope it will be possible to avoid repeating some of the difficulties we are currently confronted with .
Mr President , first of all I want to congratulate the various rapporteurs on their reports .
an ageing Europe needs taxpayers in order to maintain security of the supply of services in the future .
it is time that trade became a tool for human beings , and not vice versa .
the answer leaves no room for doubt : we need a paradigm shift .
from the Ukrainian point of view , they need energy there just like everyone else .
a strategy for the EU &apos;s economic policies must include the following : an action plan on using the structural reforms to reinforce economic growth and employment , consolidated fiscal reform and increasing economic governance of the EU and euro area .
I believe that we , who frequently criticize this sector , should , on the contrary , increasingly support initiatives of this kind , because they demonstrate that this sector also knows its job and , despite the mistakes that it has made in the past , is working to protect resources in the waters of third countries as well as in those of the Community .
what was called for was the most rapid reaction in case X , and this cross-border cooperation between the Netherlands and Germany achieved a really most impressive result .
( the President cut the speaker off )
at the same time it is likely that this will make one more tool available which could help to attain the UN &apos;s target of 0.7 % of GNP .
– Mr President , we all were deeply affected by the attack in Madrid , and I am very pleased that the European Council of last 25 March responded to it by anticipating the solidarity clause .
I do not know whether we will be able to influence the Yugoslav authorities or parliament , but the young people of Yugoslavia ought to know that we are on their side .
we make two &apos; friendly &apos; amendments in the report .
but clearly , on the question of budgetary allocation , we look to the Council and Parliament , as there are conflicting views and voices in this matter in both the Council and Parliament .
in just over one month , on 17 October , this constitutional change could be a .
we are ready to take account of the specifics and the needs of the sporting sector , such as security , which is inseparable from this type of organization .
we therefore have to re-establish conditions of full employment , employment adapted to the society which is taking shape , which we are all building .
from that we could conclude that with some skill and some wit and good judgment , we can continue our wider relations between the EU and ASEAN , taking into account the moral disapproval we may have with some of the new entrants and yet manage to continue a dialogue .
( DE ) Mr President , specifically on a point of order , I am sorry that you responded in person just now .
I wish to raise four points :
in any event , the proposal for a directive is open to amendment as the recovery procedure has been included for possible future enlargements , and this offers some safety for the future . This is an issue that could , in itself , be resolved by potential changes to the European Agreement and International Agreement on the carriage of dangerous goods by road and rail respectively .
it calls for the removal of its flag from the Paris list to continue to be a priority for it .
the Commission therefore welcomes the report from Mr Alyssandrakis .
the car that was supposed to bring me to the European Parliament was over half an hour late , and I would request that this excuse be placed on record .
in spite of all the efforts even simply to make these often stateless vessels comply with the protective and conservation measures , fishing continues to proceed unabated .
and that , in theory , is everything .
many of Mr Pex &apos;s suggestions are also interesting in this respect .
in this document the Commission presents the precise measures it is taking in order to respond to the Court of Auditors &apos; criticisms .
I believe that with these systems , and then with the introduction in the coming years of common or at least interoperable technical standards , we will be able to build a genuine European rail network that can really compete with road transport .
Madam President , I would like to join with others who have spoken in the debate in congratulating Mr Grosch on his report which is generally complimentary towards the Commission .
in addition , an influx of cheap grain to Poland led to a price reduction of approximately 35 % in comparison with 2003 when Poland was not yet a Member of the Union .
in fact , we are already discussing this issue which not only concerns Latvia but also Estonia and others .
currently , there is no coordinated renewable energy strategy on both a European and world scale .
as an Irish MEP I welcome the Single Currency , which is a further positive step on the road to European integration .
agenda
at the same time all these trends show that the industry and the Member States have realised that something has to be done here .
moreover , it is a way of hiding the problem and of hiding the reasons why ordinary people are having to pay the price of climate degradation .
Europe needs protection measures and incentives that are suited to its dimensions .
ladies and gentlemen , please allow me briefly to sum up the three main points of the Spanish Government ’ s immigration policy .
I find it difficult to understand how he can index regional and social funds into this mathematical equation .
it is undoubtedly true that macro-regional policy applies to our strategy for regions such as the Baltic Sea and the Mediterranean Sea .
I , too , along with my other fellow Members , believe that we are at the point where sustainable results can only be achieved through dialogue , which is only possible with a cease-fire agreement .
companies must be held to account .
whilst courteous , the Finns did not succumb to window-dressing , and instead raised the issues of the murder of Anna Politkovskaya , human rights in Russia , and the unsatisfactory state of democracy in the country .
as chairman of the delegation to the EU-Malta Joint Parliamentary Committee , I have been a privileged and attentive observer of Maltese political life for two years .
we also have the problem of development , though , with a view to tackling that , we have the Doha Round , which needs to be restored , the multilateral agreements , the association agreements and the Millennium Goals .
votes
thus , we consider imperative the application of the principle of precaution .
in my view , cooperation has been excellent this year .
I am not sure whether it is too late to raise this point , but there is a point concerning translation , given that Italian is the original version of the Di Lello Finuoli report .
the 2004-2005 enlargement round will be the cause of much satisfaction in many of the candidate countries , but there will be disappointment in those that remain outside .
secondly , the new state &apos;s adhesion to the Cotonou Agreement opens up new prospects for development cooperation and relations with the European Union .
in 2004 , the Lithuanian , Slovak and Bulgarian Governments made commitments in their accession treaties to gradually shut down some of their nuclear reactors .
to attain that longed-for European Union , we need to overcome the current weakness of the common policies other than EMU and CAP .
in a country where almost every citizen relies on government aid , we can help find the rice and the wheat flour that stand between Iraq and starvation , and the soap that guards against devastated public sanitation .
I have to tell the Commissioner that we still have work to catch up on , and there is something to which we should perhaps give priority , in that you still owe us information on the figures and the recovery of funds , which we have not as yet been able to get a grip on .
Algerian women should lead civil and political society in that country .
a number of Member States took a view opposite to the approach of the Court of Auditors and the European Parliament .
on this point I personally do , in fact , agree with the Swedes that it has proved that , when there is a market , then it is all too very easy both to create an acceptance of the fact that this activity can take place and also , of course , to make things easier for the criminals .
I would ask the European Commission and Member States to undertake a radical overhaul of their policy .
this could bring a breath of fresh air by improving discussion and public information and will , I think , make those who want a repeat performance of what happened during previous scandals think twice .
amendment 15 talks of how genetic diseases should be avoided and eradicated through measures such as genetic counselling and the selection of embryos .
this Commission must now operate internally as a coalition between these three movements and these three political parties and must try to reach compromises supported by the entire Commission and by the entire College .
so in this resolution on Albania we have sought to condemn - as we should condemn - those who have tried to manipulate this situation for their own reward .
that is a difficult task for Mr Kinnock , however , because words are not enough .
Mr President , my focus , and that of my contribution , will be on the main aspects of restructuring .
Madam President , before we begin voting I should like to say what I think about all the amendments proposed by Mr Caccavale on behalf of the UPE Group .
we are against reflecting in future Community resources the principle of dealing at national level with the consequences of policies decided at Community level and we are against calling on the peoples to foot the bill twice .
I would like to say how pleased I am to see Parliament conclude its first reading on the two long-term plans for anchovies and horse mackerel .
alongside the recognition given by this report - and also the statements made by senior EU officials , in particular the Commission President - we cannot fail to be concerned about the legal proceedings brought against the AK Party .
but they also need the revenue that comes from the Coca Cola Cup .
finally , it is important that human rights must not be a matter just for our ministers of foreign affairs , but for all government bodies .
this is why we have made our approval of this report dependent upon whether the support level for producers of long-fibre flax will be double that for cereal .
why are they outstanding ?
that is even true for countries that have not indicated that they wish to go to stage 3 of economic and monetary union .
in fact , as stated in this report , Montenegro has been making a number of reforms , particularly the creation of a new legal and constitutional framework , and in the fight against corruption .
secondly , Commissioner , I must say that there is disquiet in certain European regions and some of your replies do not provide any comfort , although it is true that we are in a context of a very rapid dialogue .
the will to harmonise by pooling all efforts , by exchanging best practice in the interests of citizens and the environment , with - not to be forgotten in this somewhat eclectic list - substantial extra financial support in order to implement the priority trans-European transport projects as quickly as possible .
the importance of the proposal lies in the serious consequences that tax fraud in the EU ( estimated to exceed 2 % of GDP ) has on Member States &apos; budgets , on the principle of fair taxation , which is weakened as a result of it , and on the operation of markets , because competition is distorted .
I hope that Sir Leon Brittan and the EU delegation will do everything possible to ensure that these social , core labour standards and environmental standards are indeed incorporated .
labelling may not be an instant solution , but , over time , it is proved by the US experience that it has an effect and brings down foetal harm .
I think we should wait for the results of the Cotonou Article 96 consultations , and it would also be good , Ms Isler Béguin , to wait for a delegation to go there .
it was clear that the majority of Ukrainians had chosen Mr Yushchenko and not Mr Yanukovych as their President .
Mr Moorhouse has informed me that he has joined the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party .
it is proposed that there be a ban on the second group of phthalates in connection with some , but not all , toys intended for children under three .
holding the European Year of Lifelong Learning and Training was an important step and a symbolic moment in raising the awareness of the European people with regard to this new state of affairs .
the next item is the joint debate on :
for example they are surrounded by considerable uncertainty and they may quickly become outdated if the external environment changes .
my country , for example , only issues negative travel advice on Beijing , Hong Kong and the Guangdong province .
as has been pointed out this afternoon , it is just that it is difficult to determine exactly how large and important the need for food aid really is .
Morocco is the first , but there are more to come .
some countries joined the coalition , some did not .
that is why I really must take it as a compliment when you say that it runs counter to Berlin .
it is therefore important that this difficult situation is dealt with in a responsible manner by the EU .
voting time
you have also succeeded in ensuring that all the main groups can identify with parts of the text and in obtaining the majority that we both wanted for this directive .
I am going to talk about petitions .
these corrections will be struck from the Minutes .
thus Europe is not keeping its own house in order and it is not doing what it ought to be doing in terms of balancing the international economy .
B5-0141 / 2003 , by Mr Van den Berg and others , on behalf of the PSE Group , on the situation in Venezuela ;
I believe that this directive , this compromise , will then have been sufficiently improved for us to jointly adopt it as a compromise before the end of this parliamentary term .
we are becoming accustomed to important matters - it is always important matters - ever more frequently reducing or doing away with the time available for questions .
I was taken to Falcone-Borsellino airport in Palermo by the leader and representative of the Sicilian division of the Pensioners &apos; Party , Mr Mario Collesano . While we were talking about the report on the European Development Fund , he advised me not only to vote for it but also to ask Parliament what happens to the funding for development , for we know that the money invested in the development of the regions of southern Italy , for example , has left Brussels and Strasbourg but has never reached the European citizens of Sicily , Calabria or the regions of southern Italy , or the European citizens of many other regions whose development is lagging behind , for that matter .
this is a serious fight .
that means using multilateral and bilateral channels and complementing the more formal medium to long-term policy instruments with political contacts and with joint trade diplomacy .
( A5-0208 / 2001 ) by Mr Sterckx , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive establishing a Community monitoring , control and information system for maritime traffic &#91; COM ( 2000 ) 802 - C5-0700 / 2000 - 2000 / 0325 ( COD ) &#93; ;
it has now turned out that Europe &apos;s growth is limited due to a lack of lanthanides , in particular , samarium and neodymium , which are needed for the production of high-energy permanent magnets and which are used in wind energy and to power electric vehicles .
it is with great disquiet that I see America put in the dock - around the world , not just in Europe - and so what I ask of us all is that we discuss these things in a right and proper way with our American partners and friends .
it is also right to deal with this matter at European level .
in conclusion , we hope to achieve a balanced approach which takes account both of the completion of the internal market and also of cultural differences .
our voters know when we are speaking half-truths and if we are not showing clear conviction .
you say , &apos; early warning &apos; , but no European authority gave us an alert , and certainly not those clowns on the Standing Veterinary Committee , an example of whom we had at the committee of inquiry in the form of a Danish lady who irritated even the most pro-European .
EGNOS is GPS compatible but it will offer more possibilities when Galileo becomes operational in 2013 .
Greece , Spain , Portugal and Ireland have recorded strong growth .
this is all the more dishonest , since the affair quite clearly also has an EU dimension .
once again , the wishes of the Chamber have been disregarded . Democracy only exists on paper : it is not applied within this Parliament .
in the context of the Budget , we try to husband our resources carefully .
I welcome this proposed strategy looking at the connection and links between environment and health and I welcome the Commission &apos;s proposal .
at the moment , fifteen Member States ban the trade in dog and cat fur , but there has been no general ban in the other countries until now .
I therefore welcome any initiative which enables us to provide financial assistance to these highly efficient businesses , for one of the biggest problems facing small entrepreneurs is the generally poor availability of own capital .
I think this is a good result .
this exclusion does not relate only to material factors but also to education , health or security in old age , and is passed on from generation to generation .
for some of us , female and male , these constitute a necessary instrument , and thus we feel the point must be made that the European Union ought to follow the Norwegian example of applying measures to increase the numbers of female board members of public utilities to at least 40 % , and use regulations to impose a 40 % quota of female representation on boards of private companies .
withholding US assistance from any organisation that in any way refers to abortion has already significantly increased the risk of unplanned pregnancies , sexually transmitted infections including HIV / AIDS and death and injury due to unsafe abortions .
in answer to my fellow Member who spoke previously , we stress that Articles 149 and 150 of the Treaty are the right legal basis for the proposed recommendation simply because they allow for lifelong learning .
at least 50 % of these acts of violence are carried out by the victim &apos;s husband or partner .
that , too , should be made clear , as these provisions in the negotiating mandate show that the EU currently lacks the capacity to cope with enlargement in view of its financial possibilities .
I would like , first of all , to thank all those who spoke in the discussion for their extraordinary support .
the conclusions of the last General Affairs Council send out a very clear and very firm message both to the rebels and to Khartoum regarding their own responsibility .
the Framework Agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission on their future cooperation also leaves many questions unanswered .
a miserable experience which also costs a lot of money .
a further point concerned the taking of concrete measures in connection with combating organised crime . These included more operational powers for Europol , a European police college or more stringent measures to combat money laundering , and cooperation with the candidate countries , for these are very often the countries where organised crime originates .
.
the Commission supports the doubling of the limit for calls of foreign reserve assets by the ECB to the extent that these further calls serve to replenish holdings of reserve assets up to the initial limit of EUR 50 billion fixed in the ESCB Statute &quot; .
the implementation of these plans is kept under constant review .
we are saying that this is a peace-keeping and humanitarian effort .
that concerns Amendments Nos 6 , 19 and 22 .
it would not be possible to exchange knowledge without the relevant infrastructure , because it plays a key role in establishing an effective environment for carrying out up-to-date and extremely necessary research .
Mr President of the Commission , for the coming term to be successful a major political problem needs to be settled : what will the role of the Community ’ s executive power be ?
we can and must take action .
we also hope that it will be possible with regard to the establishment obligations to achieve a clear change of emphasis regarding the payment obligations .
does the Luxembourg Presidency intend to pursue the adoption of the Philoxenia programme designed to assist European tourism during its term in office ?
he was told that he could no longer serve underdone beef because Brussels had forbidden the serving of underdone beef .
the Commission is fully involved in this work .
this reform must standardise Member States &apos; compliance and enforcement regimes , as there is no uniformity throughout the EU .
I assume that the Commission does not object to dealing with the problem in this way .
as you know - and this also concerns other discussions today in Parliament - the Treaty of Amsterdam rejects any kind of discrimination , as will any future treaties .
– Mr President , Mr Frattini , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to commend Mr Brejc on his outstanding report .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
we could go to a country such as Equatorial Guinea and see that the Commission delegation there is the Commission of the European Communities and not that of the European Union ; we can listen to our representative in the United Nations and notice that he or she is from the European Communities and not the European Union , or , we see that a commitment made by a united Europe to very speedily endorse the Kyoto Protocol is not in fact endorsed by the European Union but the European Communities .
to solve this situation , we do not need a new type of nuclear power station , but rather a recovery plan for the affected area , alternative ways of generating energy , as well as energy-saving measures .
do you agree with his proposal ?
where safer substitutes exist for substances of very high concern , it is imperative that the former replace , and are substituted for , the more harmful substances .
the Commission has made a clearer commitment in this regard .
it is a direct provocation to the strong and sceptical opinion in Europe which rejects a united states of Europe .
for this reason we can only agree with the objective of the Hungarian Presidency of making the integration of Croatia one of its highest priorities during its term .
Mr Haarder , we were referring in our question to the death in prison of Juan Ondó Nguema , but , sadly , we must now add that on 31 August another political prisoner died in the Black Beach prison , Juan Asumu Sima .
I would like to remind every one of us of the role that the institutions should have and ask them not to confuse their respective roles .
however , for the time being we must wait for the result of the national studies and the contacts we will manage and follow up .
( DE ) Madam President , I should like to ask that we reject the request for urgent debate .
lastly , I have to say that we all recognise that this &apos; safety net &apos; initiative to compensate the fall in income suffered by farmers and producers of both sexes in times of crisis is a great success .
that means that those who accept credit cards in a shop would have to learn 8 , 10 or even more different security markings , but no-one does .
Mr President , since physical aggression against a member of my group has actually been applauded in this House , I must say , Mr President , that I would have welcomed a word of solidarity and sympathy from you for the victim of this attack , namely our colleague Freddy Blak .
the vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
we are speaking about the use of funds for specific programmes under the 7th Framework Programme for research and development .
research must be encouraged .
on average , a fifth of disposable income is spent on food and drink .
normally this Parliament is consulted on a Commission proposal .
the Commission &apos;s inspectors may not , on their own initiative , exercise powers of inspection conferred on the national inspectors . &apos;
I therefore wish , from this position and in the time available to me , to express my surprise at the blunt statement by the representative of the Spanish Government of the time that , in the event of a similar accident to the , they would again decide to remove the ship from the shore .
but this is the deplorable truth about the situation in a country that has fallen back to medieval , primitive brutality in the attempt to suppress its own people - a people that longs for democracy , liberty and reform .
in addition , the current situation in Georgia makes it imperative that the Member States really do press on seriously with a common foreign energy policy , with energy diversification .
this is why I welcome the fact that 5 000 representatives of civil society have registered to attend the COP 16 proceedings .
Mr President , I would like to start by thanking Mrs Emilia Müller , and Mr Corbey and Mrs Roth-Behrendt too , for the courage they have displayed , despite the immense , absurd amount of pressure to which they have been constantly subjected by people with no scientific knowledge and no integrity .
the fixing of temporary quotas , though perhaps attractive in the short-term , is not the answer .
Mr Barroso delivered a strong and forceful speech to this House in July in which he told us that he would not obey the wishes of Mr Chirac or Mr Schröder .
this fact does not only render the proposal for an unconditional 30 % reduction unrealistic - and we strongly oppose it - but also leads many independent observers to hypothesise an increase , even a significant increase , of global emissions by that date .
it is therefore extremely important to provide , essentially , for consumers to be given a simple , coherent , reliable and effective legal framework that can be implemented regardless of the nature of the commercial practice in question .
it is good that today is not the only chance to do this , and I am delighted that we shall have an opportunity to continue this discussion about our plans and the problems informing our decisions over the coming week in the relevant committees of this House .
perhaps you can confirm whether that is also your understanding .
Mr Andersson is right , employers must have the responsibility for preventing harassment in the workplace , not colluding with it , or practising it .
although the text also lays down a range of clearly defined technical requirements , I am not pleased that unlike the Swiss railways we talk about penalising rather than efforts to satisfy the demand for a transport service .
today , people are perhaps going to die in France .
while we still face considerable turbulence in some segments of the sovereign debt markets of certain countries , we have been able to contain the sovereign debt crisis and protect the ongoing economic recovery in Europe .
the text states that travelling abroad to receive treatment could , in particular , benefit patients who are on long waiting lists or those who are unable to find specialised healthcare .
in principle , it is questionable whether the flexibility instrument can be used for these known needs which exceed the budget amounts for that section .
owing to the politically unstable situation in the country and the civil war , not one Member State recognises the Taleban government .
but since then , little has happened with the results of Rio .
Parliament and the European Union must adopt clear and unequivocal positions to condemn terrorism , but such positions will only have credibility when they condemn the terrorist policies of the Israeli Government and when those positions lead to concrete political and diplomatic measures , such as suspending the association agreement with Israel .
we congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs Fraga Estévez , and harbour the legitimate hope that this regulation may be a significant breakthrough towards a Mediterranean that is careful to preserve its fish fauna , but is also the source of livelihoods and employment for thousands of European fishermen , who , up to now , have only been required to observe bans and limits , whilst for the non-European fleets the Mediterranean has been a kind of free zone .
the European Parliament and its Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport have barely played any part in setting targets for education and training .
and Amendment Nos 1 and 2 propose deleting it from the list again .
 
I will , however , respond to it in the interests of transparency .
in this context , the Council would like to remind you of its decision 92 / 421 concerning a Community action plan for tourism .
the &apos; Customs 2000 &apos; programme is in no way intended to interfere with the organization of the public authorities or national administrations or to intervene directly in the area of customs cooperation strictly speaking , a sector in which , under Title VI of the Treaty , the Commission has no power of initiative .
I would just like to say one sentence about the EU 2020 strategy . Mr Barroso , you made absolutely no mention of the failures of the Lisbon Strategy .
I would say that what we have seen are more than irregularities : the trial was a farce and should be declared null and void .
unemployment rose to 13 million , and the situation with public finances got worse , rather than improving .
Madam President , Prime Minister Rasmussen , Commissioner Verheugen , after the Copenhagen Summit there is every reason to congratulate and thank Denmark , and above all her Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister , Mr Møller , and former Member , Mr Holter , on and for the smooth and steady advance of the Danish presidential term from start to finish , but mainly on account of their success in the enlargement negotiations that required such precision .
I firmly believe that for most of the time by far , women are much more worried about poverty , health concerns , education , the value placed on their work in the family and other circumstances in their lives .
in practice , it will only be accountable by means of &apos; an open and transparent communication policy &apos; , which is unlikely to lead to very severe sanctions by the &apos; general public &apos; ...
if it is established , the performance reserve - at least as it is in the Commission &apos;s current proposal , with a figure of 10 % - will in practice be a political instrument that is unnecessary and even counterproductive .
President-in-Office of the Council . - I was not exactly sure about the question .
ultimately , much of the credibility of Europe &apos;s common foreign and security policy depends on the European Union &apos;s military capacity .
although almost 70 % of the population of Lithuania live in cities and suburban areas , my country nevertheless lacks a clear , integrated and sustainable approach .
my personal thanks also for this important element after a year of very difficult and very complex negotiations which necessitated the intervention of the President of the Commission .
the problem of trying to put emphasis on one part is that progress on a piecemeal basis is not always permanent and often leads to a situation in the near future where there is a regression from any advances that have been made .
moreover , the decision to transfer a sentenced person to another country to serve their punishment depends on the likelihood of better conditions being provided for their social rehabilitation .
is this what you call free speech !
on this point , too , I need clarification from our rapporteur .
the evidence of the court is that that is happening now and it points to steps which can be taken now to alleviate the problem .
specific measures should be taken to stop women who are vulnerable on account of a disability or their status as immigrants from falling into precarious situations , and to facilitate their integration into society .
it was with a great deal of attention that we heard you , Mr President , saying that you wanted to consolidate the legal framework as a whole , for your acknowledgement of the need for a legal framework marks a great step forward , and your wanting now to consolidate it is an indication of your desire for a broad-based rather than sector-by-sector approach .
I would like to hear the Commission say something about how this part of the negotiations is going , as I know there has been a certain amount of resistance with regard to this area .
whole communities could be contaminated overnight .
the result has been an absence of reliable and comparable data , as well as insufficiency in short- and long-term action plans .
there is always national legislation as well , and these are primarily questions for national legislation also , but that is a question we should certainly look at .
this is something which concerns me as a member of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy and as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Petitions .
report ( A5-0032 / 2001 ) by Mr Bowe , by the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee , on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms and repealing Directive 90 / 220 / EEC &#91; C5-0685 / 2000 - 1998 / 0072 ( COD ) &#93;
the European Community will need to carve itself a role in the increasing cooperation between Member States in collating data and exchanging expertise and best practices .
I admit that the discovery of the note by a Commission official of October 1990 , which appeared to lend credence to the theory of a disinformation strategy , did cause me great concern - a concern which I made clear to you , moreover , at the time of my last appearance before the European Parliament , in Brussels in May .
Lüttge report ( A4-0057 / 99 )
the debate is closed .
at the meeting , participants expressed their support for the presidency proposals for the types of problem the group should address .
since these areas of policy are pursued at Community level , the Commission and Parliament have a major role to play in them .
no .
I look forward to solutions in these areas and also share Mr Rasmussen ’ s view that solutions must be sought in cooperation with both sides of industry .
Europeans are asking if our priorities and policy are correct and , in particular , for example , if an expensive battle with climate change is more important than the fight against poverty .
for this is what is needed now , to present an ambitious package of reforms alongside the specific measure for Greece .
the Commission in particular has been humiliated .
in the report we also made no secret of the fact that Slovenia and the Czech Republic had made less progress and that they really needed to speed up the process .
if it is law , we shall respect it as such .
the Commission commends the decisions taken by President Habibie , seeking to reform the political landscape of Indonesia and hold elections in 1999 .
Mr President , you said last weekend that you were not ready to put your European flag back in your pocket , and indeed we have seen that you have raised it under the Arc de Triomphe next to the French flag .
for the Commission proposals to be successful three factors will be crucial .
finally , there is a lot of demagogic twaddle about a superstate .
I believe that what we are asking of the President of the European Council , who will remain in office for two and a half years , is not to shout louder than others or to assert his authority more than others but to persuade others to speak with one voice .
( RO ) I would like to mention the e-Government systems which have already been developed in different Member States to implement the following types of applications : payment of taxes via electronic means , as well as payment of VAT via electronic means , or initiatives such as e-Invoicing .
all of these weapons represent a serious threat to international peace and security .
the greatest problem and difficulty for me , as rapporteur on the budget of the European Parliament and the other European institutions , is the uncertainty as to the fate of the Lisbon Treaty .
in the Nordic countries , we obviously do not have the same problems as in the Mediterranean area .
the European Union played a major part in the successful conclusion of this conference , ensuring that the latest scientific recommendations of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change were given due consideration .
China , however , is not bound by an international agreement on climate , and , as a developing country , does not have to be .
we need to ask why the site has not been cleaned of toxic waste and continues to pollute the water the surrounding communities rely on .
the joint debate is closed
Mr Peterle knows full well that , if the chapters in Croatia &apos;s accession process are to be unblocked , a bilateral solution must be found to the Slovenian-Croatian dispute .
this is despite the fact that a two-year transitional derogation period has been allowed after the entry into force of the directive ; despite the fact that , at the end of the two-year derogation period , the Commission is to review the availability of reliable safer alternatives that are technically and economically feasible for use in such instruments ; despite the fact that barometers that are genuine antiques , i.e. more than 50 years old , would be exempt from this directive ; and despite the fact that , if the compromise agreement in respect of barometers falls through , the whole legislative proposal effectively falls and has to go back to the drawing board .
there is a great need for the latter , but the two cannot be connected right now .
the coordination of national defence efforts , preferably within the larger framework of NATO , can do no harm .
we have to find an alternative to the bloodshed and to the continuation of this dispute .
often overwhelming hatred against the conquerors and oppressors filled the souls of those being wronged - this is how Hannibal and Mithidrates saw the Romans .
furthermore , we shall pay particular attention to developments in the economic and social situation and shall take all necessary measures .
we supported calls for moves to ensure free and fair elections and we also supported the calls from civil society for revised and updated electoral registers to ensure that maximum participation would be possible within those elections .
Mr President , I shall do my best to say what I have to say in the two minutes I am allowed .
I anticipate the aid increasing all the time , and it would grow at a rate in excess of the general rate of inflation .
first and foremost for reasons of principle .
bilateral disputes are currently holding back Croatia &apos;s and Macedonia &apos;s chances of continuing along the path to EU membership as they implement the necessary reforms .
I would also like to thank you for emphasising , with your presence on 1 May 2004 at the celebration marking the enlargement of Europe on the Slovene-Italian border , the south-western edge of the former Iron Curtain , that the era of totalitarianism and a divided Europe was over .
I believe that bilateral free trade agreements bring with them the possibility of opening doors of that sort , and also have the potential to achieve greater multilateral rapprochement by means of bilateral negotiations .
in my opinion the report is also deliberately silent on the so-called Pole &apos;s Card problem , which breaches international law .
for this reason I believe that the term ‘ social economy ’ , which was once in common use , is inappropriate , as is our German term , literally ‘ subsistence provision ’ , which is commonly used to translate ‘ services of general interest ’ . What we want is the best service for our citizens .
.
we shall continue to emphasise the European prospects of the countries of the Western Balkans , in line with the Zagreb Process .
we must not allow facilities like the Hungarian Vértes Power Plant and the Oroszlány mine to close without carefully drafted and detailed plans .
the Irish Sea is already highly radioactive as a result of the emission of waste from Sellafield into the Irish Sea .
we must take care to ensure that any new irrigation schemes are properly designed , with concrete-lined channels and reservoirs , and droplet irrigation systems similar to those used by farmers in Spain .
( applause )
( SV ) Madam President , I want to begin by thanking Marco Cappato for an interesting report .
I can only assume that the Commission actually thinks that such competition should now also be encouraged between regions within Member States once EMU is in place .
Mr President , for us , the Members involved in the struggle to create and establish the European Environment Agency , nothing is more satisfying than the Collins report on the assessment and revision of that Agency &apos;s responsibilities .
in Strasbourg , beautiful administrative buildings stand unused for 80 % of the time .
in our view , the European Union should propose a de facto hierarchy of standards at international level , with which all countries must comply . In other words , it should recognise that business law or trade law cannot supplant the principles of environmental protection , public health and respect for the social rights of workers .
this is irrefutable , just like the massacres of the Christians .
texts of agreements forwarded by the Council : see Minutes
the meeting was an opportunity to confirm the determination of states to reform the system of financial regulation .
I shall be attending the Education Council on 29 November , and on that occasion we will be discussing the best way to follow up the European Year of Languages , because it is not enough to have launched an action and for that action to have been received with great enthusiasm on the part of the public ; this action also needs to be followed up .
they are matters that go to the very heart of the nation state and its responsibilities to its citizens in each case .
building this consensus in Europe is critically important .
yet the challenges now facing the EU cannot justify this underspend .
Mr President , the Prime Minster said that we should try for the four-fifths of Member States before the European Council would be able to – or should – discuss the crisis .
they were not people who became lost in the petty detail : they rose above the detail .
no .
the number of errors has fallen , but we have still not reached the &apos; tolerable error level &apos; .
( Mr President , Community law governs mergers and acquisitions on the internal market by creating a competition policy which is one of the main Community policies and also one of its earliest .
this balance is reflected particularly in the definition of minimum Community requirements , leaving it to the Member States and the social partners to adapt these to the specific situation in their respective countries .
at the same time , the Luxembourg Presidency managed during the European Council in Brussels to make the Lisbon Strategy more specific , but it really is a pity that it was not possible to name at this point the Member States which are not managing to promote this strategy .
Parliament &apos;s assessment is on the table ; my services have been working for several months and have maintained a constant dialogue with all the parties involved .
in accordance with the agenda , there now follows the debate of Mrs Auroi &apos; s report ( A5-0117 / 2001 ) on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , concerning the proposal for a Council regulation on the amendment of Regulation ( EC ) No 1251 / 1999 establishing a support system for producers of certain arable crops .
could I draw the President-in-Office &apos;s attention to the fact that the Commission made a case to the Council of Ministers in March 1995 and it included a proposal for aid for the establishment of bad weather unemployment funds .
a note on the importance of adopting strategies for reforming pension schemes at European and national levels , promoting full employment along with social rights which strengthen and reinvigorate state pension schemes by broadening their financial bases , by ensuring that employers comply with their financial obligations , and by enhancing pay-as-you-go mechanisms ;
that is the realistic response to events in the world .
the European Parliament expects the Commission , if appropriate , only to put forward draft legislation concerning the principle of ‘ one share , one vote ’ following the revision of the Parliament and Council Directive on takeover bids .
I would also like to say that the Horwitz circle , the circle of poverty and illness , cannot only be attacked on one front , and that , while it is true that it is necessary to increase the economic capacity of all countries in order to reduce diseases , it is also the case that we must deal with specific issues which will allow for research , facilitate access to medicines , achieve a different kind of cooperation and also call into question , sometimes , aspects such as intellectual property .
the White Paper analyses in some detail the way in which that overall target can be achieved , on the basis of the most reliable estimates available of the probable contribution from each renewable source .
( FR ) Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , the Lisbon Strategy is Europe &apos;s answer to the challenges of globalisation .
there is very great asymmetry not only in trade , but also in the fact that the Chinese are much more familiar with the European Union than we in the European Union are with China .
it arises from an amendment to our Rules tabled by just two Members of the European Parliament - Mr Schulz and Mr Poettering - who considered that this would facilitate the participation of Members of Parliament from across 27 Member States - as we will be in January - in positions of responsibility in Parliament .
after imposing structural adjustment policies on the country , through the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank , which destroyed its economy and created a catastrophic social situation , the US responded to last year &apos;s earthquake with a military invasion .
for years , a brutal junta has been terrorising the people of Burma , who live in extreme poverty .
to conclude , I once again thank Mrs Paulsen for the excellent work she has done on this file .
elsewhere , governments are called upon to review the differential impact of varying electoral systems .
the truth is that citizens expect to be protected by European legislation and they cannot understand why European legislation does not protect them in this respect .
we can learn from one another .
Ireland is the first Member State which is now seriously beginning not to meet its inflation targets .
in short , we have relationships with all these countries that are of the public , state , bilateral kind , but we ignore the fact of their Arab identity .
however , that also depends on the Member States giving their support , and you also know that , instead of the EUR 20 billion that we were hoping for under the 2007-2013 financial perspective , we only have EUR 8 billion .
the time has come to stop observing the poverty and the difficulties of our fellow citizens and to take concrete action instead .
this solution supports the extension of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union , Article 47 of which lays down that &apos; legal aid shall be made available to those who lack sufficient resources insofar as such aid is necessary to ensure effective access to justice &apos; .
I appeal to Members of this Parliament to stand firm as the Commission has done . After all , the Commission &apos;s proposal strikes the right balance .
I regard it as a preliminary to the debate we shall be having here in November on minimum guarantees for asylum , on which I am rapporteur .
I hope that we do not go on into the evening session in any event .
however , the German Government , which sat on the issue during its Presidency , clearly had other ideas .
you cannot lead people towards their destiny blindfold .
this must not lead us to forget the commitment we have made to the defence of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the ethnic minorities in Turkey .
in this context , I believe that it is urgent for the parties to apply the Agreement on Access and Movement , which was signed in November 2005 in Jerusalem , and I was present at is signature .
you yourself refer in your letter to presumed information , not to concrete facts , and both countries have already stated at the highest level that they have investigated and that , in their opinion , no CIA prisons exist .
millions of women throughout the world are still being circumcised or married off .
Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Staes for his report on the organisation of inspections in the field of animal nutrition and for the broad support that was also given to the Commission position by Mr Olsson , Mrs Klaß and Mrs Roth-Behrendt .
the main actions are being taken by national services , police authorities and national politicians . The European Union can support these initiatives , we can provide a certain legal framework , and we can make sure that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is respected .
we entirely support his proposal to push this through without any amendments .
violence against women takes various forms , from psychological repression and abuse to rape , sexual violence and the completely illegal and unacceptable ongoing trafficking and abuse of women by inhumane prostitution gangs .
this is not about denying Israel the right to defend itself against terrorism , but about our strongest condemnation and rejection of excessive courses of action that really have nothing to do with counter-terrorism .
organs are removed from prisoners to then be sold and transplanted without the consent of the person concerned or his family .
Christian Europe is losing the battle against a socialist and atheist Europe .
reports of the implementation measures will also oblige Member States to be very careful .
the Conference of Parties to CITES , currently being held in Harare , is attended by all Member States that are party to the Convention and the Commission is actively involved in the establishment of common positions in the spirit of the new regulation , on both precautionary and sustainable use principles .
in reality , new problems arise all the time .
in our resolution we urge the Cambodian authorities to allow for free and fair elections , allow freedom of expression , freedom of the media and religious freedom and more .
politically the European Union &apos;s fisheries and external and commercial policy must be linked .
Madam President , Europe needs to give itself the resources to match its ambitions .
this should also be the rule for Members of the European Parliament .
one matter that is very close to my heart is decentralisation ; in other words , political decisions being taken as close to the people as possible .
I have to say , Mr President , that I was surprised to hear Mr Baron speak of awarding so-called compatibility certificates when you consider he occupies a seat in this House whilst simultaneously holding a seat on the Madrid town council .
however , this advantage often turns into a disadvantage , because it creates communication difficulties between Member States .
despite the fact that another food shortage crisis is not foreseeable in the short term , it is likely that one will occur in the future , if we take into account the negative effects of climate change on agricultural production and the constantly increasing demand .
our action will have to focus not only on the pilot projects we hold most dear , but on all the other pilot projects : for example , relating to SMEs , to youth assistance – particularly as part of the Erasmus programme – and to aid for the poorest countries to promote vaccinations throughout the world .
I believe the parties can get to the endgame .
some of its points are highly positive , but there are others that I cannot agree with : for instance , that we should follow the example of tobacco advertising in the case of cars .
however , in my opinion , the strategic focus of our policy on REEs must be innovation , raw material efficiency and technological leadership .
on this level it is clear that the sum of ECU 47.5 million granted for the 1998-1999 period in no way does justice to our ambitions and even less still to those of the young people who are waiting impatiently for the time when they will be able to throw themselves into the adventure of solidarity .
the terms on which data is exchanged must therefore also be set at a particularly high level , since it is not just a matter of specific agreements with Australia and the US ; a number of other countries such as Korea and India also already want to have PNR agreements with us .
Switzerland will have to set up a national agency , just as we all have done in our respective countries , that will coordinate the implementation of the programmes at national level and that will be required to make a financial contribution to each of the programmes each year .
if the EU is to remain active and economically strong , the challenges that must be tackled head-on also include the ageing population , which threatens the financial viability of our social systems , and globalisation , which is a source of fear mainly for countries with high unemployment and which at the same time confirms how indispensable it is to launch the structural reforms .
from 1 May 2009 , the remit of the EGF has been expanded and it now includes assistance to workers made redundant as a direct consequence of the economic and financial crisis .
these members of my Group would like to see a few changes in future .
I would call for an end to this situation of exception .
written statements ( Rule 149 )
if codecision means anything at all , it means that there have to be changes in the way specific projects are developed .
it was significant that Mr Cem thought that he detected a change of position in Turkey &apos;s favour in the last Commission report , which described Turkey as a candidate and not - as it suddenly was in Luxembourg - a &apos; non-candidate &apos; pushed out in the cold .
just among ourselves , Mr Santer : does the fact that your European employment strategy is being interpreted as concurrent with their views and deserving of support precisely by the senior advocates of deregulation and cuts in social services not give you much cause for doubt and anxiety ?
I suppose the fact that the opinions of these committees are sought is some consolation , but in a general way this decision needs some sort of explanation .
just because Latvia is a new Member State and one of the smallest , that does not mean its complaints are less important .
yet at this time , when Europe &apos;s public finances are the worst in living memory , Parliament &apos;s Committee on Budgets is proposing that the payments be increased by 10 % - by 10 % !
at the talks in Oslo , Sweden argued that we should have restricted use rather than a ban . That is a disgraceful position .
that is what I am working for , and I also believe that it is possible .
true , the relative failure to establish an internal market in insurance is not due solely to the tendency to interpret the general good clause in a biased way . Problems in the internal operation of the undertakings themselves have also played a part .
the European Union has been for a long time Chile &apos;s first trade partner ; this agreement should further consolidate and increase our trade relations .
already made rootless by virtue of their exile , families must be able to benefit from education for their children and training programmes for young people in order to regain some stability , to promote their social and economic integration , and to encourage their possible return to their own country .
with the decision that the plenary sitting has now taken , i.e. to place the Napolitano report on the agenda , it is foreseeable that we shall neither be able to complete the discussion of the Pirker report nor therefore will we be able to vote on it today .
each country is normally obliged to protect the actions of its undertakings within the international sphere .
I also supported the report because I agreed with the rapporteur that this piece of legislation must be prepared in such a manner that in the future the railway network becomes efficient for all users .
that was mentioned by Mr Samland in one of our discussions : namely , we need to get an agreement between our institutions before the end of the year which says that if there is no interinstitutional agreement , the basis for Article 203 in the future will be the maximum amount of spend for the year 1999 .
Mr President , I will go through the debates in the order in which they were held .
I also wish to say to you , Prime Minister , that the fact that Mr Bonde is opposed to it is the best sign that this is a really good result .
the now notorious Article 8 which governs freedom of expression , or to be more precise the lack of it , is still being applied through other articles of the criminal code .
Madam President , the President-in-Office told us that we have granted vast amounts of aid to Albania and indeed over the past five years we have given that country 450 million ECU .
the Member States expect the Community to provide them with assistance in finding a solution to this problem .
the Israeli authorities responded to this criminal act by military action .
or to extend the current stifling TV regulations to all the other programmes which are broadcast via the Web .
Paul Wolfowitz has undermined the World Bank &apos;s moral authority .
the same thing happened this morning .
this common access point will be launched in 2008 .
the EU therefore believes it is important that the next round pays attention to issues relating to the social dimension of trade .
4 . Request for an opinion of the Court of Justice on the compatibility of the EU-Australia PNR agreement with the Treaties (
we do agree with the amendments that move in the direction of including biohydrogen in the scope of this directive .
France was , of course , more realistic , stating that the Council has another way of implementing the Stability Pact , thereby justifying its non-compliance , whilst advocating changes through what it called the ‘ enriching ’ of the Stability Pact .
all that is true , and the nice thing about it is that it is so free of ideology .
. Mr President , recent events in Belarus have mainly been observed in terms of the elections taking place in the country .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , just two very short points .
in writing . - ( FR ) I am pleased about the adoption at second reading and on the basis of the report by my Finnish fellow Member Mr Paasilinna on the Council common position for adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the European Institute of Innovation and Technology , the idea for which was launched by the President of the European Commission , José-Manuel Barroso , in February 2005 , and which has aroused a certain amount of scepticism as regards the added value such a facility can provide .
it is primarily up to the applicant countries to do their work properly , but it is clear that the quality and quantity of the aid provided is also a factor .
with regard to the parliamentary procedure , I would like once again to thank all of those who have acted and spoken , especially the rapporteur , because the majority of Parliament &apos; s amendments have been incorporated into the proposal accepted by the Council , in this case practically all of them , although with some modifications . I would also like to express my gratitude because an improvement on the initial offer of funds has been achieved .
the present and its problems always have a connection to the past that we need to know . In particular , when it is about human tragedies , which followed the greatest Jewish tragedy , that are , however , forgotten , since they are the tragedies of smaller nations , such as the genocide of the Romany or Chechen-Ingush people carried out during the Second World War , and the Chechen genocide last year was acknowledged by the European Parliament .
it is , however , important that standards of safety attained at Union level are so high that we can also demand the same from the applicant countries .
was this an indictment of the European project or a mid-term wake-up call to our political establishment ?
up to now , the recognition of the various licences for train drivers has involved a great deal of bureaucracy , but it is to be hoped that the EU-wide standardisation in question will eliminate these problems .
reducing the mortality rate among pregnant women and encouraging equal access to care and benefits when it comes to health in pregnancy and to reproductive rights are objectives that I vigorously support and that stem from the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development ( ICPD ) .
I was very pleased with her reply , because even before I asked the question the Commissioner gave me her assurance here that the countries in the front line of European monetary union , which will therefore be adopting the euro , will not be at a disadvantage in terms of the cohesion fund and that the fund will be maintained .
I would like to congratulate the House , on behalf of the Commission , for recalling that the precondition for achieving this objective is the independence of the Central Bank .
does the President of the Commission fear that Laeken will be a failure ?
here I am thinking especially about the younger generation .
our objective has been a more comprehensive and forward-looking European policy towards India , and this is taking shape .
but , while taking account of that and of an amendment which was adopted , we are rather surprised that there were so many votes for and so few votes against and abstentions .
if that is the case , if people are locked up , or transported illegally , on European soil without any judicial trial , then the EU ’ s very core values are at stake and the question arises of what we intend to do about it .
this state of affairs is unacceptable from an environmental point of view .
I do not begrudge anyone their salary - that is not the point at issue - but Argentina has an enormously inefficient system , and if it does not sort out its home-grown problems itself , as its neighbour Brazil has made a start on doing , then we Europeans can do nothing either .
instead we feel it would be beneficial if it were made clear within the structures of the financial perspective that different instruments are available for foreign policy and also for development aid . At the same time , by guaranteeing the financial envelope in the legal basis , we would ring-fence the funding , making it impossible for the synergy gains to trigger a reduction in the resources available .
let us not fall into the trap of turning this into a test for good behaviour .
finally , it also deals with economic policies &apos; contribution to social sustainability .
although , admittedly , we should point out that the Commission &apos;s report has work matters at its core , it takes no account of many other issues and difficult situations which women encounter and we have therefore tried to incorporate them into this Parliament report .
of course we all know that the frontier regions , the regions that are at present situated on the borders of the European Union , will profit in the long term from the enlargement of the EU , because they will at last be frontier regions no longer .
what would be the point of enlargement without a real European foreign policy , without what is already defined in the programme as an external identity for the Union - marked by coherence , effectiveness and visibility - without the possibility of a close link between security , defence , trade and economic relations capable of being a vehicle for a European policy equal to the challenges of the modern world ?
prevention and increased supervision and control are in fact necessary in the Member States .
finally , the report should have suggested that the Commission examine the possibility of prior European Securities and Markets Authority ( ESMA ) approval of all &apos; structured financial products &apos; .
pamper yourself ; have it all ; buy .
on this same subject of individuals and freedom of movement , I should also like to say how much I agree with what has been said by some Honourable Members , to the effect that so far much greater progress has been made with the free movement of capital , goods and services .
however , it can be estimated that at least a half of the ECU 38m made available to the ALTENER programme between 1993 and this year was allocated to biomass .
there are just two things I want to say .
the most striking example is perhaps its silence on NATO / USA / EU initiatives in relation to Africa , such as the creation of specific military commands ( USA / AFRICOM ) , the holding of military manoeuvres ( NATO ) , or the growing military presence of the major EU powers ( &apos; peace support mechanisms &apos; , military missions ) .
in writing . - ( SV ) This report calls for yet more financial resources for area after area within the EU , while in the Member States , savings need to be made in areas such as healthcare , schools and social care .
Mr President , this is the second time that I have sat in this Chamber and seen the President interrupt one of the speakers on the basis that they are speaking too quickly .
finally , whilst the fight against terrorism is , of course , an important one , I cannot shake off the impression that we are at risk of losing sight of reality in this matter .
I think that technical need should not be recognized simply because one manufacturer demands it when all the other manufacturers demonstrate that another approach is entirely possible .
one of the most challenging tasks is what I would describe as the changing relations between , on the one hand , the majority group and , on the other hand , the Roma and the Chinese community .
the motion for a resolution before Parliament criticises the Commission for not informing and consulting Parliament sooner .
could I also make the point that it is extremely essential that we introduce legislation to provide legal certainty for those in the Member States who provide social services of general interest ?
the next item on the agenda is the joint debate on the following reports :
secondly , there is Article 191 , which states that European political parties are an important factor for integration . Thirdly , at the same time , we still have no idea what European political parties actually are .
particular attention must be paid to small and medium-sized enterprises which have a huge economic impact on the European economy .
liberalisation of energy markets
Europe is never going to starve , whatever the price of food is , because we basically have money to pay for it , but many parts of the world will .
at the same time there has been an increase in outstanding commitments , which now stand at EUR 11 billion .
to me , therefore , coherence is a fundamental issue which we must not leave out of this debate .
above all , however , it is also being conducted to the detriment of wages .
this includes the OTC derivatives , but it also includes other points , and we all know that this is only part of the financial market regulation , not all of it .
can you confirm whether that will be the case ?
this is not so much about learning from what is happening before our eyes but about taking action against those Member States who are guilty of not submitting to the obligations of a text that now constitutes a vice that is holding back economic revival in an unsustainable way .
secondly , we very much need to make means of payment such as credit cards more secure .
my experience from all the group visits and meetings is that the minority &apos;s fifteen points correspond much better to the attitude of the majority of voters .
moreover , Russia does not currently receive Community loans , and the lending mandate of the European Investment Bank for countries outside the European Union does not extend to Russia .
we do not consider that issues concerning environmental legislation should be placed under the co-decision procedure .
for this reason , recital E of Mr Duff ’ s report should be interpreted in the sense that the President of the Commission has to be consulted in good time , thereby giving him the opportunity to be heard , and for any comments he has to be accorded due consideration .
I share the view that this work should be completed in 2008 .
that is why I thought it was important that we should express an opinion on it .
transport safety is now at the top of the political agenda of the fifteen governments of the European Union .
is there a connection with mass unemployment , with the policy of diminishing solidarity and fiercer competition that we have been pursuing for the past 15 to 20 years ?
the CESR will draft its proposals on the basis of broad public consultation .
as part of this , the European Union certainly intends to enhance its role , with the assistance of the United States , Russia and its partners in Arab countries , in order to work towards finding a long-term solution to the Middle East conflict .
the Bowles report offers different remedies .
however , we await proposals from the Commission that will assure us that the same requirements will be applied to imported meat .
in the course of the negotiations , and if necessary , the Commission could return to the Council asking for additional directives in order to conclude an agreement which fulfils the aspirations and interests of both parties .
if the Commission now introduces a long transition period , there is a risk that a long time will elapse before there is any action .
this is where the Commission have total double standards on what they impose within the European Union and what they allow into the European Union , for all that will happen is that people will go outside .
in the response to this debate from the Council and the Commission , I would like the joint strategy for these two countries to be explained more clearly , as we have to acknowledge , for example , that we have a thousand kilometre border in this region that cannot be controlled properly on either side , while the policies that we pursue on one side of this border will have direct effects on the other side .
I readily admit that we want European lists and European members of parliament .
thank you very much , Mr Commissioner .
meanwhile , the beleaguered dairy sector with dairy farmers suffering across the EU will receive a paltry increase of funding of only 0.3 % .
regarding the adoption of its common position , the Council would inform the honourable Member that this has been postponed to a later date at the request of a Member State , and this in order to give the latter more time to prepare a statement that will appear in the minutes of one of the forthcoming sittings of the Council .
I hope that this debate may bring them to their senses .
this is not a matter of party politics , as all political groupings in Bulgaria are affected by this .
it was launched in this Parliament to much acclaim and it was a total and utter crippling failure , even before the global recession hit .
as with all summits , the objectives set and the means of achieving them are two quite different things .
that is what the citizens of Europe want to know !
I am happy that Commissioner Piebalgs mentioned today this possible compromise unlike at the last meeting when we discussed electricity .
the policy is quite expensive by its very nature and that is how the participants mainly perceived this policy .
Mahmoud Abbas , for his part , does not pull any punches when it comes to setting out his demands faced with the Islamists .
we understand that it was not formally transmitted to the Member States in the Council .
Mr President , with regard to the fundamental issue , I must say that we support the Commission : we support it and we entirely disagree with some people &apos;s two-dimensional stereotypical view that there are either pro-free trade countries or protectionist countries in this field .
the social partners are called on to implement the principle of equal pay for equal work or work of equal value .
every time drugs are discussed in the European Union , tempers flare - this time between France and the Netherlands .
we will very closely follow the content and effective scope of this document .
rainfall is more erratic and we have more droughts causing life-threatening fires across our continent .
when possible and prudent , we stand ready to continue and expand cooperation in the future .
the European institutions , with the agreement and collaboration of the Member States , must be adapted to ensure that the commercial exploitation of pornographic pictures of children , the incitement to indulge in sex tourism and child sex abuse are curbed within the territory of the European Union and to ensure that the range of sanctions also includes penalties which deprive offenders of their freedom , as has happened in France in the last few days .
this role of ‘ ex-ante ’ political scrutiny played by Parliament would be the natural complement to the ‘ ex-post ’ political scrutiny , in the form of the discharge for the implementation of the budget .
the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Security and Defence Policy submitted an opinion to my report on ASEAN .
( the sitting was closed at 1.05 p.m. )
we must investigate without prejudice but without being blind to the possibilities .
we need to intervene in this matter .
it is quite a package that we have here .
it will only , as an amendment to an existing directive , be effective if the Member States concerned are willing to implement it effectively .
it is important for us to hold on to this framework consistently and as a matter of principle at all times .
again , this is unfortunate .
I believe that today we need more courage to show solidarity , but the forthcoming enlargement means that we need even more courage .
they are restricted from operating outside their local geographic area and provide mainly small amounts of credit for low-income members and for those in financial difficulty .
however , we hope that the work being done by Croatia to meet opening benchmarks will allow us to recommend opening negotiations on a further one or two chapters rather soon .
it is even a threat to driver safety .
as well as Article 152 of the Treaty , these policies comply with Article 21 of the European Union &apos;s Charter of Fundamental Rights , by prohibiting all discrimination - in this case on grounds of age - and Article 25 , stating that the Union recognises and respects the rights of the elderly to lead a life of dignity and independence and to participate in social and cultural life .
the report in its original form was more like the description of the Merovingian dynasty as despotism tempered by assassination .
it may not be the answer to everything , but it is an answer .
there are very distinct responsibilities and national and European federations have a fair share of responsibilities to shoulder in the system .
these are worrying statistics , and we are not even talking about other food-related illnesses .
in conclusion , it is important for the Council and the Commission to have the European Parliament &apos;s full support in this matter , which is critical for the international community and - as several of you also highlighted - for the future of Europe .
accordingly , we hope that the Convention presents the European Council with a draft Constitution that continues constructing a Union that is respected on the world stage as a body working for peace and solidarity , unlike the militarism that currently prevails .
it is irresponsible of us to allow such ignorance in this area , resulting in a great deal of popular disquiet as a result of the various misinterpretations , some of which we have just heard from various sides of the House .
that does not mean , and let me be quite clear on this , financing huge employment programmes at European level , nobody wants that .
the Alevites , accounting for more than 30 % of the population , are not fully recognised .
we need clearer labels to indicate where animal products are used to make a garment , in particular , in the case of fur and fur trim .
I still am .
this topic cannot be avoided because the European Union has a responsibility to protect children &apos;s rights while , at the same time , we are also seeing that the issue of adoption and , as a matter of fact , as its direct consequence , international legislation and international practice , blow certain rights out of proportion , making the adoption of children impossible and thereby curtailing their other rights .
these agreements are unacceptable , not only because they do not respect Community competence in this area , but also because they undermine the principle of fair competition and give rise to unequal treatment between nationals of various Member States where visas are concerned .
the Members participating in that meeting also asked for appropriate explanations regarding the draft of the Council common position .
the idea of introducing a common European public prosecutor should be scrapped .
it is not possible at this initial stage of the process of drawing up the Charter to prejudge its content in more detail .
furthermore , we are extremely frustrated not only that it is impossible to pursue a development policy but also that the infrastructures and institutions to which the European Union and its Member States have contributed in the past , not without some difficulty , have now been destroyed .
we can only hope , therefore , that the Council Presidency succeeds in giving the constitutional process new momentum , as there is no doubt that the individual rights of EU citizens belong to the substance of the Constitution ; the Charter is its core substance .
I therefore call on the Commission and the Member States to use the Structural Funds to reclassify buildings in environmental and energy terms , with this financing used as a catalyst for private funding .
I hope , Mr Foreign Minister , that you will be able to safeguard this trust in the constancy and reliability of German European policy in the future , for it is of importance to progress within the European Union and to the future of our European continent .
Madam President , in its recent report on human rights the US State Department called the situation in Colombia poor , and that is saying something .
why is Europe in Afghanistan ?
this budget therefore remains cautious , and that is good .
the citizens of Athens , for example , are very well aware of this .
Mr President , one of the most important results of the collapse of the Soviet Union was the creation of an independent Ukraine .
a huge amount of damage has already been done to consumer trust and consumer confidence in the recent past .
( PT ) Mr President , fundamental rights are the very backbone of all of the EU &apos;s political action .
we must never forget that every individual &apos; s childhood and the particular circumstances of their family and social circle in large measure determines their adult life .
most importantly , because there are no conditions , it allows the European Union to proceed , if it wishes - and I hope it does - by tabling a resolution in Geneva at the next session next year to redeem our failure last year : the CFSP came under a lot of criticism because we could not unite on this question .
this would be absolutely incredible or , at least , very naive .
for our part , while we are signing an important Trade , Development and Cooperation Agreement with South Africa , it does not seem politically acceptable to send a message of financial cuts .
this is an act adopted by the United Nations Security Council that the signatory States and the European Union - as representative regional power in some cases of signatory States - should support , but in which it cannot participate .
the information society forum , in which all these people mentioned by Mr Theonas work , is quite enthusiastic about the new possibilities .
I am therefore strongly arguing that , when we present this framework directive , we also at the same time immediately repeal the various vertical directives the water framework directive is a good example .
at the same time , however , European viticulture needs to adapt to the needs of consumers all over the world .
we are also seeing Serbs rallying round Milosevic in the name of their violated homeland - in spite of the fact that most of them once rejected him - and the manifestation of an orthodox sense of solidarity in their disapproval of the Atlantic military action .
the conclusion of this agreement helps to give the Union a vital and indispensable role in seeking an outcome to the crisis .
that is why I very firmly support minimum social standards at the European level .
Turkey has to improve its record first .
unconditional free trade dishonourably takes away jobs , ruins the environment , endangers consumer health and increases obstacles to accessibility , solely in order to guarantee the price of a product or service .
that is why this issue demands that amendments be tabled and resolutions adopted .
I wish Mr Fjellner all the best and would like to extend my warm thanks to my parliamentary staff , particularly Bent Adamsen and Dominykas Mordas .
all the other practical reasons , of which I am only too aware , may meet with objections , but not this one .
other groups have also been affected .
I would also like to extend this wish to your successor , Mr Rehn .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
the April parliamentary elections definitely deserve more than the benefit of the doubt .
this role of melting pot proved unsuccessful .
( RO ) Madam President , every year , 9 May is celebrated as Europe Day and I take this opportunity to extend my best wishes to all European citizens .
we must stop radically overhauling the rules of the game every three years .
we have abstained from voting on Amendment No 16 in order to support Amendment No 12 from our own group instead .
it is at this point that I would like to introduce a figure into the proceedings .
success means achieving substantial progress towards a stronger , more integrated Union , which will inevitably involve reducing the role and powers of each State , that is the problem , Mr Michel , and increasing the role and powers of the common institutions .
this is a problem best solved through communication and cooperation , but Europe &apos;s immigration and Schengen policies urgently require review , reflection and then sensible reform .
without a shadow of doubt the Energy Charter Treaty will promote cooperation between East and West , which is in the end in the interest of us all .
Mr President , what worries us most is the low degree of implementation of Structural Fund payments .
it is in competition between countries and companies to find effective solutions to environmental problems that creativity can flourish , not by bureaucratising our existence .
first , what Mr Gallou has been calling for is no different from the flag we have been flying , namely a decisive response to the problem of subsidy abuse .
let us give ourselves the chance to make progress .
here again , though , the value of the euro is not going to be determined by a political ukase .
Mr Evans , we are unhappy that the Socialist group supports the Council ’ s response .
we will continue our wide-ranging commitment in the country and will continue to speak plainly wherever international law and human rights are infringed .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , since the assessment we made in December of last year , the situation in Cuba has only worsened .
the classical function of the Commission would be to broker an agreement between the warring partners in a crisis .
will it stop the hatred ?
on this occasion , there has been a spectacular change in the contributions of the donors , with the European share increasing from 48 to 60 % , while that of the United States has dropped to 13.8 % , the lowest in the history of the organisation .
is Google abusing its monopoly by refusing to cooperate in this case and failing to take account of European legal regulations ?
we recognise the importance of maintaining European technological capability for space activity .
we , the Communist Party of Greece , oppose all these procedures and we shall stand with all our might shoulder to shoulder with the people fighting for their rights .
the car industry is supposed to be drawing up a voluntary code of advertising conduct but we have had our fingers burnt through voluntary codes and any such measure should be regarded with suspicion .
then households will of their own accord choose energy-saving light bulbs , car manufacturers will produce vehicles with low fuel consumption , property developers will build passive houses , energy producers will produce energy with low emissions .
the same happened on 3 May , but then there were seven instead of six .
Mr President , global capitalism moves people around the world - some legally , some illegally - as though they were simply expendable facts of production .
. – Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission would like to underline the fact that the state aid that has been recalled , because it is considered illegal and incompatible , is to be returned to the Member State in question and not to the Commission .
the second consideration must provide us with a methodology on which to base this second phase in the development of the area .
applause , calls of approval , beating on tables by Members
I rejoice to see all those here who are doing their duty rather than going about defaming and discrediting this House .
that to me is modest .
to create clarity once and for all , the Commission has asserted that it will bring forward a proposal to solve all these issues .
I would have like to have seen a specific disability directive that outlawed discrimination in access to goods and services and similarly one on age .
Madam President , terrorism is unacceptable .
we appreciate that there has been a delay .
Commissioner , reports from universities are not enough : the Commission &apos;s political responsibility obliged it to set out the effects of the previous reform before this Parliament in order to have an adequate debate .
it is for our Parliament – as we have already marked in a symbolic ceremony outside – a special and extraordinary moment .
it is therefore rank hypocrisy for the EU to continue to fund tobacco growers within Europe .
Mr Duisenberg , I remember last year &apos; s discussion on the 1998 annual report very clearly .
but we must respect the will of the people .
for the time being , we can operate in the east but not in the west , which is controlled by Gaddafi .
the first is that sustainable fisheries management must be based on a balanced range of measures , not only on the simplistic solution of fleet reduction , but also on a greater selection of fishing methods , on the proper use of the MAGPs and of the TACs and quotas .
in every country , those who pursue inflationary policies suddenly felt themselves to be affirmed and encouraged by what the President of the Commission had to say .
unfortunately , it does not give the impression of being a real political strategy on the part of the Commission .
nevertheless , like some of my fellow Members , I , too , wonder whether our response has been rapid enough .
for the time being , you are aware that the Council is still examining these two issues and that any possible solution must indeed be endorsed by your Parliament .
as the debate stands now , people are not yet ready to go any further .
thirdly , just as there are toll-free motorways so certain sections of the railway track must be free of charge .
we need to concentrate on the larger picture and never lose sight of the opportunities I have just described .
its action is decisive .
our farmers have been ground down and we must help them .
as Members of Parliament , we are extremely anxious about the way in which the Commission and Member States will handle this unexpected , but considerable windfall .
history clearly shows that countries which have taken part in world trade have enjoyed better growth than those which did not .
membership for Turkey will be a two-way process .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , taking the floor for the last time before this House , which I will be leaving in a few weeks &apos; time , I would like to address a few words to my fellow Members .
the problem is this : how do we deal with green biotechnology ?
without ignoring the social , political and economic problems which lead to racial discrimination in Europe , I would like to focus on one aspect - the development perspective - which has been somewhat forgotten in the stagnation of recent events and also during the Conference , in relation to the Middle East conflict and the seriousness of the events taking place there , and to the recognition of the suffering caused by Europe &apos; s history and the perversity of slavery and slave trading , the practice of which we today see as a crime against humanity .
.
( CS ) I do not share the enthusiasm for this text which generally prevails here .
who was powerful ?
it would then be possible to set targets for their protection and prevent the extinction of other species in the future .
this is a large-scale health problem , as we should bear in mind that forms of dementia affect not only those who suffer from them , but also those who care for them .
I could also mention Austria , which has not yet ratified Convention 138 , and Ireland , which has not ratified Convention 111 on non-discrimination .
however , it is in the relationship between public health and trade that Europe can make the biggest contribution in this area .
when some Members of this House , Mr Van Orden and Mr Tannock , talk about solidarity , they chiefly mean solidarity with the United States .
they only have organisations representing disabled people .
forty thousand people in the European Union die from air pollution every year , so there has been an unfortunate misunderstanding somewhere .
the reserves are there to meet future demand .
the present debate has perhaps given me , as a war child , a certain insight into how things were when the peoples of Europe were killing each other for values symbolised by rather more important things than chocolate .
the last point that was raised by several speakers and described by Mr Casini : the transparency register is definitely not a silver bullet or a magical solution to fight corruption .
once the structural funds regulations for the new period are in place the Social Fund will enjoy a new lease of life in view of the increased emphasis given to the employment dimension in all Community policies and in the Structural Funds in particular .
we want to exercise our right .
it is unfortunate that we were not able to obtain an answer before , but what is most unfortunate is that it was not sent through the usual channels according to the Rules of Procedure .
the review of Construction Products Directive 89 / 106 / EEC in this context is a much needed boost which should help the sector , specifically by removing barriers to trade for manufacturers , on the one hand , and by helping companies stay in business and workers remain in employment , on the other .
I should first of all like to say that I shall vote for it , but I have a few comments :
the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport was notified of the agreement only a few weeks before the negotiations with the American authorities .
we Greens welcome and support Carole Tongue &apos;s strong commitment to strong public service broadcasting that is able to provide social communication and cultural self-portrayal as important public goods on a permanent basis .
we are talking about a European Commission and a President of the European Commission .
the Summit has enabled major progress to be achieved in several areas .
as rapporteur of this GSM Directive , I believe that we have found the correct end solution , placing strategic planning for the spectrum at Community level within future multi-annual programmes of radio spectrum policy and linking it to the framework directive .
Mr President , Galicia &apos;s national poet , Rosalia de Castro , who always felt great solidarity with the fate of the Galician people , coined the phrase &apos; black shadow &apos; to express a sense of anguish that troubled her .
finally , the new agreement with the Republic of Moldova should be an association agreement as in the case of the other countries under the European neighbourhood policy .
in this regard we reiterate the need to ensure that each country is dealt with on its own merits .
can obstacles to the creation of functional blocks over European territory be identified openly ?
allow me to mention one last thing that I feel is particularly important , namely the inclusion of the major European ports in the planning of the TEN networks .
in Europe we had 1 400 different pieces of technical legislation on wireless systems in 27 countries .
it is a guarantee against what we call in English &apos; stuffing &apos; .
the European Ombudsman is independent and so we , as the Petitions Committee , do not interfere in the ongoing investigations of complaints .
I think there is one aspect that we are still arguing about , but I am sure we will get there and then we will have a good and important package .
it can be cured , it can be treated and millions of our fellow citizens can lead full and fulfilled lives if we ...
with the Seventh Framework Programme , and its four specific programmes , it will be possible to structure the European research area around ten main themes .
many companies have problems of profitability and restructuring is necessary .
with regard to the issue of educating people about the Holocaust and raising their awareness of it , I would just remind Mr Sacrédeus of the answer which was given to a written question from Mr Colom i Naval in March 2000 and which I know that you too have had the opportunity to study .
the Commission will endeavour to consult closely with these partners during the course of the negotiations .
it is a tragedy that you have not listened to Mrs Rühle .
above all , however , what concerns me in the report is the way in which the doubts about the Arab Charter on Human Rights are expressed , where it is stated that some of the provisions contained in the Charter are worded in such as way as to allow different interpretations to be made .
against the backdrop of the international financial crisis , the Commission proposes further reinforced solidarity with the Member States that do not yet benefit from the protective umbrella of the euro .
when this petition was put to the Commission , I believe the Commission behaved correctly .
I was voting against it .
this is why it is so important for entrepreneurs and employees to ensure that they upgrade their abilities , enhance their skills and improve professionally .
I was happy to note that in your opening speech you were prepared to re-examine this point .
particularly in the new Member States , it is absolutely vital to improve the urban environment by means of such measures .
Zimbabwe is the only African country in which the economy is in decline .
the implementation of the strategy on sustainable development must , as decided at Gothenburg , be based on four points .
it is crucial that we get regulation that ensures the responsibility and the legitimacy of the financial sector without suffocating innovation .
on a number of occasions , I have put the question to Commissioner Fischer Boel in this House , and each time she has reassured me that Commissioner Mandelson is staying within his remit .
on the basis of the Commission &apos;s evaluation , the application satisfies the criteria for eligibility as established in the regulations of the EGF and the institution has advocated its approval to the budgetary authority .
it is the first time I have heard about this .
firstly , the alleged state aid of Member States for their ports forms the root of the problem .
is it not true to say that Africa offers cause for concern on subjects which are much more serious and yet strangely enough these do not feature in the urgent debate !
he confirmed that he had been tortured .
considering that this is something like 48 % of the entire budget - EUR 38 or 39 billion - it is quite an achievement , spent over fifteen countries , that the budget was within two and a half per cent of estimate and that waste and the possibility for loss were lower than the average for the budget .
Madam President , I should also like to thank Mr Della Vedova for his report on the Commission &apos;s communications , on our general tax policy and on company taxation in the internal market .
we are convinced of the importance of tourism for employment and on the economy and want to know why and how the Commission is going to try and put pressure on the Council so that the programme can be approved next year .
Mr Ahern spoke of the asylum agreement .
however , it warns that there are irregularities and a lack of transparency in recruitment procedures , and the European Anti-Fraud Office ( OLAF ) has even opened an inquiry into the Foundation .
he mentioned the black grouse and the Iberian lynx .
if all parties commit to a speedy schedule , there is every possibility that the strategic guidelines for cohesion policy will be ready by October .
one of the results of these negotiations is supposed to be the end of export refunds , probably after 2013 , whereas we are discussing quotas for the next two years 2007-2009 .
two new revelations show how serious the situation is .
however , I have to say that in this House we have heard endless goodwill towards South Africa since the end of apartheid but there has been relatively little action , particularly on the trade and cooperation talks .
it is worth remembering , however , that trade policy alone is not the answer .
Ireland is thought by some to have rejected the Treaty partly on account of the Commissioner issue .
rather than lay out a wish list of every new policy or new idea , I want to touch very briefly on some of the points you raised and try to re-emphasise those within our role and work here in Parliament .
( the sitting was closed at 9.15 p.m. )
I am delighted to note that the decision to hold referendums is catching on .
I can agree to several of the proposals in the report .
in fact , subsidies have been paid for many years to associations with an allegedly ‘ European mission ’ without any legal basis . They are often concealed among the appropriations made under Part A of the budget , in other words they are merged , with the aid of creative accounting , into the administrative expenditure of the Commission .
Mr President , even if formally unexceptionable , within this Parliament , the interinstitutional declaration on democracy , transparency and subsidiarity is becoming very much open to criticism in terms of its ability to translate fine words into deeds .
since then , the positions of the Belgian Government and the Commission have become closer , but we have not yet reached final agreement on the price that the Commission would be willing to pay or on legal guarantees which are required by the Commission .
related decisions exist and have been taken in the context of the International Maritime Organization , but these proved insufficient .
– Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , from time to time , and only for a moment , Heads of State simply delude themselves , and I believe that one of their delusions is that they can simply say that they want the arms embargo on China removed .
at home , most of them want Moldova to become more open to the European Union .
I should like to close by saying that we need to strike a balance between animal protection , health and environmental aspects .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I have listened to the views of the honourable Members with great interest .
the Federal Constitutional Court will merely have to examine whether the entry criteria , as contained in the Maastricht Treaty and the appurtenant Protocols , are fulfilled .
at a meeting of the Temporary Committee investigating the Echelon affair , a senior official responsible for the encryption of confidential information said that he had always been on very good terms with the NSA in Washington and that they check our systems on a regular basis to ensure that they really are secure and are being used correctly .
does the budget tie in sufficiently with discussions with a social dimension within the European Union , such as those pertaining to consumer affairs , the environment and animal welfare ?
they pretend that they are intervening for a peaceful solution to the problem , in order to safeguard the interests of the European monopolies in Iran .
.This report , which is meant to be a response to the European Commission ’ s Green Paper on economic migration , is nothing but a long litany of dangerous and suicidal aberrations for the nations and peoples of Europe .
this includes conditions that go far back into history and attempt to revise it , particularly the history of the Second World War .
opinion draftsperson for the REGI Committee . - ( BG ) Madam President , Commissioner , colleagues , as the opinion draftsperson for the Regional Development Committee I would like to underline the significant role of regional and local government authorities in ensuring environmental protection and sustainable development .
I look forward to continued work with Parliament and its committees on this very important subject .
it is in that context in particular that we welcome you and your delegation here today .
Commissioner , I am glad you are dealing with this .
the Commission has very clearly indicated its sympathy with Parliament &apos;s position with respect to Article 202 .
however , tackling one of its consequences , piracy , is much more within our grasp .
finally , a word about Greece , because I hope Member States will also have the occasion to discuss at the highest level this situation , which is important not only for a Member State of our Union but , I believe , for the stability of the euro area and for the stability of the European Union as a whole .
recalling , then , the need for a clear and flexible legislative framework , I ask for compatibility and consistency between the frameworks regulating interconnections and access agreements .
the courage and foresight of the 1950s &apos; generation of politicians consisted of making progress , not with all European states , not even with all the states in the west , but with those which were ready and able .
I am not out to reject scientific discoveries , because life is synonymous with evolution .
the efforts of the government of Prime Minister Erdogan and President Gul at improving relations with Turkey &apos;s neighbours have been the most important aspect of Turkish politics recently .
the third is national taxation .
if we continue to allow thousands of tonnes of nuclear waste from the European Union to be exported to Russia , then we are taking upon ourselves a responsibility even and ever greater than that which – I emphasise , since it is not only now that the export is starting – we already bear for the lamentably poor state of the environment in the region around Mayak and Chelyabinsk and of the health of the people who live there .
social security should be developed more effectively .
since the subjects are connected , I would also like to take the opportunity as a French citizen to express my grave concern about the case taken to France &apos;s Constitutional Court in the name of non-discrimination , challenging the articles of the Civil Code that quite naturally enshrine the principle of marriage as the union between a man and a woman .
the fact that this principle of Member States &apos; competence is not expressly mentioned in the Constitution seems to us to reinforce it .
after the vote , I think we should all join forces , and I am addressing Mr Watson in particular , whom I ask , on behalf of my group , to stop his policy of aggression and unjustified slander of the other political groups and specific nationalities in Parliament .
why not extend sanctions to oil and gas , where the regime is making its core funding ?
( IT ) Mr President , Sudan is the largest country in sub-Saharan Africa , the crossroads at which the Arab and African worlds meet , as well as a mosaic of a great many diverse ethnic groups .
the BSE hearing concluded that the financing of the various consequences should be covered by the budget and / or charged to the Member State principally responsible for the spread of the disease .
all regions in Europe continue to need European Community initiatives .
organ shortage is a major challenge facing Europe .
creativity , innovative technology , and team spirit among the institutions , industry , the social partners and the research world are , of course , equally necessary .
you cannot table motions which aim to introduce this kind of automatic process and at the same time , in the committee meetings , emphasise the scope for political discretion in the granting of discharge , as Ms Theato tends to do .
we want no restrictions on countries , no restrictions on the types of medicines , nor any prior approval by an external authority .
we need standard national legislation throughout Europe which punishes Union citizens who engage in child sex tourism , irrespective of where the offence was committed .
I welcome these proposals as part of the wider financial services action plan which is so important for the future of the economy of the European Union Member States and could potentially deliver such great benefits to ordinary people across the European Union .
in the context of the current economic crisis , this is the most important challenge for all of us .
disasters of this nature that my country and other EU Member States have suffered lead me to join the rapporteur in calling for effective prevention measures , such as technological research and development and the establishment of a European Monitoring Centre for Drought and Desertification .
paragraph 7 comments on the Internet attacks carried out .
Albania is , after all , a secular country in practice .
the Council needs to take the Treaty of Lisbon on board , both from the point of view of the areas newly under the jurisdiction of the European Union , which are reflected in the budget , and from the point of view of the European Parliament &apos;s strengthened powers , not least regarding the budget .
this must be made clear and there should be no attempt to cloud an issue which is crucial to the economy and agriculture of the Azores .
I must congratulate the Commission on its clear presentation , which is why we had to reject the request by the Committee on Budgets to delete the stated aims from the appendix .
naturally , there were a few initial teething problems during this first year and some considerable discussion took place on the interpretation of the role of the Ombudsman according to the Treaty and the Statutes .
that is why this autumn the Commission will report on the enlargement process as a whole , to set up the debate at the December European Council .
the report presented today will not change our minds on that point .
if the sale takes place between private persons , resale rights do not apply .
that is without precedent in the history of Europe and the world .
several decades have now passed .
this is a denial of democracy .
that is why it is so important for us to support and back the numerous candidates in the communes , for us to ensure that fair local elections are held , for us to monitor efficiently , for us to ward off , prevent and correct any jiggery-pokery during registration .
my question is now as follows : what solutions , other than the opportunities in the eurozone that have been pointed out , do you envisage whereby , in spite of holding on to this Constitutional Treaty , we can secure what is contained in the Treaty with a view nonetheless to making further progress in this area ?
also , fiscal policy is now markedly more expansive than before as a function of the limits agreed under the Stability and Growth Pact .
I believe that the work done by the previous presidency in defining the financial outlook was excellent , regardless of who was involved in that work .
we all wish for and are seeking sustainable exploitation of the seas and that is why we all need to move in this direction .
that was a very common theme through many of the contributions here this morning .
one of the main objectives of this research is to investigate the possibility of switching from tobacco cultivation to alternative activities .
for this sector , as for service stations , there must be either an exception to the general rule or a sector-by-sector approach within the general regulatory framework .
over the last three years , prices for oil in US dollars have more than tripled .
one sour note is the fact that only now is Parliament being called on to deliver its opinion on the legislative proposal on this Agreement , when the annexed protocol relating thereto was adopted by Parliament itself in October 2005 as part of a separate procedure .
thirdly , and taking account of the disparity in levels of development between the two parties in the negotiations and , in particular , the well-known limitations in terms of the ACP countries &apos; capacities , I wish to state that we must have studies on the predictable impacts of the new agreements on their various options and at various levels drafted and , if they are already drafted , presented as rapidly as possible , in addition to the fact that those limitations themselves reveal how crucial it is to ensure these countries special and differentiated treatment , which guarantees levels of protection able to ensure their development .
the Auto / Oil Programme is based on directive 94 / 12 / EEC , one of the first directives concerned with the procedure for joint decision-making between Parliament and the Council .
by the same token , ladies and gentlemen , the European Union has a duty to take targeted measures against those who threaten peace , security and stability in Somalia .
 
equally , we need to choose the top leaders as soon as possible , and not to waste time .
you will therefore have to turn around to check the exact time .
unfortunately , we have to acknowledge that Mrs Kolarska-Bobińska &apos;s report , which is an excellent piece of work , is being debated and voted on a little too late .
the EU must continue to support human rights and the development of a pluralistic society , to oppose trafficking in , and violence against , women and to further civil , democratic society .
if something is lost from Finland &apos; s heritage , then it is also lost to Greece , and if something is lost in Greece , then it is also lost to Denmark .
the point of reference for the work undertaken by the Belgian Presidency was Europe , in the full meaning of the term .
if you would like to invite me to address your committees on the subject , I shall have the greatest pleasure in accepting .
the fact that only an intergovernmental approach is being adopted on such an important subject is worrying .
thank you , Commissioner .
I regret to say that this report has a certain ideological slant .
how wide should this framework be ?
I am thinking here , for example , of in vitro fertilization , which places an enormous physical and psychological strain on women .
in this regard , once the Treaty has entered into force , I consider it of utmost importance that Parliament be fully informed in advance of important decisions to be adopted by the Energy Community .
report ( A5-0041 / 2000 ) by Mr Katiforis , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the Commission document on the EU economy : 1999 review ( C5-0081 / 2000 - 2000 / 2046 ( COS ) )
today we adopted our proposal for a citizens &apos; agenda ; the communication proposes 11 initiatives relating primarily to the internal market .
if we are to do that , then we must regulate just one thing : how much must there be in a product for that product to be capable of designation as such .
there is no simple solution .
it is doubtful whether the military action has thus far had any positive outcome , and it is therefore imperative that a political solution to the problem should be found as quickly as possible .
today &apos;s resolution is typical of the texts submitted to us on this subject .
it drew up an ambitious timetable according to which the sphere of action should be defined by the year 2000 .
in the final analysis , the OSCE did very good work there for a brief time , but as we can see , it was of course not in a position to build up the institutions in Albania again .
I want to say two things .
I would like to hear your opinion on this subject , Mrs Vassiliou , as well as your response to Parliament &apos;s request in its resolution of 27 April 2006 , seeking the creation of a European observatory on natural disasters to ensure a more effective European response when these unfortunate events occur .
this money comes from allocated funds for Liberia that were never used : because of the situation we could not work there normally .
the number of crimes of domestic violence recorded by the Portuguese Association for Victim Support ( APAV ) has increased by 9 % on the same period in 2008 .
may I just say that Sweden has been free of military alliances and has remained neutral for 200 years !
to close , I should like to stress that I shall take account of Parliament &apos;s opinion and I shall evaluate the positions formulated both in Parliament and in the Council .
young people should be educated , not killed .
what a disgrace it is that there are so many apologists for Saddam Hussein in this Chamber .
the two areas of &apos; aid for decentralised cooperation &apos; and &apos; aid for civil society &apos; go hand in hand .
one reason is its Europhile fanaticism , and I can assure him that in 2009 UK Independence Party MEPs will return here in even greater numbers .
President of the Commission . - Of course , human rights are part of the European Union but we have a system based on the rule of law and we assume that all Member States , including your country , are countries governed by the rule of law .
nor is this a decision that can be made on religious grounds : referring to the comments made by certain honourable Members , I would say that it is my conviction that our Union , our Community , is based on law and on human rights ; it can never be a Union based on any form of religious bias .
I would like to emphasise the need to support research and development in new cleaner energy technologies that can meet our needs and to support what that requires in terms of investment in R + D.
Commissioner , in answering Question 27 , you told us that only 1 % of EU land was in biofuel production .
other amendments are not acceptable , because they are incompatible with existing Community procedures or important legal aspects , or because they are covered by other legal provisions either in this text or in other Community texts .
therefore , we can support the Parliament &apos;s proposal as regards article 6 .
I hope we can continue to work in this spirit in the area of internet governance .
Mr President , it is a tragedy , in the Europe of the 21st century , that there are so many serious problems with violations of human rights , as we have heard in Mr Cornillet &apos; s excellent report .
that is a very pressing necessity and the European Union can and must take this problem on board .
while these matters remain primarily for Member States there is a European responsibility in regard to each of them and suggested amendments , if incorporated in the new Treaty , will help us carry that Treaty with our electorates .
in short , we support the complementary proposals , Professor Cabrol &apos;s amendment and the general proposal from the Commission .
in that case , green trade policy is not directed against developing countries but against the richer countries , which can , in fact , result in help for developing countries .
because as we all know , there is not a great deal of point in winning court cases after years of discussions , if the damage to the environment has already been done .
motion for a resolution ( B5-0620 / 2002 ) tabled by Diana Wallis and Astrid Thors on behalf of the ELDR Group , on the Statute for Members
the report on inserting a new Rule 79a , presented by the chairman of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure , the Verification of Credentials and Immunities , Mr Fayot , has been the object of prolonged and deep discussion within the committee .
the federalist ideologies have made Europe forget this elementary lesson , and we are going to have to pay very dearly for that one day .
the debate is closed .
in all instances where we already have sensible coordination of our economic policies in the European Union , we have chalked up enormous successes .
there is a need for a new peace conference , but there is also a need for new people to take part in this .
the Commission blocked 100 budget lines , in the region of 920 million euros , in order to examine their legal bases .
it goes without saying that I am also in favour of reducing the cost of labour , but we shall then have to see how these costs are replaced by other measures , other means .
the Constitution is a means to that end .
today , we do not focus sufficiently on matching research to business developments , by building pilot and demonstration plants to get up to full commercial scale .
my last point is that 1997 is the Year against Racism .
we could then be sure that sharp growth and improved quality of life really will occur in cities .
the Commission is now included in the planning of these missions from the beginning as a matter of course .
I assume that everybody will agree with this .
but we always blame the Member States for this and say that they commit more than they are then able to spend .
we insistently and constantly call for the self-evident : for human rights and fundamental freedoms to apply equally to men and women , with no discrimination whatsoever .
we have received agreement from fifteen Member States and fifteen postal services .
of course , I know it was a rhetorical question , because he is very committed to a solution , but it is a fact that the European Union has a direct interest in the outcome of the Middle East peace process .
like the Commission , the rapporteur believes this procedure should be refocused towards giving greater right of asylum to applicants who want &apos; to find safety &apos; .
the feeling is that pay flexibility might help in some way .
it is certainly not the intention of the Commission or Commissioner Verheugen to interfere in this matter .
that is all that we can say at present .
let them convince us , not least the Council , that they have some principles and they are not always guided by expediency .
the successful implementation of this directive is a fundamental precondition for creating a unified internal market .
in spite of that , Europe remains divided .
you must understand that I would first of all like to be fully aware of the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affair &apos;s comments before being able to comment on them myself .
I believe that the accession of Romania and Bulgaria on 1 January 2007 will also prove to be a great success .
we therefore take the view that a review should only be started if there is clear proof of the need to amend the directive .
the journalist Natalia Estemirova , who was well known to everyone in our group , was murdered there .
Member of the Commission . - ( NL ) The answer to the first part of the question is a resounding &apos; yes &apos; : it returns to the Member States .
the next item is the Statement by the Commission on the follow-up to the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts which has been issued to you , as you wished , as speedily as possible .
my answer is an unqualified yes .
teachers and all those involved in these activities say ‘ do we really have to reinvent the wheel ?
is it not , perhaps , that they are thereby enabled to make money from cheap seasonal labour , from the putative self-employed , and from those working in the black market ?
with its do-gooder amendments , the left is setting out a non-policy for the return of illegal immigrants .
I am convinced that with the support of the House and acting also on its behalf , the Commission will be able to ensure that all the problems previous speakers rightly pointed out are resolved .
Commissioner , I should just like to ask you if the same phenomenon applies to other products , i.e. if there are coding systems for other products , because the culture industry is extremely sensitive , there is huge competition from America , which we are unable to withstand , as we know all too well .
clearly though , it must be monitored , a task which falls to the European Commission .
the complementary question which I would like to ask concerns the situation of private postal companies in connection with forthcoming European legislation , something which I think we have debated far too little in the European Parliament .
Mr President , in keeping with a long tradition of statements that both appease and stir up the masses , the conclusions of the latest Brussels Summit state that the enlarged Union seeks - and I quote - &apos; to ensure the orderly development of its policies for the benefit of all its citizens &apos; .
lastly , I would point out that one can never invest too much in airport and passenger security , as was clearly shown by the latest attempted terrorist attacks against civil aviation , which were luckily foiled .
however , a secondary aspect is that it also contributes significantly to simplifying the law .
the latter would have led to the circumvention of employee participation .
therefore , Mr Barroso , I recommend that you work harder , as you have said , on this declaration next year .
this shows that much remains to be done in spite of our success .
the debate is closed .
unfortunately , in the European Union , we do not have a competitive single natural gas market yet and some Member States are very reluctant to separate the production activity from the distribution activity .
the Balkans : a failure of the European Union . The Mediterranean and the Middle East : a second failure .
Europe needs to continue facilitating the participation of both men and women in the economy , as well as helping combine family and professional life .
could the Commission also comment in this regard on the lack of a political commitment to come out of the Stockholm Summit ?
I would also like to say in this regard that we obviously very much want to be in a position to encourage the implementation of the European Rail Traffic Management System , the ERTMS , since it is by means of this system that we shall guarantee interoperability for the whole of the European rail system .
also important is the choice of transparency and publicity laid down in Articles 21 , 22 , 23 and 24 of the Code itself , and especially Article 25 , which states that an offer made over the Internet should be made in accordance with the European scheme and in compliance with all the provisions and indications that are laid down .
it is in this spirit that the President of the French Republic was anxious to provide the necessary explanations regarding the ambitious structural reform programme that he is going to implement .
these discussions show that the subject of global warming and the Kyoto Protocol , and particularly what will follow the Kyoto Protocol , is vitally important and we must therefore pursue this line of dialogue with the Russians .
press reports have recently stated that Member States have been faced with importers ’ court actions challenging Member State moves to recover duty on suspected settlement imports which Israel ’ s customs authorities have maintained are eligible for preferential treatment .
that , Commissioner , is why there is a need - I would say an imperative - for a Commission communication in this regard , to instigate action in the field of development aid from the European Union and its Member States and also the various formulas contained in the motion for a resolution on which we are to vote .
it will be even more difficult to agree on how to define the concept of &quot; damaging &apos; .
it is worrying that a considerable haul of weapons has been stolen by criminal gangs , with all the risks of increased lawlessness , armed conflicts and terrorism in the area that this entails .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , the European Commission , as a matter of priority , is following the situation in Myanmar and Thailand , including the recent incidents where refugees from Bangladesh and Myanmar were stranded in Thailand .
in some cases corrective action has been slow , in others , staff and financial resources allocated have been insufficient to achieve the desired level of improvement .
at the next part-session , will we be condemning an attack made on her ?
it is not national finances , including co-funding , which could put in danger the fulfilment of convergence criteria , because we are talking about thousandths of points of GDP .
the need for Europe &apos;s peoples to decide their own future . For a Europe of peace , friendship and equality between its peoples , democracy , improved standard of living for its citizens , a Europe focused on human beings and not on profits .
.
the aim of the Commission &apos;s proposal is to reduce ship emissions of sulphur dioxide and particulate matter .
with regard to the hours of night work , guarantees are provided for the competitiveness of the outermost countries , whose drivers have to travel long distances in order to reach the main centres of production and distribution , travelling at night when traffic is less heavy .
Members of this committee are designated by Member States , and the Commission chairs the meetings .
we share our rapporteur ’ s concerns .
this is unfortunate , because what is it that makes it unnecessary to monitor agriculture , especially when one considers that more than 40 % of the budget is spent on it ?
however , I believe that the problem and the key to your question is that Article 165 does not give the Council the right to act .
it is also important that European Union representations around the world are not duplicated or triplicated .
that might be at the root of the kind of perception they have .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as an Austrian who comes from a country with many border regions , a significant rural sector and mountainous areas , I welcome the reports that have been tabled .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , the Special European Council in Lisbon on employment , economic reform and social cohesion is to pursue , as you have told us , an objective which is ambitious , very ambitious , at the risk of disappointing our fellow citizens , conscious as they are that decreeing full employment and the eradication of poverty in Europe cannot , in itself , ensure that this objective is attained .
we should like to see a clearer general recommendation concerning the abolition of the death penalty .
I am aware of your efforts ; you are putting a lot into this issue .
this needs to be changed .
I live just on the other side , downstream on the Rhine and Meuse rivers , and my brother has a dairy farm in an area designated a flood retention basin when there is too much water .
the next item is the debate on the following oral questions
the European Commission has provided the necessary emergency help via its humanitarian organization , ECHO . It recently made ECU 1.5 million available , and is naturally prepared to allocate more where necessary .
decisions concerning certain documents : see Minutes
here I hope for the active support of the European Parliament and ask you to focus all your efforts on this and not on an interim regulation .
in terms of keeping the general public informed , this should not be a problem in this day and age with e-mail .
what we need to do is to continue with the effort of focusing on the main corridors , including the sea corridors , and to integrate the priority projects of the future new Member States of the Union .
one thing is certain , if there is military intervention in Iraq , the Iraqi people , who have already suffered so much , will defend themselves to the last and we will not enter Baghdad as liberators .
by accepting this , the House understands that the Commission has committed itself to immediately initiating the necessary proceedings to ensure that those other services that are rendered without payment are also protected by European legislation as soon as possible . As far as these services are concerned , there is no doubt that criminal activities also damage an interest that can be legally protected , and this , in the last analysis , affects them economically .
Mr President , on a point of order , or a point of concern almost , a number of Members on this side of the House have noticed that you may have lost your jacket and on a snowy day can we offer you one of ours just in case you get cold .
I think that we now all have a political responsibility to achieve this both for political reasons and because we need distinct employment policies in the European Union as a whole .
 
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( NL ) Mr President , Mr Cornillet has written an excellent summary of the activities of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly ( JPA ) in 2006 , a JPA that is growing in credibility and power , which no longer avoids difficult debates , including migration , and which also dares make choices , even though the ambition remains to reach consensus as a rule .
Mr Marinos , if the President-in-Office of the Council wishes to reply to you in some way , I have no objection . Naturally she shall have the floor .
I would like to come back to what Mr Šefčovič had to say , particularly in relation to the EU pilot project , which has been criticised sharply by a number of Members of Parliament because , as you stated clearly yourself , it offers &apos; more possibilities for Member States &apos; but not for citizens .
the essential points I wish to bring out are these : it should be customary for Commission and Parliament to cooperate together , and for both of them to cooperate with the other institutions ; Parliament should have more control over the definition and implementation of policies ; there should be more openness from the ordinary citizen &apos;s point of view ; and , finally , information policy and the profit / cost ratio should be more efficient .
at all events , my country , which already has many towns in the hands of racists and xenophobes , would be in a particularly bad position for doing so .
so leave that one aside .
let me also explain that the Lisbon Treaty will strengthen the roles of the national parliaments , involving them more directly in the mechanisms of the European Union .
in fact the Treaty of Lisbon , as I read it , is very strong on the social dimension and has no desire to mistreat or abuse workers throughout the European Union or elsewhere .
this is what I propose : a mandate to allow me to cut EUR 580 000 from one of the lines on which we have voted for amendments .
the EU has always stood in defence of democracy , freedom of speech and freedom of conscience , and those values were , for decades , violated by the socialist regime , not only in Hungary , but also in the many other countries of what was known as the Eastern bloc .
all the issues we deal with in the area of justice and home affairs affect European citizens in their daily lives .
on the other hand , including milk and milk derivatives in Article 186 grants certain powers to the Committee set up by the European Parliament and to the Council , although no specific indication has been given of what practical action is to be taken .
it is these differences between North and South , East and West which , on the whole , make a joint forestry policy inappropriate . Such a policy should not be introduced within the European Union .
as to the proposals contained in my report , which were adopted unanimously by the Committee on Petitions , I should like to start by commenting on one which I consider is of both practical and symbolic value .
a fundamental role was allocated to the External Border Practitioners Common Unit , which coordinated the implementation of the operations provided for in the plans .
the wording , work of equal value is not enough , for there is then a risk of employers less conscious of their responsibilities exploiting this opportunity to create worse conditions for parental leave .
perhaps we shall get round to expressing surprise or even dismay about that state of affairs when the intimidation and repression of foreign journalists - which has already begun - becomes even more drastic , for they are already being prevented from working .
which measures will you be taking to encourage the wealthy countries to contribute to the costs of this crisis ?
the background to my question is that inspections of meat imported into Sweden have revealed far too many cases of salmonella , despite all the certification from the country of shipment being present and correct .
the Commission can accept all the amendments .
bearing that situation in mind , when it comes to the IGC , the Council and Member States will appreciate the good sense of what is being proposed here .
among the many measures which must be implemented , this evening I shall mention , in particular , the training and the mobility of researchers , to go back to a previous debate which involved the Commissioner and researchers from my own region .
first of all , foreign policy .
subject : Legal rights of asylum-seekers
thirdly , we failed to establish liability for the nuclear industry in the event of accidents .
my second point has to do with discrimination .
this is how I see the action plan ; this is how I see our joint action .
I would agree with the Commission ’ s assessment that Romania should be in a position to comply with economic criteria by accession , provided it continues and intensifies its efforts , in particular by paying attention to its external balance , public sector wage policy and the government ’ s revenue base .
it has to be said that we are entitled to discuss this matter because Hungary is part of the European Union .
the work done on security means that the problem persists in just 14 places .
I will explain why when I have finished what I have to say .
we cannot let this develop into an endless process .
for these measures must be coordinated , because they would then be significantly more effective .
like other documents , both the resolution and the report on establishing a Community civil protection mechanism of 18 September 2006 ) recognise the importance of the Community civil protection mechanism and call for the creation of a European civil defence force that could react immediately in emergencies , as also proposed in the report by former Commissioner Barnier .
but please , let us respect all the stages and work through them one by one .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , our trans-European routes , our roads and motorways , are being clogged up daily by millions of lorries , buses and cars , which leads to wasted time , wasteful energy consumption and significant environmental damage , amongst other things .
we will not give mixed signals , but rather a clear guide for achieving our dream of seeing a democratic Cuba .
though the European Year of Tourism is at the heart of the report , Mr De Luca refers in particular to further serious abuses at Directorate-General level , but goes on to mention a number of improvements which the Commission has sought to introduce .
we must act to tackle the risk that many young people will finish their education and slide straight into unemployment .
.
the peace process in Ireland has benefited hugely from the EU budget .
the fact is that the need to keep the Cohesion Fund is even further justified with the coming of the euro .
the debate is closed .
in order to be able to manage legal economic migration , however , we must first deal with harnessing the potential and mobility of the workforce within the Union .
people keep saying that what Israel does is of no account , but I fail to see a Palestinian gesture to enable talks .
the boom of the Internet was made possible by the State &apos;s inability to curb it with a mass of bans and regulations .
the Commission &apos;s report on the Single Market Act follows on from Mr Monti &apos;s report on &apos; A new strategy for the Single Market &apos; .
that is why I very much welcome the fact that we have here a specific programme that supports the mobility of researchers and focuses on socio-economic research , particularly with regard to the innermost part of our society .
we nonetheless support the general improvements proposed by the report , including more precise definitions of concepts , for the wordings of quite a few definitions have led to misinterpretations during the implementation of the directive .
Mr President , Mr Prodi , ladies and gentlemen , May 1999 will go down in history as one of Europe &apos;s best and worst months politically speaking .
however , even before Mr Bigliardo spoke , I wanted to ask that , in tomorrow &apos;s debate on the events in Israel and Palestine , the Commission call upon all the European citizens who are not officials of the United Nations , NATO or the European Union to refrain from indulging in macabre tourism out of curiosity and false solidarity .
I would like the Commission to keep us informed with regard to the initiatives it is taking both to help the United Nations intervene rapidly on behalf of the civil population affected and to break with this logic of collective suicide to which the sinister North Korean regime has committed its people .
what does the Commission say to providing a briefing every quarter or every six months ?
I follow Mr Cornelissen &apos;s report on this point .
Mr President , the contribution made by the European Union through the San José dialogue to ending the horrific civil wars in Nicaragua , El Salvador and , more recently , Guatemala is very considerable and demonstrates quite clearly the positive role that the European Union can play on the world scene .
– The debate is closed .
we still cannot overlook the influence on competitiveness and unemployment in the Union for which politicians such as ourselves - and not doctors or industry - are responsible .
firstly , economic growth is much stronger now than we thought it was a few weeks or months ago .
that the budget we are presenting today is clearly a responsible one is shown , however , by the fact that Parliament has not tried to challenge the interinstitutional agreement .
I can assure him that , in close coordination with the national administrations and representative organizations , the Commission will endeavour to facilitate the adaptation of the public and private sectors in each Member State .
I am thinking particularly of the matter of adopting the euro .
then there is the amendment of Annex 6 , common principles .
after all , democracy is more than just democratic institutions , although that is part of it .
but , on the other hand , there is a lack of realism : in an earlier reference in paragraph 5 ( ix ) we have the usual rehearsal of left-wing objections to the activities of speculators .
I must stress that the explosion in worldwide requirements in the civil aerospace sector poses challenges of a new magnitude in terms of reducing environmental pollution and in terms of financing costs and democracy .
for example , one of the objectively important and delicate questions concerning the way the Council works is the question of the rotation of the presidency , a question which Javier Solana spoke about just now .
I believe that these major export subsidies are basically divisive and destroy the agricultural market in large parts of the Third World .
the Russian Foreign Minister has linked the EU mission to Kosovo with a new UN Security Council resolution on the presence of the international community in Kosovo .
arrears for those countries which were at $ 1.2 billion in 1980 have now increased to $ 43 billion .
the three initiatives announced by the Commission will certainly have a place in those .
certainly we should try to make as many as possible of our foreign interlocutors into our friends , but before doing that and while doing that I believe we have to learn to operate with those who are not like us .
this report demands a more active approach on the part of the Member States in the field of visual education , particularly of professional training and media literacy .
in the budget we oppose the reduction in payment appropriations which the Council has made in relation to the Commission &apos;s proposal on FEDER programmes and various Community initiatives .
it has increased our ability to access knowledge , aided our understanding of the world around us and reinforced our social connections to other people .
that involvement is the prerequisite for our cooperation in specific areas .
the test , I would remind you , is not that the measures should be useful or even that they should be important .
this security requires a diversification of energy sources and will involve major long term , not to say extremely long-term investment .
forests and ore , which constitute the backbone of Swedish industry , must not be affected by the proposed legislation .
it can occur naturally to such an extent that you are recommended not to use it for your children because it could affect their teeth .
it seems to me that there are a number of misapprehensions around on this issue and when the Commissioner replies I hope he will bring a breath of fresh air into all this .
I should also like to take advantage of this opportunity to underline the importance of introducing methods for the exchange of good practice concerning implementation of the notion of corporate social responsibility .
&apos; don &apos;t forget us &apos; is what your brave countrymen said .
I hope that we can approve the text without any of the amendments presented .
I will not go into who was right or wrong or who had greater national interests to defend , but I have to say that foreign policy is not just a matter of who is right and who is wrong . Foreign policy is about getting solutions which best serve peace and security in one &apos;s own country or region and , in our case , Europe .
they also have a right to expect Members of Parliament to exercise their control functions without resorting to party-political tactics .
this question is supplementary to the reports by Mr Gaubert and Mr Lambrinidis on immigration issues .
to close ...
certainly not the social movements and unions , who have been manipulated from the outset by the Eurocrats for ultimately failing to take account of their additions on social and democratic rights .
my only regret is that the controls and limitations on the resources available to the Community will mean that that support is not as substantial ultimately as we would like it to be , especially given the urgency and priority which the whole European Union should attach to the successful completion of this project .
I wish to thank Mrs Berger for a very comprehensive and thorough piece of work and for being very persistent in presenting her arguments to us .
let me say that I recognise the good intention of the Commission in offering to brief my committee about the work undertaken in the preparation and negotiation of this Treaty , although our reaction might have been more welcoming and less suspicious of what was being proposed had it not come out of the blue without any prior knowledge on our part .
I will be brief because I know there are some time constraints , but one could , of course , speak at length about security and defence cooperation as an important element of our partnership .
now I buy a new microwave every year - the cheapest I can find - and it is then thrown away .
I am in favour of giving priority to creating and boosting employment at this time of crisis and also of pressing ahead with the realisation of the flexicurity principle .
today , it is probably the only public service in many remote areas and people are concerned that European legislation will eventually make it difficult to maintain it .
it is with regard to this area that I have serious doubts as to whether the programme as it stands will prove useful .
Tenzin Delek Rinpoche is an emblem : he is an important lama of Lithang county in Kardze , arrested in 2002 just after an attack in Chengdu .
I received an invitation to sample foie gras .
citizenship must be defined by certain civic behaviour as much as by active and daily participation in society .
there is an urgent need to find effective solutions for this key sector of French and European agriculture , and to make a radical policy change , since - let us not beat around the bush - it is the European Commission , the Council , the European Parliament and their ultra-liberalism that hold sole responsibility for this tragedy .
we should be targeting our support specifically to those who are genuinely improving their standards and are complying with the mechanism in practice .
I might mention that this is also an ambitious goal in view of the continuing need for a great deal of harmonisation within the EU , whether in the fiscal , administrative or legal spheres .
under the Regions for Economic Change initiative the Commission supports an exchange of best practice through the regional network &apos; Integrating marginalised youth &apos; .
by the way , I can only speak for myself , but I am no bureaucrat - I am a directly elected member of this House .
and this is at the cost of sacrifices that are sometimes difficult for populations to bear .
if we want healthy consumers , we need to provide them with European foods .
secondly , taxes reflect the democratic choice of the citizens of the various countries .
here we are talking about abortion , which is accepted throughout most Member States of the European Union and has been accepted by this House .
that amount contrasts , of course , with the US $ 7 bn which the IFOR operation is costing .
so we will make sure that the points made by each speaker have been correctly set down .
the Financial Services Action Plan is now more or less complete , so the focus is now on implementation and supervisory convergence .
ladies and gentlemen in Europe , do not waver around the next war in this way .
otherwise people will become tools of the market rather than the market becoming a tool of the people .
the purpose of the mission is to guarantee the security of the civilian population , but unfortunately there is evidence that the force is being used as a pawn in the internal game in Chad .
finally , it should be highlighted that the Commission has contributed to work by the Development Assistance Committee , the DAC of the OECD , to develop policy guidelines for Member countries .
we have this agreement , this memorandum , and we must stick to it .
the Commission will also be adopting the follow-up report on its Green Paper next week or by the latest the following week .
the European Police College has noble objectives : to promote common European policing standards , cross-border cooperation in the fight against crime and uphold the rule of law and legislation .
this is entirely in line with President Putin &apos;s economic concept of &apos; modernisation through Europeanisation &apos; .
there are on the one hand programmes that are run through the World Bank and UN funds and are aimed at meeting the population ’ s basic needs for such things as , for example , education , health care and water .
I repeat : lost , since even today we in Europe still do not have efficient structures for the prosecution of EU financial crime .
alcohol producers thus naturally want to increase their markets in countries where consumption remains low .
Mr Harbour has reminded me of our confrontation but I can assure him that our confrontations are always exciting .
I am delighted that there is such a broad consensus on these issues .
it was not easy to find the right approach , as Europe itself does not have the competence to ban this hunting .
it must not tremble at every frown from his lordship in the Kremlin .
still , however , it is in this document , stating that maybe these kinds of incomes can be used .
I can guarantee that all seven parliamentary parties in Sweden , especially my own Christian Democratic Party , are concerned about the matter .
the Commission has thus put an end to this illegal situation , and I thank them for it .
however , I should nevertheless like to draw your devoted and kind attention to these two important amendments and maybe , upon completion of this 2002 budgetary procedure , we could visit Semipalatinsk together to witness the disastrous effects of the nuclear insanity and to see how European money could be spent in a effective and useful manner .
why is this the case ?
therefore , because this amendment duplicates existing requirements and because the deadline is not realistic , the Commission cannot accept Amendment 5 .
there was also disquiet in Hungary about the critical judgment passed on the &apos; status law &apos; on Hungarians in other countries .
the Regulation came into force on 5 May 2001 .
however , this is tempered by the knowledge that cases remain where the ICTY has been unable to access certain documents relating to alleged war crimes , and further attention must be given to minority rights such as the status of the Krajina Serbs and refugee return .
nonetheless , I believe that this project requires three things : Firstly , a political stamp will give it importance and meaning for our citizens .
given the sector &apos;s current needs and ecosystem concerns , the European Commission has proposed that Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1543 / 2000 be amended while the European Parliament assesses a proposal for a Council regulation on a new Community framework for the collection , management and use of data in the fisheries sector .
such an improvement would serve to reassure public opinion about the quality of our accession process and about the pace of expansion of Europe &apos;s post-national society .
secondly , we should learn lessons for the management of future pandemics , which could be more aggressive , and understand how and when to act and what measures to take .
I am still looking for a Roma in Italy - and please someone tell me if they know of one - who is legally employed and who pays taxes .
we all wish to see stricter standards applied in this sector , along with a series of coherent criteria , to ensure that only reputable transport operators remain in the market , providing a high quality service in the interests of their clients and of society as a whole .
we Cypriots are not against the Europeanisation of Turkey .
we are at the threshold of creating a wider , stronger Europe ; a Europe which stretches from Warsaw to Edinburgh ; a peaceful , prosperous and confident Europe ; a Europe which can speak with one voice in the world but which respects and encourages different national cultures to flourish within the Union .
it tends towards the superficial and hardly looks like an integrated tool for analysing the current situation , allowing a proper appraisal of progress , programming future action in areas broached by the European Commission , such as integration of the disabled , involvement of the elderly , worker mobility and outstanding legislative proposals , or suggesting new topics .
in any case , monitoring certainly has been .
in the first instance , much of this has to do with the fact that no one has any sense of belonging to the EU , and that most only see the EU and its budget as a source of grants and subsidies .
we therefore give our entire support to the Council of Europe in its investigations , and I would also ask the Member States to conduct their own where necessary .
the European Union is very good at spending money - at spending other people &apos;s money .
Mr President , my congratulations to Mrs Figueiredo and to the Committees on Culture and Women &apos;s Rights for their contributions to the final text of the report .
question No 11 by Jens-Peter Bonde ( H-0751 / 98 )
we ask the Ukrainian authorities to make a formal commitment to hold October &apos;s forthcoming presidential elections in conditions of the greatest possible transparency , and hope that the European Commission will consider , along with Parliament and other bodies , whether we should send an election observation mission .
on the other hand it is also a non-formal education or learning process .
and secondly , the Commission is on the right road and we urge the Commission to evaluate the results automatically a year after this directive comes into force , and to set the second level of objectives as a function of that .
reference has been made to some studies that go in the other direction , but my advice is that those studies are old studies and the more modern view is in accordance with the view that I have just expressed .
you and your colleagues have been wrong several times , and although you listened to the request for a check , you did not in the case of my report , and I asked for twice .
it has funds , EUR 70 million to be precise , and well-designed capacities for coordination , but we need the unambiguous assistance of the Council , for example , to make the CRATE database more than a catalogue of means or a declaration of offers .
the development of a specific infrastructure in less developed countries could certainly combat the irresponsible use of chemicals which would otherwise damage the ecology , economy and working conditions .
this still remains the basic measure that could increase demand and thereby ensure that the car industry and its suppliers continue to have a secure market .
a number of you rightly and understandably mentioned the other important item that is on the agenda more with a view to decision making , in a sense , at the coming European Council : justice and home affairs .
the amount of euros we are talking about really covers that category .
the number of hours of training now to be prescribed - a minimum 210 hours and a maximum of 630 hours - is lower than is already required in some Member States .
. the EPLP is , in principle , in favour of a link between levels of taxation and our commitments to reducing environmental pollution .
but we do not yet have a European political union .
 
I do not need to explain to you that the issue of freedom of expression and freedom of the press is what is at stake for the Commission ; and that it would be ridiculous if we did not make that a top priority with regard to defending democracy .
oral questions and written declarations ( submission ) : see Minutes
it fulfils the fondest wish of the vast majority of European citizens , as it was , in the past , far from self-evident that this wish would be fulfilled .
unfortunately , there could be no question of the European Union singing from the same hymn sheet .
I agree . There are obstacles that we have to eliminate .
we have to break down the barriers and to do that we have to rewrite Declaration 30 differently . In this way , if , when the time comes , for example , 22 out of 27 countries say ‘ yes ’ and 5 say ‘ no ’ , the 5 who say ‘ no ’ either accept the majority rule or they stand down .
I would like to thank my group , which is allowing me to speak despite knowing that I do not agree with their position .
if the Iraqi regime has nothing to hide , why do they bar access to the UN-mandated inspectors ?
for these reasons , it is vital that there should be swift implementation of this Framework Agreement , and it is important to recognise the need for constant evaluation in order to improve the efficiency and efficacy of this institutional relationship .
it is clear that the overarching aim of our actions is first and foremost the fight against poverty in the context of the Millennium Development Goals .
we all know that a touch can be either a gentle caress or the hug of a bear .
trafficking in human beings is an abomination that the European Union unfortunately cannot ignore .
so far as the accounts are concerned , the Court of Auditors has found that the 2001 revenue and expenditure account gives a true and fair view of the income and expenditure , and this is confirmed in Mr Casaca &apos;s report .
however , I should also like to say this : we have always been successful when we have put the community of Europe at the heart of our work and have not reduced the European Union to the work of government .
water production must therefore stay in government hands , but for many developing countries private capital is needed for water distribution .
bizarrely enough , the European leader of the tax dumping pack – particularly where company taxes are concerned – is neither an Eastern European state nor Ireland , but the Federal Republic of Germany , supposedly a high-tax country , where a tax reform forced through by the former Schröder Government – which justified its action by reference to fiscal competition across Europe – brought corporation tax yield to an utter standstill .
it is by redefining the WTO in rules of this type that we are engaging not only in fair trade but also in democracy .
this certainly holds true for globalisation , which permits greater growth in wealth , international trade and productivity .
an action plan , well , the colleague is not there any more , but an action plan for combating the violence against women .
what this means is that we have an tremendous problem with the Structural Funds , but the solution does not lie in including unnecessary funding under bogus headings in the budget .
I would like to pick up on what Mr Walter said in his intervention with reference to the adjustment of the Financial Perspective in the course of enlargement .
the excellent report by Konrad Schwaiger , which deserves consensus and a majority , makes clear that this is about more than just trade policy ; it is about the participation of all countries on the basis of equal rights , social progress and the enforcement of human rights .
in the EU , not even two thirds of those who are capable of work are in work .
this discrimination goes against the basis of the European Union and the foundations on which the EU is supposed to be built .
this mainly concerns just three countries , namely France , Germany and Portugal . We should remember that , when considering the budget or any other subject , we must not fail to see the wood for the trees .
we all fully agree that a commercial outlet , if it sells an electrical appliance or an item of electronic hardware , must take it back .
we have not discussed any of that , unfortunately .
why is this the case ?
yes , we should use and promote sustainable energy sources , but pursuit of what for most has become a dogma with no regard to cost or viability needs to be tempered by reality , including the reality that climate change is not new , but cyclical , as well as the reality that while we inflict these targets on ourselves , manufacturing increasingly switches to where no such restraints inhibit them .
this means that they have to stick rigidly to their treatment regime and that distribution channels are therefore needed to ensure that the patients concerned can always obtain their medicines .
these are articles which , together with the other amendments , have the merit of removing uncertainties and simplifying interpretation .
this situation is very worrying from the point of view of the digital divide , which the Union is endeavouring to combat , at any rate in its documents .
Mr President , I totally agree with your decision .
a good thing , I find it a very good thing , is that the Council resolution takes account of the specific position of female asylum-seekers .
in addition , it exceeded its terms of reference , insofar as it was never asked to draw up a draft Constitution .
even if these companies account for only a small part of total production , the products are often used in small specialised areas .
the European Court of Justice has ruled in favour .
everybody agrees that developments in justice and home affairs matter and that they will play a crucial role in the success of the enlargement process as a whole .
to conclude , it is essential that the Council adopts an integrated approach towards the legal tools to be established in order to apply Article 13 in our daily life .
the vote will take place on Wednesday , 10 February 2010 .
it is no wonder that UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown is refusing to give the British people a referendum on the new reform treaty .
these ambitions should be adjusted to suit the current economic situation .
I dream of a world governed by international law , based on cooperation between all States , large and small .
her supporters know that by gathering together they are defying the ruling junta .
I cannot emphasise enough how pleased I am that there is now a fixed timetable for the accession procedure .
I support those in the Council and in the Commission who hold the view that a country like Indonesia which is not only refusing to implement the reforms agreed with the International Monetary Fund , but is actually choosing to reject them , should not be able to count on the support of the Asia-Europe partners and that , on the contrary , both the Community and the Asian countries should work towards changing the political and economic circumstances in this country .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the action plan on the single market presented by the Commission according to the very appropriate formulation of your rapporteur , Mr von Wogau , prepares for the move from the single market to the internal market .
I can say in advance that I agree with most of the amendments , with a few exceptions that I should like to mention quickly .
however , we have voted against paragraphs 2 and 6 , because they seem to us to be legally incorrect .
a series of informal thematic meetings on specific issues in these categories is anticipated this year and next year .
extra quotas for industry , while fostering its competitiveness , nonetheless make it difficult to obtain funding .
there are certainly good grounds for claiming that a new resolution would have been superfluous , since a basic resolution , which covered the sanctions too , had already been adopted .
I hope that the preparations get underway as soon as possible .
that is incorrect .
fortunately , parliament has corrected a proposal on protecting prominent people , and the Spanish Presidency , in its opposition to my report on the market for public transport , did not manage to find a majority to enforce large-scale privatisations .
for this reason , I fully support the proposal put forward by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy .
I should also like to thank the Commission for its valuable assistance and the Portuguese Council Presidency , which has made a vital contribution to this good result as an open and constructive negotiating partner .
Mr President , Commissioner , last week Cyprus was in the news in connection with the violence in Kosovo in a rather peculiar way .
we are trying to maintain existing staffing levels but I have to say that this is not easy .
we will not be able to achieve any more in the first reading than we could achieve in a later conciliation process after an unspecified period .
I am not going to talk about figures , but I want fundamental principles to be respected .
 
( DE ) Mr President , although the approach chosen in this piece of legislation for pursuing an emissions-based policy on air quality is the right one , I do believe a more ambitious line could have been taken as regards limit values on nitrogen oxides in particular , for these pollutants cause major problems , particularly in narrow mountain valleys .
we ask for simple human rights : the right to a fair trial , the right to freedom of thought , conscience and religion , the right to freedom from torture and cruel or inhuman treatment , the right to privacy , the right to equality before the law and we reaffirm also Article 14.7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which has been mentioned today .
the protection of juveniles is a priority for guaranteeing the conservation of fish stocks and their long-term sustainability .
if we can take stock of the situation here in this House 70 years later , then I would draw your attention to the fact that since direct elections were introduced three Presidents of the European Parliament have been Spaniards : one conservative Christian Democrat and two Social Democrats .
however , Denmark and the United Kingdom have negotiated an opt-out clause that allows them to remain outside the euro area .
the first point I would like to make - and this has been alluded to by my friend and colleague , Mr Cushnahan - is that Hong Kong cannot pass law under its constitution if it contravenes the international standards of human rights .
in my opinion , the European Parliament , as the only body directly elected by all Europeans , should have rather more power than is actually the case today .
we feel that the principle of equality between MEPs is a necessary element of justice and transparency for our citizens .
in 2007 and 2008 , Parliament was not represented at the annual meeting of the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation ( NAFO ) .
in any case , he was here for the commentary .
it was emphasised that account should be taken of each country &apos;s special political and economic circumstances and that the issue as a whole should be seen in the context of the current deepening of cooperation with Russia .
let me give you a few examples .
I trust that the principle adopted will involve controlled immigration , carefully selected , as in the United States .
we have a commitment from the main European companies in this sector .
they value solutions and results , and quite rightly so .
I will tell you now that , tomorrow , together with 55 Members of all the political groups , we are going to table a resolution calling , not least , upon the members of the European Convention to introduce a Treaty reform enshrining the right of access to all the public meetings of our institutions in the Treaties : the right of access , including access via the Internet , to all the meetings and democratic instruments of the European Union .
it will encourage abuse .
( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , many women in Europe and throughout the world fight each day to end violence against them , but they cannot and should not carry on this struggle alone , because these acts of violence against women , largely perpetrated by men , are also acts of violence against the whole of humanity .
it is therefore important , in any case , that , in the name of short-term budgetary orthodoxy and of a legal approach to budget regulation , the many Member States no longer be able to stop this entire recovery plan .
this makes it particularly important that we should take 1990 as a base year .
it was a splendid decision and means that many of my worst fears have fortunately not come true .
I also see no connection here with other past or future negotiations .
it is now for you to tell us , Commissioner , the Members of the European Parliament , whether or not such an agreement was concluded in 1995 and , if so , what was actually agreed .
I suggest it is a step too far and one that nation states should rightly resist .
Mr Haarder somewhat overestimates my ministerial capacities for tax recovery .
we have come to the end of our agenda , and I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned .
the problem to date has been , in my experience in Northern Ireland , that the consumer has borne the brunt of the cost of the extra traceability , and this has been substantial .
question No 18 by Niels Sindal ( H-0018 / 97 )
we wasted a great deal of time .
the June List has therefore voted against the reports .
in the opinion of the Commission , as well as of various experts of the automotive industry , the construction of completely built-up truck cabs corresponds to the manufacture of trucks .
who needs 10 or 20 days to say : we are on the side of those who are fighting for freedom in Burma , full stop !
the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance supported some 30 compromise amendments , but also tabled further-reaching amendments seeking to tighten up the text with regard to hazardous waste , the treatment of bio-waste , &apos; end-of-waste status &apos; and the concept of by-products and waste that has ceased to be waste .
I have already corrected you in the Bureau too , and I find it rather irritating that this mistake makes you pass me over at Question Time , despite my having corrected the error .
I do not intend to insult or offend anyone by saying this , Mr President .
together with AIDS , TB and malaria , these diseases kill 14 million people each year , mainly in poor countries .
the question that raises the greatest emotion is the transparency of air ticket prices .
the Fast Track Initiative is an initiative of Unesco , the World Bank and various donors , including the Commission .
we will have to roll up our sleeves , though , and I wonder why the Member States have so far failed to take any measures .
the next item is the report ( A5-0405 / 2001 ) by Mrs McKenna , on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries , on the role of flags of convenience in the fisheries sector &#91; 2000 / 2302 ( INI ) &#93; .
Denmark provides support for SMEs in the use of e-business on the basis of similar initiatives in Ireland , the Netherlands , Finland , Sweden and Norway .
therefore we must fight them all without fear or favour .
I know we have excellent universities .
I wish to do the same and highlight one small point , one that Mrs Buitenweg has already mentioned .
the situation in the company Qimonda , which has announced the closure of plants in Germany and Portugal , is , unfortunately , not unique .
the two common positions before the House obviously command widespread support , as evidenced by the debate this evening .
what does that mean ?
therefore we have put on blinkers .
meat production from the dairy sector is steadily declining .
my group welcomes the opening of negotiations between the European Union and Algeria with a view to an association agreement .
on the one hand there is the unresolved Middle East conflict and tension in the Western Sahara .
now comes the moment of truth .
you are daring to assert that competition provides considerable protection against the abuse of power .
that is one of the reasons for adopting a European approach .
I rather think that it is a little too far-reaching and perhaps not sufficiently structured .
2 . Pakistan ( vote )
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the reason we are able to conclude this procedure at first reading is that we have succeeded in bringing about excellent cooperation across the group divide and with the other institutions .
if I may , I should like to differ from the Commissioner in regard to the fact of it being impossible to fund pensions in the future .
questions relating to transportation and energy are also of decisive importance for the combating of climate change .
in addition , the change also approved here to increase the level of aid over the last three years by 20 % is important in my view , in part because this level has not yet stabilised following the Agenda 2000 reform , and it is also yet another incentive for small farmers to apply for aid .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , esteemed colleagues , ladies and gentlemen .
Romania and Bulgaria adopted the Schengen acquis when they joined the European Union in 2007 .
in the resolution it is drafting , the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport is calling for a clearer and greater role for the European Parliament .
I am convinced that these relations benefit greatly from the links between the European Parliament and the US Congress .
if agriculture policy changes , the funding of it naturally has to change as well .
I think it is essential for us to be very sympathetic to the calls that are being made in this respect .
hopefully , in November we will get something a lot more concrete .
nor should it be forgotten that in recent years Mexico has joined organizations such as the OECD or APEC .
they regard as normal all behaviours contrary to nature and to the traditional values of Christian Europe , as well as those condoning insults to the feelings of Catholics and members of other faiths .
on behalf of the S &amp; D Group . - Madam President , in organising farcical elections and refusing a national dialogue involving all political and ethnic groups , the Junta shows that the &apos; pragmatic &apos; engagement with it is not working at all .
recommendation for second reading in the form of a letter , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council regulation amending Council Regulation ( EEC ) No 95 / 93 of 18 January 1993 on common rules for the allocation of slots at Community airports ( 6661 / 1 / 2002 - C5-0149 / 2002 - 2002 / 0013 ( COD ) )
rapporteur . - Mr President , I should like to ask colleagues to accept the replacement of Amendment 21 with a clearer text as follows : &apos; The Commission should address the problem of child trafficking in the sports sector in the context of the Council Framework Decision on combating trafficking in human beings , with particular attention to cases where some clubs might consider giving contracts to very young children in order to circumvent the home-grown rule &apos; .
finally , I think that , as my fellow Member has said , the summit of Least Developed Countries is being held at this very moment with the European Parliament , including European leaders .
over the coming months , the coordinator of the project will be announced , and this will of course be done in collaboration with your House .
there is then a need to assert most clearly that the objective of the consultative assembly is to improve information , but not under any circumstances to replace the national parliaments in any way .
these nine countries include the most important in economic terms - MERCOSUR , Chile , etc .
secondly , retraining of personnel for the new jobs being provided by the new railway companies .
there are also recommendations for creating national schemes for providing psychological rehabilitation to both sex offenders and the victims of sexual abuse .
as the House will be aware , the situation has changed considerably since the murder of the then Prime Minister Mr Zoran Dzindzic in March of last year .
the aim of the Schmitt report is to extend this degrading and inhumane system to the entire European Union .
by the same token , aid per tree will require new control mechanisms for the avoidance of new forms of fraud .
in our own countries we have allowed crime to overwhelm us .
moreover , we would ask the Council to analyse the situation in the world and in every EU Member State in annual human rights reports , in the interest of Europe &apos;s trustworthiness not to use double standards in its internal or external policy .
we are helping the wrong people .
these days , we need to involve the citizens .
Parliament and the Commission had asked for the revision of the Treaty to include a non-discrimination clause , and the Irish Presidency , thankfully , included it in the Council draft .
.
therefore , all State Parties of the Rome Statute should join in such cooperation , because otherwise , that effectiveness will not be achieved .
we are now faced with the enormous destruction which we have caused , mostly with no serious military objective .
the approach was that opportunities for integrated urban or regional development also exist in cross-border areas .
this should aim to remove ambiguities in the business environment , clarify the applicable regulatory regime and seek to reduce administrative burdens .
we cannot let a partner country like Russia get away with systematically isolating an area like this where such brutal violations of human rights are taking place , with closing it to journalists , to observers and to humanitarian organisations .
signature of acts adopted under codecision : see Minutes
I call on you to work quickly to withdraw the occupying forces as soon as possible .
it is a subject of considerable importance for Europe ’ s space of legal competence and these latest observations on the relations between the European Court of Justice and the national courts also require careful consideration , which I will not fail to give them .
Turkey has had this prospect for decades .
there is no scenario that would enable international forces to be promptly withdrawn .
democracy is not &apos; winner takes all &apos; .
organizations representing the disabled called for a prohibition on discrimination ; consumers &apos; organizations wanted consumer affairs to be included in the agenda for the IGC .
this is why we have tabled fourteen amendments which , if included , would make the report considerably more acceptable to my group , I can assure you .
the Commission , however , is less than forthcoming on this score .
there are also possible macroeconomic risks that stem from protectionist measures and unilateral action .
at last the Commission is starting to pull its finger out and will soon be appointing someone .
that is why our negotiating objectives on non-agricultural market access , on industrial goods and services are so important .
I am therefore pleased at the strong political message that Parliament has sent in this , the International Year of Forests .
1 ) First of all , I believe that the EU must continue to encourage the development in Turkey of pro-European , modern , secular elites , as well as spread European values and good quality information about European integration .
Mr President , the World Water Forums represent a unique opportunity to bring together all those groups in the world that are involved with water , be they official agencies , development banks , states , professional organisations , NGOs or local authorities .
what is the duty of the European Union ?
it has been very effective in investigating money-laundering , the proceeds of drug trafficking and , indeed , criminal activity generally .
the Minutes of yesterday &apos;s sitting have been distributed .
one can see that not so long ago , you were a Member of this House and so you like this environment very much !
the only limit would be the eleven hours of rest daily or the twenty-four hours of rest weekly , but the directive would be losing its purpose and only regulating the maximum four-monthly , six-monthly or annual working time , depending on the particular case .
B5-0484 / 2001 by Mrs Frassoni and others , on behalf of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance ;
I have written to Mr Kallas asking for some correct answers , and Mr Borrell received a copy of that letter .
the Commission &apos;s draft framework directive and the other statutes belonging to this telecoms package follow the correct line and are very balanced , and I am highly satisfied with them .
this would involve ignoring the fact that ten Member States have already ratified it and that the no votes in two States , although they express a negative position with regard to the Constitution , nonetheless do not constitute support for an alternative project and also include some contradictions .
the rapporteur nonetheless - and I quote from his explanatory statement - comes to the conclusion that &apos; a number of fundamental points remain to be clarified or are the subject of contradictory testimony &apos; .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the agreement that has been reached is not the one that we would have hoped for , despite the fact that Parliament fought with dignity for a more satisfactory budget .
B5-0447 / 2000 by Rühle , Boumediène-Thiery and Cohn-Bendit , on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group ;
&apos; However , one good thing will have come out of this unfortunate incident : it has highlighted the importance we attach to decisive political action by the European Union in the fight against all forms of discrimination .
if that does not happen , the 10 % can easily be called into question .
the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization forecast world sugar consumption at 145 million tonnes for 2004 and 2005 , with production at 143 million tonnes .
they deserve to have their names mentioned , for the difficult work requiring a high level of expertise , patience , international experience and true sense of diplomacy , with which they managed to reach the compromise regarding the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective .
Mr President , I want to make it clear to the House that establishing the method for control and transparency is not a matter for the Conference of Presidents . We were invited to a meeting in Luxembourg so that we could give our opinion , but we did not stay in the room because we were invited to leave when Parliament &apos;s Bureau made the decision .
finally , we also need to resolve without delay the problem with the Chinese imposition of customs duties on motor vehicle components and replacement parts , or else the last car manufacturers will end up leaving Europe and heading for China .
these priorities should be taken into account by all Members of this House when making this important and responsible decision .
the Minutes of yesterday &apos;s sitting have been distributed .
such elections cannot produce a truly legitimate freely elected Parliament because of the way in which candidates are preselected .
fortunately , the Commission has shown initiative in this matter , however , and has focused attention on accelerating developments here .
this law needs to be revised .
irrespective of the fact that Mr Javier Solana clearly stated to the committee that there was no evidence of the colourful stories we were being told , the report accuses EU governments both of violating human rights and of lying .
in foreign policy , we need to do what we have undertaken to do in the various areas – our commitments to combat Aids , action measures in Kosovo , and cooperation with non-governmental organisations in strengthening democracy .
that requires rules and conditions , which , on the other hand , we want to keep to a necessary minimum .
indeed , I can only endorse its conclusions , which recommend , and I quote : ‘ radically changing the European Union ’ s trade policies ’ .
( for the results and other details on the vote : see minutes )
that is the gist of the amendment submitted by the Liberal Group and which Mrs Spaak would have defended if she had been here today .
quality argues for itself .
I have two questions , Commissioner ; one is on the quick-start money .
our partnership has not , however , been without its problems , and it is pleasing that , at the summit on 10 May , we succeeded in agreeing upon cooperation within the Four Common Spaces .
for this I would refer to the Commission once again , as indeed he did himself in his more detailed question .
in the course of our work , we received several kilos of documentation from the Commission , the Council , government bodies , and national and international scientific institutions .
there are reasons for migration flows .
Mr President , I sincerely hope that during your term in office you will advocate greater involvement by the twelve new Member States in the shaping of European policies .
I know from experience that a colonoscopy is not a pleasant examination , even if it can be very beneficial to human health .
for this reason , I believe that a common approach should be considered .
( DE ) Madam President , Baroness Ashton , ladies and gentlemen , as shadow rapporteur , I would first of all like to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur , Mr Albertini , for his very positive cooperation on this report .
indeed , many of the amendments I have tabled have been co-signed by her group and mine .
we still have a great many reports on the agenda and a good many speakers , so we will not finish by midnight otherwise .
there are some of us who have tried to obtain such a solution .
a proposal for legislation on the statute of the company was formally requested in February 2007 , on the basis of Article 192 of the Treaty and - as I would like to stress , and I would ask the Commissioner to listen because this is a very important oral question , Mr President , to which an answer must be given - after a thorough debate , together with a hearing with qualified and representative experts who showed us how necessary such an instrument was and how useful it would be in fostering small enterprises keen to operate effectively in the internal market .
it would not be appropriate to single out specific areas in particular need of funding .
as the honourable Member mentioned , at the Brussels meeting in March 2003 , the European Council stressed the role of the Competitiveness Council formation , stating that it should be effectively consulted within the Council &apos;s decision-making processes on proposals considered likely to have substantial effects on competitiveness , alongside the responsibility of all Council formations to assess the impact of their work field .
the Commission does not consider that EURODAC is a measure to build on the Schengen acquis under Article B of the Danish protocol .
Parliament was quite right to underline the difficulties that small and medium-sized enterprises have in accessing this programme , and the new text will quite specifically make it easier for them .
as a member of the European Parliament &apos;s ad hoc delegation on Chechnya , I am disappointed about the cancellation of our delegation visit , which had been confirmed with the Duma .
secondly , the principle of open competition in the European energy market .
referendums are simply not the solution .
I wish Council and Commission persistence in the search for a well nigh impossible political settlement between Russians and Chechens .
I really do appreciate the efforts that have gone into this report , particularly the work done by the rapporteur , Mr Wijkman .
I must inform Parliament that I am opposed to most of the amendments concerning chemicals .
as Mr Tannock rightly said , we should not marginalise Tajikistan .
for this reason , I agree that external pipelines and other energy networks entering the territory of the European Union should be governed by transparent intergovernmental agreements , drawn up strictly in accordance with EU legislation .
the Commission will keep a close eye on developments in Russia .
we should prepare ourselves to welcome them in the same way as they make efforts to meet our demanding standards .
and personally I think one of the things to be discussed in this setting is precisely whether it is possible to agree a re-run of the election .
let me point out that regardless of these events the Commission will continue its critical dialogue with the Slovak Government .
however , I would still like to point out the difference between traceability on the one hand and consumer confidence on the other .
&apos; We can smell Italian food , &apos; they said , &apos; we can smell Parmigiano Reggiano cheese , Parma ham and steaming spaghetti .
if there is a Summit tomorrow , they should get up early or arrange things in some other way ; but where they should be today is here .
Mr President , I voted in favour of this resolution because I recognise that the free movement of persons is a fundamental principle of the European Union and one which must be respected and defended by all Member States .
furthermore , will all agreements between the European Union and individual countries that wish to enter into them be model agreements and agreements with equal , high and clear standards for the use and protection of data ?
one sign that we could give would be to abolish the visa requirement for Macedonia at long last .
that is why I welcome the reports by Mrs Grüber and Mr Moreno Sánchez , especially the report on immigration policy , because its premises civilise immigration by creating channels for legal immigration .
Western countries have never accepted that contradiction and we are now seeing its dramatic effects .
let us hope that the Governor of the State of Virginia will at least take into account the appeal from the Pope , if not the appeals which have been made by individuals and Parliaments , Governments and moral authorities .
not every media service is of major importance in publicity terms , so the determinative criterion for the future must be the extent to which a media service is useful for publicity purposes and in what sense it is not .
it might even be tempting to make the Commission the bad guy .
there are pictures of many people .
these are serious problems , and they are serious in Estonia too .
it is , indeed , wonderful .
the Commission has made an extensive declaration on this ethical framework , which will be published in the Official Journal as part of the Framework Programme 7 package .
that is an old English saying .
we expect the new Palestinian Government – sworn in last week – to commit to the principles of non-violence , recognition of Israel and acceptance of previous agreements and obligations , including the roadmap , which then bind the Palestinian Authority to the fundamental principles of peace , democracy , respect for the rule of law and human rights .
with regard to classifications for coastal waters , we support the distinction between it and fresh waters , as coastal waters have lower permissible levels of contamination than those for inland waters .
( applause )
- ( FR ) Mr President , I should like to draw the European Parliament &apos;s attention to the deterioration - if such a thing were still possible - of the human rights situation in Tunisia .
and I believe that even the Commission did not know what it was , because we were entering unknown territory .
Mr President , speaking personally and on behalf of my Group I must congratulate you on your reelection as vice-president of Parliament .
Mr President , the International Olympic Committee justified their granting of the 2008 Olympic Games to China by claiming that this would help open the country up to improvements in its human rights situation .
thanks once again and congratulations to Mrs Krehl on her report .
this programme is designed , therefore , to support the application of protection and of the fight against social exclusion , especially of minority groups , and improvements to the working environment , supplemented by the provision for combining family life and work so that women are given the opportunity to participate in the workplace .
I do not think she is a fit and proper person to do this job .
also , in the area of private financing for the health service , there must be a risk equalisation element whereby , if you bring in a private health insurer for the health care system , they must take the same risk as existing insurers or the state , which means covering everyone and all sections of society .
( the Minutes of the previous sitting were approved )
that really demonstrates our need for EU Council meetings to be held in public .
I believe that the actions of France , Germany and Belgium in fomenting division within the Alliance over the crucial issue of Turkey &apos;s security are nothing short of deplorable .
the initial problem is that of definition .
( DE ) Mr President , Mr Gloser , Commissioner , it is important to recall today the pictures we have all seen in the newspapers and on television .
if anyone had said back in 1993 that Greece would achieve these objectives in just 7 years , they would have been laughed at .
let us not be naïve and delude ourselves : aeroplanes are not bananas and tanks are not refrigerators .
capital that is invested through this programme is no more designed to develop poor countries now than it was in the past , since they are dependent on European capital .
the most important thing I wanted to say is that I am against Amendment No 4 .
I hope that these radical and misplaced ideologies will not be included in the report .
let me mention the exchange issue , which is very important .
the first is : what steps does the Commission intend to take by November of this year , when a new Commission takes office , to put an end to the current practice , and when , precisely ?
this is also , in fact , the basis for my reply to Mr Markov .
the European Union has already banned the use of mercury and materials containing mercury on its territory .
moreover , I have to tell the House that , if you do not wish to be dependent on Russian energy , you must put an end to the waste of energy in Europe , in the US and in the industrialised nations of the world .
the future objective 2 policy in particular will enable us , in partnership with the regions and governments , to implement directly the major objectives of Göteborg and Lisbon relating to competitiveness and sustainable growth .
we should be very uneasy about this .
Mr President , I represent Northern Ireland in this House , a region which , as everyone will know , has suffered decades of vicious terrorism .
we have now strengthened the status of the elderly and disabled in particular , and I think that is a humane and proper goal .
when it was voted on in the Legal Affairs Committee there was consensus on many individual points .
I admire Commissioner Monti and the way he has resisted the pressure from the alcohol and tobacco industries to try and have this decision reversed .
the fifth issue is that of fund processing , in respect of which the industry is making promising efforts , and so we should place our trust in it and take it as read that it will sort out the problems on its own initiative .
I am confident that strengthening the relations between the EU and Serbia and Montenegro , through the conclusion of the Stability and Association Agreement , will help consolidate democracy and the rule of law , which will also be to the benefit of the ethnic minorities .
in some areas , we do have a common policy , while in other areas , we do not .
you also know that it should be borne in mind in this context that social policy measures are not geared to ethnic origin , but always to individual needs .
it is therefore a particular pleasure for me to be able to express the Commission &apos;s opinion on this topic .
in this regard , I support all of the financial backing that can be given to them , on the part of Community or national institutions .
however , I must point out that the Commission is not entirely happy with the package deal made between Parliament and the Council during their trialogue with the Commission .
I will end by referring to the two problems which I believe will be the crux of the debate in conciliation .
( applause ) Now to the follow-up to Nice .
there were therefore several points which were agreed pending - and this was clearly specified in the text - the arrival of international observers .
we should , therefore , bear in mind some aspects that should not be forgotten :
this is in itself a major problem because , in tackling such an essential area as public access to , and scrutiny of , documents - which is fundamental to our having democratically active citizens able to influence the decision-making process - it is crucial to involve people , partly in the debate as to how the rules are to be designed , and perhaps , in addition , to go so far as to listen to some of people &apos; s objections .
they have received nothing , and instead of thanking these people for their self-sacrifice , the Hungarian Government made the baffling decision to disband the Hungarian Guard .
in this area , solidarity clearly also means striking a balance between our fellow citizens ’ right to be given guarantees against people traffickers and protecting the victims of people traffickers , in other words the immigrants or asylum seekers themselves .
since taking office , I have experienced the willingness of many Union institutions and bodies to cooperate with the Ombudsman .
because I want to pay tribute to the support this House has given to my initiative , and because I want to hear your views and talk to you before I meet the Heads of State and Government .
I would like to thank the Commissioner for being among the politicians emphasising the importance of the European Parliament to the forthcoming summit and to climate policy and climate change in themselves .
I am , however , unable to agree with several of the proposals for amendments in which doubts are expressed as to whether climate change is really happening , the importance of fossil fuels and nuclear energy is emphasised and the development of renewable energy is ridiculed .
I hope this will now change with the publication of the new policy framework by the Commission and its proposed programme of action for the years 2001-2006 .
if we want lasting peace in this region , if we do not want discrimination and violence against the poorest to become even more widespread in these countries , we need to involve the regional organisations , and in particular the African Union , in our action .
education was successful under Erasmus , but I think that , embedded in the Socrates programme , it has fared even better .
thank you , President-in-Office .
I acknowledge that the report is better than the original version that was rejected in the parliamentary committee , but nevertheless , I wish to make some observations on my own behalf and on behalf of my group .
let it be clear that the least developed countries are hit hardest , and that is why these diseases are termed diseases of poverty .
there is therefore no point in making assistants who work here , for example , subject to Belgian law .
in conclusion , I re-emphasise that the Commission will not draw any definitive conclusions in the area of services of general economic interest before it has presented its conclusions on the consultation on the Green Paper , which it intends to submit during the month of April , which is exactly what Parliament has requested .
does it include telephone meetings and Internet meetings ?
but the core question is : who is responsible ?
recently the subject of posts in Parliament has arisen once again .
I would like to say once again that my sympathy this morning is with these people .
I congratulate Mr Sousa Pinto and Mr Turco .
the European Union has nothing to do with this incident and has found itself hostage to an issue between two third countries .
53rd session of the UN Human Rights Commission -B4-0063 / 97 by Mr Bertens and Mrs Larive , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party , on China and the United Nations Human Rights Commission ; -B4-0077 / 97 by Mr Barros Moura and others , on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , on the 53rd session of the UN Human Rights Commission ; -B4-0091 / 97 by Mr Pasty and others , on behalf of the Union for Europe Group , on the 53rd session of the UN Human Rights Commission ; -B4-0094 / 97 by Mr Dupuis and Mr Dell &apos;Alba , on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance , on the resolution on China / Tibet in the UN Human Rights Commission and on the standpoint of the UN Member States ; -B4-0111 / 97 by Mrs Lenz and others , on behalf of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party , on the 53rd session of the UN Human Rights Commission ; -B4-0123 / 97 by Mr Carnero González and others , on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left on human rights - Geneva ; -B4-0142 / 97 by Mrs Müller and others , on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament , on the 53rd session of the UN Human Rights Commission ; -B4-0062 / 97 by Mr Cars and others , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party , on the abolition of the death penalty ; -B4-0095 / 97 by Mr Dupuis and others , on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance , on the most frequent cases in many countries throughout the world in which the death penalty is imposed ; -B4-0124 / 97 by Mr Carnero González and others , on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left , on the UN Human Rights Commission and on the abolition of the death penalty ; -B4-0134 / 97 by Mrs Aglietta and others , on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament , on the death penalty ; -B4-0098 / 97 by Mr Dupuis and Mr Dell &apos;Alba , on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance , on the grave human rights violations in western Turkestan ( Xinjian ) ;
as you recognised , Prime Minister , in the Laeken Declaration in 2001 , the European Union has been talking more to itself than to its citizens .
the report is a balanced assessment of the events surrounding the Prestige disaster and contains sound recommendations , whether on the prevention of such problems in the future or on ways of managing them more effectively .
politically , though , I fundamentally object to her interfering with national , public broadcasting .
I also cast my mind back to Alcide De Gasperi , who was born Austrian and served as an Austrian parliamentarian in the time of the Austro-Hungarian Empire , before becoming an Italian one .
I feel I must point something out : for years now this annual report has been getting more and more like a copy of itself .
setting aside ECU 9 million for such initiatives is not enough .
my preference is for the existing paragraph 17 , which states that we should evaluate our political priorities , then their needs , and only then should Parliament decide on what the level of own resources should be .
the effort which the Union is making in this matter will be the best catalyst for a process of political union , a union of citizens and peoples .
this stance is also reflected in the European Union water initiative .
I do not understand .
I am a loyal customer of question time .
do you wish to vote by roll-call ?
reality is obstinate .
this is just one example of the positive benefits the European Union brings to its citizens .
there is great fear , particularly on the part of Romania and Bulgaria , of being put on the shelf .
our children must never again suffer such terrible afflictions and we must do all we can to prevent this .
( DE ) We take the current and future problems of pensions policy and social change very seriously .
the joint amendment that is before us does not create new rights .
I hope I can count on its result and be confident in this respect , given the very positive content of the motion for a resolution which is already on the agenda .
that happened on Maundy Thursday .
politicians from certain countries , whose own language is , in their opinion , the most important one in the world , have claimed that we will destroy the internal market in this area if we enter into enhanced cooperation .
I personally cannot support this proposal .
we have signalled clearly that we would like to see Belarus take its place as a fully fledged participant in the European neighbourhood policy , and that the bilateral track of the Eastern Partnership can be opened to Belarus if it shows through sustained action its wish to make irreversible steps towards democratic reform .
this consultation is also an opportunity to recall our concerns at the time when the text was being signed .
our Rules of Procedure state that Commissioners may speak for as long as they wish .
for the GSP to become a mechanism of development aid , there will be a need , as we propose , to abolish and then renegotiate both it and other policies for development assistance , forming an effective solidarity , and combating economic dependency and the exploitation of people and natural resources by economic groups within the EU .
we believe that the Commission should have a full Commissioner ( with voting rights ) for each Member State .
however , I am not so enthusiastic about some of the amendments , whose authors seem to think that health warnings covering 25 % of the total packet surface for tobacco products will make people give up smoking .
in Sudan one in ten children die during the first year of life and one in seven die before they reach the age of five .
it would be absurd if , in a situation where there was over-capacity when the new multi-annual guidelines were being discussed , we were to continue to allow the use of non-selective fishing techniques .
what kind of good management - sustainable management of fisheries - do you call that ?
these include the climate , biodiversity and the eutrophication of waterways .
or , does it mean that Poland and the British Government simply pay lip-service to those values but then deny their citizens the means to enforce their rights ?
furthermore , how do you see the challenge for the Eighth Framework Programme for Research , where the idea of us providing EUR 50 billion in future for research into energy efficiency , in particular , in relation to SMEs , is being discussed .
as I also stated in the House , we will make sure that a good report about the important subject of women and health comes back to the House as soon as possible , and I assume that Mrs van Dijk will follow these events closely .
however , Mr Prodi must understand that he cannot be President of the Commission and , at the same time , a party leader in Italy .
the Republic of Korea has long been a regional leader on human rights issues in Asia .
as you perhaps know , the Commission has now , in the course of the week , adopted a new directive which will further improve access to environmental information .
you were the cause of your own failure .
in that connection , land is still to lie fallow or be set aside on a rotating basis .
the actual restrictions make sense given mercury &apos;s increasing toxicity , although I would have liked to see more far-reaching restrictions in many areas .
the Commission has explained very clearly that this is an area which will attract a great deal of attention during membership negotiations .
we therefore consider it unacceptable to keep this proposal and we think that we will have to vote against it .
I think that there is also a need to highlight , as some of my colleagues have done , the importance of the European Commission presenting studies assessing the impact of the GSP in the beneficiary countries .
the result of this process represents a victory for Parliament and is a positive sign of our attention to citizens &apos; needs .
we note that a majority of the amendments suggested by the European Parliament at first reading have been adopted by the Council .
take the way in which theme parks are treated in one country ...
the removal of the travel visa to the United States is a very important priority for our citizens and we are mistaken if we think that it is not .
it could also mean fair prices - which is not unimportant given that public service contracts involve taxpayers &apos; money - with the right , though , to include social and environmental criteria at the tendering stage .
I am delighted that these ideas meet with general approval .
some deliverables are expected as early as April next year and I am confident that solutions can be found on outstanding issues .
I was listening very carefully for the bell because I had a meeting .
I would ask colleagues on the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety to pursue this breach of EU law by the British Government and request that the Commission investigate it .
with a view to exploring the American position and the possibilities of solving the problem , the Commission has , at the request of the Member States , entered into informal discussions with Washington .
Parliament also sent a delegation to Chechnya the year before last , and I was its chairman .
in the same way , companies need to be jointly and severally liable towards their sub-contractors .
are we really getting value for money ?
we are actually unaware of how many of our citizens are being held in Guantánamo together with citizens of other countries around the world . I find the situation quite unacceptable .
the victims , the damage suffered and the need for reforestation do not have any understanding of bureaucracy or of budget shortages .
the report by Werner Langen , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the proposal for a Council decision in accordance with Article 122 ( 2 ) of the Treaty on the adoption by Cyprus of the single currency on 1 January 2008 - C6-0151 / 2007 - , and
this damages businesses , intellectual property , research and - as always - the consumer .
Member of the Commission .
at the end of the previous sitting we had a very long series of points of order .
whatever your views on this source of power and electricity , it is a fact that it supplies a significant part of our electricity in Europe and it does so in a way which does not produce CO2 or other greenhouse gas emissions and that is why - and the only reason - it has been mentioned in this report .
I commit myself to continuing the dialogue between our institutions within and beyond the formal procedures .
of course , this cannot be allowed .
Lisbon wishes to fight against impoverishment in Europe and for greater social justice .
we support Parliament &apos;s decision to reform the hearing procedure in a way that will further increase the transparency and the democratic legitimacy of the appointment procedure by establishing clear , transparent and uniform procedures and evaluation criteria .
Mr Claeys , I have heard of the events you are talking about , but cannot give a view on the substance of what you say has occurred .
this is why there was a need to revise its basic regulations , notably by redefining the key terms and in particular the actual concept of the project , as the Commission &apos;s proposal suggests .
no-one talks about the psychological damage to the &apos; comfort women &apos; themselves .
the next item is voting time .
( DE ) Madam President , I did not vote for the resolution on Turkey because I am greatly concerned that the Turkish Parliament has agreed a military strike against Iraq . This could not be taken into account in the report , but is a very topical issue .
the Commission has thoroughly monitored the steps taken .
thirdly , the Dutch minister argues for &quot; a more effective international effort to promote a healthy institutional and democratic development of the Palestinian administration &quot; .
you are quite right , Mr Blokland .
all of this , in any case , must not get out of hand to the extent that buildings on which excellent energy efficiency renovation work has been carried out stand empty because the rent rises exorbitantly .
I would particularly like to draw attention to the fact that there are three Member States mentioned in the report in which the situation is significantly worse , worse enough for them to be singled out in the report .
the need to improve the reporting system stems from the change in the energy situation at a time when energy interdependency between states has increased and we have an internal market .
I am very much obliged to our friend Mr El Khadraoui for his excellent resolution , which - I believe - will be adopted tomorrow by a large majority in the spirit of our discussions .
the problem is that national legislation in the Member States either does not exist or has not been harmonized in a common direction , along common political lines which would make it easier to solve these problems .
point 3 ( B ) very clearly states that &apos; catch the eye &apos; time is a maximum of five minutes , and is limited to a maximum of one minute per speaker .
with the enlargement and extension of Europe , we need more people whose hearts are in Europe and who have a feel for Europe , together with a knowledge of , and a feel for , the various countries , languages and cultures .
if one is dealing with Parliament , one learns that this place attaches primary importance to compromises , and it is compromises that we have worked towards very intensively .
in these conditions , and in order to increase the security of forthcoming elections , the UN has sought the help of the European Union , as you mentioned .
question No 13 by ( H-0499 / 99 ) :
Mr President , as a logical extension of our vote in favour of the Schulz report and the many debates we have had since the terrible Dutroux affair , I would like to make the following suggestion : removing from article 6 of the new treaty on non-discrimination the very ambiguous concept of sexual orientation , because it can justify anything , and keeping to what already appears in this article , that is , non-discrimination based on gender .
 
in my view , the Treaty of Amsterdam is inadequate in some respects ; it has both good and bad points . However , it has allowed us to make significant progress in the area of citizenship , although it is currently difficult to assess the full scope and implications of this .
the Commission will cooperate fully with the Presidency and Parliament to seek political agreement on directives between the Council and Parliament .
we shall therefore proceed to the vote .
I see it as a great personal challenge to ensure that that does not happen , which is why Mr Fischler and I have today presented the communication , which states , amongst other things , that intensive agriculture conflicts with the EU &apos;s ambitions for the environment and that a further effort must be made if drinking water and biodiversity are to be safeguarded .
it is this particular feature that justifies this specific request .
the Danish Social Democrats voted for the Mulder report on agricultural products and agri-foodstuffs today .
the guidelines , as adopted by the Commission , are very limited because , instead of meeting the aim of providing guidance , they are providing a shopping list of possible measures , a shopping list which , as it fails to set priorities in ascending order , could even put the Member States on the wrong track by guiding them towards a series of proposals that is at odds with the desired concentration .
my countrymen want an honest answer to the question of what the EU thinks it is and what happened to the concept of trade .
– Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I find your programme clear , practical and credible , which has not been the case with all presidencies .
as a Portuguese citizen and having enjoyed direct constitutional responsibility for Macau , I must state that Macau &apos; s handover from Portuguese administration to the Chinese was done consensually and with enormous goodwill under the terms of the 1987 Joint Sino-Portuguese Declaration , which is still in force today and which will remain so for the next fifty years .
we might also ask how Parliament in future will manage its enormous task if it tackles issues so meticulously .
fishing in general , and small-scale fishing in particular , are , in Europe , in danger of dying out .
I am gratified to note that the report on rural development , one of the most important areas where reforms are needed , will shortly be completed .
it should certainly be the main criterion , but not the only one .
( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , a few months after Professor Monti &apos;s report , which called for a necessary recovery of the citizen-oriented internal market , I welcome the Commission &apos;s response .
however , this is causing a problem for the many people who now live there .
does the Council believe that there is now adequate protection for European businessmen who have invested or who are intending to invest in Cuba following the Commission &apos;s recent decision to halt the proceedings it brought before the World Trade Organization against the United States regarding the Helms-Burton Law ?
discussions over the Services Directive have already revealed absurd situations in connection with transitional periods and now , with regard to Directive 109 , it also appears that a legal conflict has arisen with the preferential rules clause .
fine , let us talk about policy , but first of all , if there is a structure , if there are rules , they have to be respected .
this is important because it is so closely related to the economic and monetary policy of the Union , because it is an incentive for structural change in budget management in many of our economies , because there is an economic slowdown and because it has provoked a debate about how to respond .
with regard to cross-border crisis , I share Parliament &apos;s view on the need to have clarity about burden-sharing and the interactions between all involved parties before such a crisis occurs .
thirdly , this justifies our reinforcing our horizontal measures and the aid we base on territorial areas , the environment , forests , the diversification of the productive fabric of the most highly-dependent agricultural regions , animal and vegetable health , and aid related to employment and the less favoured areas .
I do not know about them .
let us bring it all down to earth just a little bit shall we ?
the push for the independence of Kosovo , the discussion of the revision of the Dayton accords and the reference to functional problems in Serbia-Montenegro confirm the new cycle of border changes .
in terms of EU exports , it ranks on a par with India and ahead of countries such as Canada or Korea .
I too would like everyone to recognise that , and we want Member States to be able to continue to organise in different ways .
we are in a bipartite situation and we are hardly going to find a solution to it right away .
it is not right in such a difficult situation for Parliament to demand a 6 % increase in the budget .
I would ask the services to ensure that all the linguistic versions take what you have said into account .
it is wrong and ill-informed .
we must avoid trying for a sectorial harmonization of the social conditions in the electricity industry .
as we are all aware , these circumstances combined to create unnecessary tension . This was not at all helpful as we sought to achieve our aim : establishing a unified legal status for all Members .
there is also a fundamental difference in the structure of central securities depositories in continental Europe on the one hand and the Nordic countries on the other , in that information on the investor in the Nordic central securities depositories is entered directly into the system and also , except in Denmark , directly into the issuer &apos;s register of shareholders .
Madam President , we must bear in mind that the powers of investigation and control available to the supervisory authorities in the financial field are incomparably greater than those which exist in other fields .
we need to send a clear message here . We want to roll back bureaucracy and we want to maintain hygiene standards .
the need for further clarification and simplification of the new Community legislation was also stressed . To this end , guidelines on the quality of drafting Community legislation were to be adopted .
the audit numbers purely and simply do not tell the whole truth on the use of resources , therefore : they also comprise political elements .
I think you said EUR 800 .
that is dealt with in another Committee proposal on the common organization of tobacco production and it would not be good to mix up comments and amendments here on this matter , because then we can devalue the strategy of combatting tobacco consumption .
the fact that the Commission ignored not just its opposite number , but also Parliament , when it was preparing the EU Strategy for Africa in 2005 , has , unfortunately , been a common approach for the Commission .
for years now , the area around Gibraltar has been the scene of constant discharges of oil into the sea during the refuelling , loading and unloading of vessels .
even today , these prejudices persist , as do the consequences that have historically been inherent to them : even today , the Roma are one of the communities with the lowest levels of schooling and the highest rates of criminality .
the peoples of Israel and Palestine are equal in dignity ; they are entitled to live within secure borders .
I would like to say to Mrs Petre that I consider this to be a regional policy report .
even though I would endorse the report in the light of the undeniable need for the European dimension of political parties at the very moment the Convention is launching the Constitutional draft for the European Union , the system actually proposed can hardly hide the inner tendency to transfer the American way of doing politics to the European landscape .
in that way we create a system which has a high degree of legitimacy and is democratically anchored .
we want to support it even after that date , but we do need agreement by then .
even if Russia does its homework , we cannot go on assuming that IMF policy will automatically put things right .
we are therefore waiting for tangible proof from the European Commission .
I come from a country which , in the 1970s , made a choice : the choice not to build a single nuclear power station on the river Moselle .
in order to safeguard their livelihood and also to safeguard employment , the lower rate for hand-rolling tobacco was deemed necessary .
I would like to take this opportunity to say a word or two on the reasons leading us to believe that we are looking at a case of what we call fumus persecutionis , that is to say , something which , in legal proceedings , gives the impression that something is going on other than the desire to see justice done in a dispassionate and normal fashion .
I think you are missing the point and I think , with respect , our rapporteur is also missing the point .
a Member of this House is exploiting his parliamentary rights in order to spy on colleagues in the most unworthy and disgusting way .
time has moved on .
we also know that the report glosses over the problems involved here , e.g. the question of subsidies from public funds , the question of the potential risks of nuclear power stations that are ostensibly running normally .
companies will not become safer and more competitive if we hide these responsibilities .
this is a situation which runs totally counter to our European farm model which is based on a multiplicity of diversified and multifunctional family farms .
we do not meet any other country so frequently , yet problems persist .
in this context , there are three situations that I think we must consider . The first is the need to provide a response , to legislate on the operational funds for producers &apos; organisations .
it will provide farmers with the opportunity to diversify - something that they have continually been urged to do by respective Member State governments and by the European Parliament - to produce new employment possibilities .
the Commission is happy to accept all the amendments .
thank you , Commissioner .
it is becoming very difficult for the people in such countries to understand whether the European Union is implementing a policy of poverty reduction or actually increasing poverty in the social area .
I shall listen closely to your reply .
as regards implementation and follow-up , I consider it very important that not only the Commission but also national parliaments bear a major responsibility for this , as it goes without saying that these expulsions must also be implemented effectively .
I believe that this does not give us a parity of weapons with our main competitors .
the current regulation affects 100 % of the distribution contracts .
with regard to the aforementioned report , one of the Copenhagen criteria stipulates that the Member States must respect minorities and national minorities in particular , and highlights some of the progress which has been made by the candidate states .
I now give the floor to Mr Prodi , President of the Commission .
the Commission decided not to lodge an appeal against the judgment of the Court of First Instance of 13 June 2006 .
the European Year of People with Disabilities is in full swing .
citizens with fewer social advantages , who have to make great sacrifices to enable their state to fulfil the Maastricht criteria , have no sympathy at all for the fact that criminal individuals or institutions can indirectly become wealthy at their cost .
or could it be ( in the mind of the Deputy Prime Minister ) on account of the attractiveness of a tax which , according to estimates , could bring in between 50 and 250 billion dollars per year , possibly for allocation to development-aid programmes in the world &apos;s poorest countries ?
please God .
does the right to take industrial action also apply to public sector employees ?
that is how territorial cohesion will come to represent a clear basis that all Europeans can understand for increasing cohesion within the territory of the EU .
therefore , for humanitarian and social reasons , the most important matter is not to combat the highly unlikely causes of climate change , but to combat the results of climate change .
as was stated in Lisbon , Europe wants to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world .
how can we tackle more successfully such issues as education , employment , gender equality , democracy , the free movement of persons , and migration rights ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , enlargement of the European Union to the CEECs and Cyprus is certainly one of the most important challenges for the future of the European institutions .
about ECU 1 billion is paid to tobacco growers in the Union every year , whilst the smoking of tobacco causes diseases and human suffering .
Dr Blix , for example , has stated that these conditions have not been met , and so it is a good thing that the efforts of many have gained us a breathing space , time that must be used to find a peaceful solution , by which I mean the dismantling of the weapons of mass destruction - insofar as they actually exist - and the disarmament of Iraq , thus enabling the will of the international community , as expressed in international law , to prevail .
giving in to national misgivings would further widen the gap between Europe and its nations .
I am very pleased that this was not set as a new accession criterion .
I am voting against , but not against the Czech Republic itself . Rather , I am voting against the circumstances in which this enlargement is set to take place , as I made clear in my explanation of vote on the Brok report .
this is what needs to fundamentally change in the European Union .
the Commission wants to extend the economic accounts to key aspects of sustainable development .
it considers that the request of the Pakistani Government regarding the detainees is groundless and unprecedented in international law .
the question has been put to the Ombudsman .
could you please pass this request on to the Presidency .
my second point is that , when we give money - with a pretty generous heart - to third countries , to those that are underdeveloped and less privileged , I would like to get some feedback on how that money is used , in particular under those soft programmes like democratisation or similar , which do not produce tangible things but change minds , or entrepreneurship .
it needs more imagination and more innovation .
the next item is the report ( A4-0348 / 96 ) by Mr Manzella , on behalf of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure , the Verification of Credentials and Immunities , on amendment of Rule 49 of Parliament &apos;s Rules of Procedure ( annual legislative programme ) .
in the case of the modification of the Directive on the common rules and standards for organisations which classify , inspect and examine ships on behalf of the maritime administration , from the outset , the parliamentary amendments to Commission &apos; s original proposal focussed , above all , on the practical aspects of the application of the classification system , on improving the transparency of the information relating to the quality of inspections , on the periodic auditing of those organisations and the withdrawal of their Community recognition in the event of serious accidents , as well as the financial liability of those organisations for damages and accidents where is has been proved that that there has been negligence in inspections .
Protocol 7 says , I quote : &apos; for the avoidance of doubt , nothing in Title IV of the Charter creates justiciable rights applicable to Poland or the United Kingdom &apos; .
I feel I speak for many when I say that it cannot be taken for granted .
I am also aware that air transport is not without risks .
the Commission continues to attach great importance to the issue of conflict prevention .
you need to bear in mind that before data protection was introduced in Europe , the Americans already had far more stringent data protection arrangements than we have , combined with strict rules about passing on data to third parties .
I believe that a directive on the subject can be justified if it brings real benefits to consumers who buy goods across borders - but this directive does not do so .
that is a blurring that we welcome , but also a blurring that is unwelcome if the legal framework for these new forms is not clear .
this is the least we could have done at this conference .
my group gives its support to the extension of the applicability of the Fund &apos;s resources to major disasters in accordance with the amendment brought in by the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism and is in consequence opposed to the Council &apos;s preference for concentrating on natural disasters .
Mr Friedrich is putting forward an ambitious , long and substantial resolution .
at that time too , all the organisations , rules and interests formed a complex whole .
I would also say that you are entirely mistaken if you think that better translation rights are any sort of cure at all for this flawed piece of legislation which is ruining people &apos;s lives .
in order to achieve this , it is sometimes necessary to take measures that do not appear liberal , such as prescribing fixed rates for transmissions for all users and producers , for this is absolutely vital to grant newcomers access to the market .
as in the case of the smuggling of migrants , the European Union also signed an additional protocol on trafficking of persons .
indeed , in this recovery plan , the Commission has recommended actions falling under the four priority areas of the Lisbon Strategy : individuals , businesses , infrastructure and energy , and research and innovation .
first , the Union must be given the instruments and procedures necessary for this area without frontiers to be an area for work , business , tourism and culture , but not an area for terrorism , drug-trafficking , slave trade and abuse of women and children , immigration and clandestine labour mafias , and all the other forms of organized crime .
in Mr Moscovici and Mr Van Orden ’ s reports , and also in the recommendations , we want to have a reference to the exchange of letters between you and the President of the Commission on the full association of the European Parliament in the forthcoming process over the next 20 months concerning safeguard clauses .
please .
I would like to inform you that today , the Commission will appoint an Anti-Trafficking Coordinator , who will take office in the next month .
can the Commission tell me where I can see them , where they have been published ?
I do not share his views on the legal basis .
we actually asked for an independent evaluation of an independent evaluation report on the programme .
we are not only discussing the budgets of this and all the other institutions for next year , we are also looking back to the launch of the European Coal and Steel Community in order to perform the annual exercise of winding up the financial part of the old Treaty .
this is also the starting point for renewed political dialogue with Slovakia , for example , a process which I personally am very much involved with in that country .
subject : Halting the stoning-to-death of Nigerian mother Safiya Yakuba Hussaini
it means uniting the different communities of Iraq and the building of stable institutions to secure the future .
the question that I should like to put to you , as President-designate , is this : how do you believe you will respond to these major priorities of the European Union through vague proclamations when your policy , all these years , has constantly served different perceptions ?
do we realise that visa liberalisation - which I have heard said will be used only by students and respectable people , even though I personally do not agree at all with that optimistic statement - will simply mean that Europe becomes a hotbed of Roma ?
it has to be integrated at the very start of the process of preparing different proposals .
on the issues of optionality and the distinction between manufacturers and traders – Amendment No 32 and Commissioner Liikanen ’ s statement play a key role here – there was vigorous debate about whether the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy would be willing , yet again , to conclude the matter through an informal trialogue during the second reading .
.
besides , I am aware that the same concerns voiced by Mrs Lulling have also been voiced specifically at a local level by economic and political actors .
as I advocate compliance with and respect for the Treaty of Lisbon , I am voting in favour of Parliament having a clear position on the assertion of its powers and responsibilities , and taking an active role in promoting EU policies which are capable of ensuring effective support for democracy , freedom and respect for human rights worldwide .
Mr President , the directive on ozone in ambient air is intended to provide a response to the problem of tropospheric ozone produced and trapped in the air around the earth &apos; s surface which , as we all know , has damaging effects on both human health and on the planet &apos; s vegetation , ecosystems and on the environment as a whole .
it is a splendid concept , but a dangerous one too : splendid because it is more effective , if properly applied , than constantly introducing new pieces of legislation ; and dangerous because it can serve as a lightning conductor , a sop , a paper tiger .
I would like to conclude by saying that our Committee on Women &apos;s Rights and Equal Opportunities is going to have a major part to play in verifying the implementation of Mrs Gröner &apos;s report .
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Costa , on his work , as well as the representatives of the political groups , Mr Jarzembowski and Mr El Khadraoui , who , together with our rapporteur , formed the core of our negotiating group .
Mr President , a secure social welfare system is an important part of a democracy but it is primarily the responsibility of Member States .
ECB annual report
are the authors maintaining the resolution or taking my advice , which I spelled out in detail , that this should be withdrawn for a month ?
we believe that such aid should quickly be cut back on and completely abolished before long .
a third of the telephone price consists of interconnection money , so at European level this is billions of ecus .
it is therefore to be hoped that the Council will be able to reach a deal on the financial package , the CAP and the institutional issues without delay .
protecting our own market under the guise of safety and security makes no sense and is , as far as I am concerned , an admission of weakness .
the EU will change dramatically in the next few years , and the main task during the next term of office will be to make this enlarged Europe work .
the next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
this assessment is not overly enthusiastic because , although it reports on progress made , it also highlights the fact that a great deal is still to be done in various areas .
there are dozens more such irrelevant and interfering items of EU legislation on the stocks .
the Commission falls very short of this in the White Paper .
I believe that Israel must expect to pay for the reconstruction of Lebanon .
.
it would be wrong if operators believed that network sharing deserves different treatment under competition law provisions .
why not propose a European mini-income tax ?
high level representation alone is not enough ; adequate tools for action are needed .
I would , though , be very wary of involving Moscow in this process , as Moscow , being the former colonial power , of course bears some responsibility for what is happening in Belarus today .
the one exception I just mentioned , where the Commission explicitly needs a positive opinion of the committee before being authorised to adopt the draft implementing act , relates to definitive multilateral trade safeguard measures .
and we have done just that .
I must say , my enthusiasm declined to some extent by the end , since I myself realised how many obstacles there are to engaging in active dialogue with citizens , and how far removed the bureaucratic machinery of the European Union is from the daily lives and wishes of its citizens .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
the European Council of 21 September sent out a very clear message to us .
I think that it is a virus gnawing away at European solidarity : we must eradicate it .
thank you Mr President .
would it not therefore be easier to dissolve the people and elect another in their place ?
the rules must therefore be tightened up and Parliament &apos;s departments will have to take more consistent action in cases where the rules are not correctly applied .
the proposed decision authorises France to apply a reduced rate of excise duty on a significant quota of &apos; traditional &apos; rum produced in its overseas departments from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2012 .
it was misguided , however .
in the absence of the necessary information , in actual fact , one gains the impression that it is perhaps the absence of consensus among the members of the Council of Governors that prevents decision-making and that stops matters from developing .
I think that the proposal on the 2011 budget , which we will vote on tomorrow , maintains a perfect balance between budget saving and economic stimulation and satisfies the European Parliament priorities that have been raised repeatedly .
we are here to vote .
he asked about our level of knowledge and information about the social dialogue in all of the Member States right across the Union .
I have received a request from the Group of the Party of European Socialists to remove the sub-item on Iraq .
the debate is closed .
all of the components are now in place for a relaunch of US / European relations and the Commission will make major efforts to revitalise this partnership .
the first point is the question of decentralisation .
I must stress that we are not the guilty party here .
if they sign up to this , they have to follow through .
clearly , neighbourhood does not automatically entail membership , but it can result in membership .
in March 2003 the European Council identified a set of priorities for implementing the sustainable development strategy and the Johannesburg outcomes .
we are constantly confronted in the EU with the consequences of the financial crisis , which , in 2009 , overflowed into a budgetary crisis , a significant aspect of which was the excessive issuing of government bonds .
harmonisation is indeed necessary , but through progress and not by everyone dropping down to the same low level , as has been common practice where attempts have been made &apos; to achieve an internal market &apos; .
Europe needs a legal area in which its citizens feel at home and protected .
however , this does not mean that we agree with or applaud the whole content of the Green Paper .
I was responsible for the opinion on the radio spectrum policy programme in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , and I am very pleased with the text that has now been voted on .
I cite my own amendment as a bad example .
we therefore call on the competent committee to initiate its own report on this issue .
in view of the accidents which have occurred recently , does the Council intend to take any specific action to ensure that metallised insulating materials such as Mylar or Tedlar are replaced in passenger planes ?
I would therefore like these measures to give SMEs a new momentum and the Member States to strengthen training programmes for the workforce responsible for making buildings energy efficient .
I am sorry , on this last occasion , to have to differ .
on the prospects of the bilateral agreements of 1992 , we would like to inform you that , despite several good-faith attempts to solve the dispute amicably over the past years , the differences between the two sides - the US and the EU - have proven too big .
Mrs Wallis claims that the same principles are always applied by the European Parliament with regard to the waiver of the immunity of its Members .
the debate is closed .
does anybody wish to speak in favour of Mr Santini &apos;s motion ?
I have noticed that when ministers go back to their Member States , they claim all the credit for Europe &apos;s successes themselves and blame the Commission and the European Parliament for everything that goes wrong . This means that neither institution can do anything right .
regarding public services , a subject mentioned by a number of speakers , the last of whom was Mr Saint-Josse , I should like to say that the French Presidency is very attentive to this matter .
a characteristic of the proposals presented is that the various interests have not been registered , not even within the European Commission .
even those giving support to those people would , in the future , become guilty of terrorism .
patents are of very little or no use to inventors .
the Member States ’ policy on Israel and Palestine is , instead , a losing one .
we will now return to our usual business .
we have no interest in interfering with fair trading .
in many places things went much quicker than that , but in some Member States we have , however , been able to keep the groundwater clean and to avoid having the dubious permits sought by all those who , instead of clean water , talked of healthy water with an in-built allowance for what humans and animals can tolerate .
it was always Parliament &apos;s line that , with all restraint regarding closer cooperation , it should be possible to go over to that side as a last resort , to actually be able to carry out differentiated integration of this kind by means of a veto .
we need to concentrate increasingly on infrastructure and on job creation rather than on a growing consumption that relies on imports .
in the European Parliament ’ s proposal the main decrease in expenditure relates to sub-programme 1.a , ‘ Competitiveness for growth and employment ’ , and also to administrative expenditure by the EU institutions , channelling extra resources towards the European Parliament ’ s traditional priorities .
let us put more money in the budget , change the decision on programmes like SAVE and Altener .
it is tedious to go over the same ground again and again but , at the risk of seeming extremely boring , I would stress once again my position , which is based on one major assumption : we Members of Parliament and our institution have exactly the same dignity , as a branch of the Budgetary Authority , as the Council , and this means that we are by no means bound to bow to the decisions of the Council without making our mark .
this goes for projects concerning institutional , legal and administrative reform as well as assistance for private sector development , economic development , development of NGOs and civil society .
I would remind the Commission of the need to prioritise the financial resources for this purpose , especially because of the simple fact that electric vehicles have the additional benefit of having an excellent energy storage capacity , which the other options do not have and which is so necessary for our energy independence .
this was not so difficult to achieve . The Council adopted the EP &apos; s position at first reading .
that is why I consider it so very important for the OSCE and NATO to work together very closely .
so that is the problem we face .
if they wish to continue to trade in the single market , SMEs need to make the conversion very quickly so that their software can handle the euro .
the Kyoto Protocol is the main instrument in the global fight against climate change and a good example of the effectiveness of global cooperation .
I am sure that Swiss funds will be used sensibly for innovative purposes , including scientific research , providing support for small and medium-sized companies , as well as protecting the environment and fostering regional development .
however , no organ exchange network has yet been set up at the EU 27 level .
7 . Protocol to the EC-Tajikistan Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (
fourthly , and finally , I would like to invite you , on Wednesday at 12 : 00 , to hear a mid-term review of my Presidency of the Parliament .
 
changing the number of figures in the nomenclature from eight to six could lead to the elimination of an essential element .
as a member of the delegation to the EU-Moldova Parliamentary Cooperation Committee , I welcome every step that leads or may lead to a consolidation of the political situation in Moldova and to a better standard of living for its inhabitants .
I hope that at least you , Commissioner , are in favour of the call in both reports for progress to be made towards this objective in the next two years .
finally , on the question of recreational waters : I think that all the recreational water amendments are rather silly , because the definition is too wide to be meaningful .
nor do we want to give money to subsidise tobacco cultivation , as this contributes directly to public health problems .
the Commission must take action and support the affected parties .
indeed , there are actually studies showing that , in countries offering the opportunity of bringing environmental proceedings and reviewing the application of environmental law , environmental law has become much stricter : there is a direct link .
these were elements that Parliament claimed it was &apos; determined to defend &apos; , saying it was &apos; ready to start constructive negotiations with the Council ’ , in the Resolution of 18 January 2006 , which rejected the agreement of the December 2005 European Council .
yet , what the report does not tell us is that there are more and more of these human tragedies , ever since the destructive Schengen agreements abolishing internal border controls were signed in 1985 .
Muslim fundamentalists and fanatics have in fact been massacring part of the Sudanese population simply because it adheres to the Christian religion .
now , 59 years later , there is true healing , and Europe is free .
will the Commissioner therefore finally confirm his unequivocal support for this directive and his willingness to work with us in Parliament for its speedy and smooth transition ?
question No 42 by Mr Camisón Asensio ( H-0299 / 97 )
the arguments for and against went on for a further 18 years until at last the constitution was established and its opponents were finally quashed . And there were then already democratic elements in this constitution .
quite correctly , he notes that the majority of the EU &apos;s budget is administered in the Member States .
I commend the report to the House .
these documents call very directly for the first pillar to be reconsidered , and also call for an automatic increase in the legal retirement age based on life expectancy .
I sincerely hope we will agree to money for research into bee-keeping and honey production from the reserve which we have agreed .
let us not disappoint them .
paying salaries during a strike is a small matter .
Mr President , in reply to the last remarks by Mr Casaca , this does not correspond to the way in which we are doing these things .
likewise , historical accuracy requires us to recognise that , for the Serbs , Kosovo is their original homeland , just as Israel is for the Israelis .
( the sitting was closed at 7 p.m. )
thank you very much , Commissioner .
you have achieved the opportunity for detailed discussion of country-specific situations at every key decision-making stage of the policy cycle , including confirmation of Parliament &apos;s right to initiate dialogue with individual Member States .
in writing . - I voted for this proposal to transfer EUR 13 022 500 from the ESF to a budget line to give support to Ireland following the severe flooding it suffered in November 2009 .
I call on the Council to show responsibility for the basic right of freedom of religion , to swiftly draw up an implementable strategy to protect Christians throughout the world and to establish a separate unit for intercultural and religious matters in the European External Action Service .
Commissioner , we are talking about an economic sector that needs legal security and medium- and long-term guarantees that will enable a minimum degree of planning , and any further change or uncertainty could , at least in my country , have serious social and economic consequences .
the amounts I propose are : in Category 3 , EUR 400 million ; in Category 4 , EUR 990 million ; and in Category 5 , EUR 150 million .
11 . Environmental protection from radiation following the crash of a military aircraft in Greenland ( vote )
in this connection , I believe that the European Union should conduct an honest debate amongst its Member States to inform public opinion as to which governments are fully prepared to implement the United Nations resolutions and which are not .
these reports are a key factor in the implementation of the common fisheries policy .
since that point , the number of Member States using the opt-out has risen sharply .
Mrs McKenna , I already explained to you on Monday that this decision was taken by the Quaestors , who followed the recommendation of the services responsible .
Mr President , it was specifically Rule 140 of the European Parliament ’ s Rules of Procedure to which I intended to refer . This states that we are entitled to consult documents directly via Parliament ’ s internal computer system .
to those of you here in this assembly with doubts , I say : look at how your own countries have developed !
it is only a matter of four months .
as Greece has not yet provided the necessary justification to demonstrate that such excesses of PM10 are due to natural events , the Commission expects to receive plans and programmes in accordance with Article 8 of the framework directive by the end of 2003 .
let me briefly list the three things we need .
trust cannot be decreed or legislated for ; it depends to a large extent on the behaviour of the institutions .
is that so ?
to a large degree , globalisation has helped to create wealth , but – and this I say to Mr Hökmark – it has , equally , contributed to greater poverty , more exclusion , and to more social division , which does not , indeed , add up to equality and justice for all .
around two-thirds of the new jobs which it is estimated will be created between 2002 and 2010 will be filled by women , which is why I was especially pleased , Commissioner , with your communication a short while ago about the new initiatives which you have taken on behalf of the Commission to coordinate economic policy and employment policy .
I welcome the Commission &apos;s presentation of proposals for adapting this instrument and bringing it up to date .
fortunately , the Pollack report is short but forceful and not too demanding , unlike the Napoletano report .
today , books are in the main cheaper and , in what is known as the modern mega-store , every book is in stock anyway .
great efforts are being made in regional policy , whilst in information policy there are many opportunities .
thank you , Mr President-in-Office .
it is usual practice in Parliament ’ s temporary committees for ministers to give their points of view .
I wish to thank the budget rapporteur and the various group coordinators for their excellent levels of cooperation , although I did put forward some points of view that differ from the general approach .
whatever means the Ivorians choose to restore the rule of law , through the courts or through a truth and reconciliation commission , one thing is clear : there is no statute of limitation on war crimes .
one way of improving the situation is to pay reasonable wages to well-trained and qualified staff .
if you seek to make it dependent on the votes of that gentleman , whose three or four votes just might help the Commission get a majority , then you are weakening Europe .
I would like to move on behalf of the PPE-DE Group that we give ourselves an extra four weeks and postpone the vote until November , because Commissioner Tajani has stated that there will be a major hearing on the subject in November .
it is really quite amazing .
the budgetary authority will ultimately have to judge the right scale of European Union external aid programmes . However , my only aim is to put the Commission in a position where it can run these programmes competently .
among other things , he spoke of ‘ European perspectives ’ .
there are several measures which come about from Solvency II which I think have helped to make this one of the leading reports , which will be a global leader at that .
when I get the answer on paper I am going to go through it again and I will come back if I feel that the answer needs to be elaborated .
( DE ) My question concerns the common measures that could help us .
this week , President Putin announced amendments to the Russian constitution , effectively removing the elements of democracy from the country ’ s political system .
( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to begin by joining with the previous speakers in condemning in the harshest possible terms the coup d &apos;état staged against the government of President Zelaya in Honduras .
the situation is becoming so worrying that for example , in my country - the situation in other Member States not being any better - NGOs which do not have a reputation for following hardline or irresponsible policies have set off alarm bells denouncing the ridiculous bureaucratic demands made on displaced persons reporting incidents of torture or degrading treatment .
so what we want to hear today is that it is prepared to get moving on the basis of our proposals , which are supported by all beekeepers in the Community , from north to south , and we mean in the right direction .
you , ladies and gentlemen , by voting in favour of my report , and more importantly you , Commissioner , and the Commission , by implementing the ideas contained in it can make a fundamental contribution to this development .
after all , it is our job as Members of the European Parliament to listen , to engage in dialogue with representatives of consumers and producers , employers and employees , environmental and public interest groups .
individual Member States have responded very well .
as the report shows , China is already an important economic and political partner for Africa .
let us also be entirely open .
in addition to this , the European common security and defence policy and the European development cooperation policy are two sides of the same coin .
the Internet is , above all , an essential tool for exercising fundamental freedoms and for the public to enjoy genuine democracy .
.
this implies a major shift in the focus of research and an increase in sustainable funding for the vaccine package .
( FR ) Mr President , one second more to thank you , Mr Coelho , and tell you that it is a great pleasure to work with you as you always show great skill , you have a true capacity for listening and analysis and it is due to you that we have achieved this result .
this reality is that there are important limitations to vaccination and there is still no widespread support for such a policy .
that is the first way in which the blind can tell what they have in their hands .
we will never let the atrocities of terrorism defeat the values of peace and democracy in Europe .
there is , moreover , a clear link between the level of taxes and deductions , and the extent as well as the growth of the black economy .
there were discussions about increased solidarity among the Member States and ensuring the sustainability of the social security and pension systems .
but it is an uncontroversial fact that this has meant that summertime in the Union has changed quite considerably .
if public monopolies are turned into private oligopolies , we will have achieved little .
it is well-known that the service of the above documents is a serious issue , with a significant impact on both the process of justice and civil and commercial relations .
for one thing , a tripartite body , the EARI ( European Association for Railway Interoperability ) , has been set up and has undertaken the work of identifying and specifying existing technologies , components and procedures , which should culminate in two TSIs in the near future .
we ask the Commission and the Council to make this view clear to President Berisha in unmistakable terms .
on every side of this House , I will make a bet with you that , month after month , year after year , report after report , we will have to suffer the long litany of regrets at having an insufficient budget , but it will be too late .
unfortunately , I cannot give you any more details on this at the moment .
we are now witnessing the same phenomenon with predictions for movement of labour from the accession countries .
this factor contributes to the problems of fish stocks in the Baltic .
it is , moreover , clear that there are differing positions within the European Union on the subject and , in particular , on the stance to be taken in the face of repeated requests from the Chinese .
the vote will take place this afternoon following the debates .
the debate is closed .
I thank you for this debate and I am sure we shall continue it at a later date .
the 19th century British politician Benjamin Disraeli once said : &apos; No government can be long secure without a formidable opposition &apos; .
nonetheless , we have made available ECU 200 000 through ECHO .
in writing . - Mr Leichtfried should be commended for a thorough and conclusive report , which had dealt effectively with many of the issues left open by the Commission paper .
Mr President , in December , Commission President Barroso told me by letter that his meeting with President Nazarbayev last October would help advance respect for human rights in Kazakhstan .
we have never tried to put a positive spin on his activities or his aims , and we only hope that the Turkish Government will ensure that his trial is open and fair , although we do not feel exactly optimistic about this .
I assure you that the Commission will examine these conclusions with great care when analysing areas where it can see policy gaps and when setting out priorities for the coming years .
we have already learned a great deal during the four previous budget procedures .
we hope that imbalance will be redressed .
thirdly , this directive , as it currently stands in the common position , guarantees - in particular because it confines itself exclusively to minimum standards - a high degree of flexibility and modest regulation by the European Union ; by adopting it we contribute to the Member States &apos; bearing a high level of individual responsibility .
I believe that we have a duty to stress the equivalence between European citizens and asylum seekers , because asylum is not something granted by Member States to people who are fleeing from wars , asylum is a duty of Member States and it is the right of those people to be able to stay in our countries with all the rights that European citizens enjoy .
if we continue like this , there will be nothing which is not regulated .
the United States is not moving very quickly to implement these decisions .
I wonder to what degree this will help territorial cohesion , knowing the peculiarities of the Greek state .
we have always followed employment processes in the Member States and offered constructive criticism .
at our first reading in Strasbourg last October , Parliament voted amendments which I felt would improve the quality of the text , and I announced some of the irregularities and flaws to which I alluded a moment ago .
we believe that the European Parliament , the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions should play a more active role in helping to implement and monitor the strategy .
irrespective of the fact that the Commission has a tradition of a certain prudence in its initiatives , we believe that , particularly in this field , it would be rather silly to start from the assumption that there is nothing that needs changing , although none of us sees uncontrolled liberalisation as an option .
you then had something to say about money and economic cooperation .
we must remember , as Europe integrates more closely , that it is very important that we seek to protect and promote our different cultural and linguistic diversities within the EU itself .
one of the outstanding issues is setting the rights of ethnic and religious minorities - Kurds , Christians , Alevists and others .
I would call on all my fellow Members to share this dream with me and I hope that we will all wake up one day soon to a free Cuba in control of its own destiny .
thank you .
the EU and the US are the world &apos;s most integrated economies ; we are each other &apos;s largest trade and investment partners ; we share common values and responsibilities for tackling global challenges on a variety of issues , be it innovation or environmental challenges , energy security or access to raw materials .
the Dutch Party for Freedom ( PVV ) is voting against this recommendation of the European Parliament .
human Rights Watch does not think so .
if they were to exist , I would want that fact to come out .
there must be a well-managed status settlement , and I am confident that , once we have that , there will be no destabilising effects on ethnically mixed areas such as Vojvodina .
Mr President , first I would like to thank the rapporteur , Massimo Carraro , for an excellent report .
the Council has been left in no doubt as to the strength of feeling in this House about the internment without due process of Guantanamo Bay prisoners .
I also welcome the willingness of the Israelis to meet with the Quartet envoys tomorrow , but I urge Israel to make positive moves now to find a solution and to promote and support moves towards direct talks .
we are told in the report that the aim is &apos; the possible construction of safe , clean and economically competitive prototype reactors &apos; .
corrections to votes and voting intentions : see Minutes
I also want to remind you that you organized a hearing on the Chiapas question here in Parliament , with the participation of civil society , NGOs and also the Mexican government , and that deserves thanks .
having said that - and here I combine several questions which have been raised - some aspects must be looked into in more depth .
Europe &apos;s main problem today is unemployment : 20 million citizens are looking for work . This is not inevitable , as we see the United States announcing at the same time that less than 5 % of its citizens are unemployed .
for that reason I am very content with this report and this initiative by the European Parliament to promote learning among older people as well .
of course , there are also a few delicate matters .
I would also like to express my appreciation of the fact that it has been possible to draw up an 18-month programme as part of a cooperation process together with France , which previously held the Presidency of the European Union , and Sweden , which will take over the EU Presidency in the second half of this year .
Madam President , Mr Vice-President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , the Group of the European People ’ s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats wishes to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Grosch , on his excellent report on the Commission ’ s proposal for a third Directive on driving licences .
I hope that the ratification process will be speeded up by the vote of approval given today in the European Parliament .
I doubt as yet whether the report by the Kok committee for economic growth can make a difference .
it also has the highest social standards and respects workers at work .
( LT ) Mr President , Commissioner , thank you for your really comprehensive response .
his proposals for achieving this are as old as they are misguided : he calls for expenditure to be capped ( naturally with social transfer benefits as the main source of savings ) instead of calling for improvements on the income side and he calls for wage restraint at a time when wages are generally falling in real terms and transnational groups are making a killing and often do not even have to pay any tax .
we then go on to deal with NGOs ; we try to support the population by other means .
that is why we consider it important to review this support immediately so as to ensure greater fairness in support for potato production and to assist the majority of potato producers , that is to say small producers and family farms .
so please come in Bali with high ambitions and try to help us as you know how to do .
I say coherence because the key objective of our political policies in future years will be to encourage sustainable development .
this is ensuring that this institutional reform work is carried out with a much higher degree of participation by the European Parliament than the previous revision of the Treaty . This augurs well for the success of our work .
it was taken after a thorough consideration of all the consequences and furthermore , placing it in the broader context of the European Union , which is the fact that most of the EU &apos;s Member States are also members of NATO .
– Mr President , we often talk about people washing their hands of the matter .
a second aim was achieved , and Mr Spencer , the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , has expressly authorized me to say so on his behalf also .
first of all , Commissioner , do some investigation and tell us the names of those British companies which manufactured these feeds in the 1980s .
society is intimidated and is effectively being held hostage by criminals .
in the communication published this month on the implementation of the nanotechnology action plan , we fully address the second part of your question .
I would like to speak on two topics : climate change , and research and development .
the directive on which the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs reports is therefore an important addition to supervision in this important service industry .
but today I arrived in Parliament , I opened my window in the office in the Tower and I could not hear Strasbourg airport , I could not even hear the railway .
I think this quest for mobility , knowledge , respect and acceptance should also be developed in the area of arts and culture .
French farmers will not only have to pay for enlargement in the long term ; they are also already paying to set up the single currency .
 
the citizens &apos; initiative is a major innovation of the Treaty of Lisbon .
I query whether the only way of dealing with these two views is to deplore them .
of course the European Union must continue to help Albania .
Iraq , its neighbours and the other states in the region are called upon to play a key role by strengthening good neighbourly relations and by cooperating to improve regional security .
I voted in favour of this report and of the amendment calling for a review of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) .
secondly , compliance without retractions with all the obligations which derive from the Ankara protocol , which Turkey has signed .
forget about agreeing on the details !
we should therefore not be tempted only to focus on our minor or major disappointments , but rather look at the whole picture and , with a sense of balance , point at the increased opportunities for transparency and at the Union &apos;s decisive policy .
the Council must be aware , however , that it too needs to represent the citizens of Europe .
Mr President , Romania has made exceptional progress in recent months .
I object to the fact that while the Commission treats the European wine industry leaders with kid gloves , countries like the Czech Republic are treated in a strict and even harsh manner .
I believe that we all too often talk above people &apos; s heads and at a far remove from their everyday lives .
the view of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party is still that the weapons inspectors must be allowed to continue with their work for as long as their efforts are meaningful and for as long as they are making progress .
to react to this with even more red-tape is the worst response imaginable .
I concur with the position of the report &apos;s author , indicating that the recent humanitarian disasters in Haiti and Pakistan have demonstrated once again the need to improve the EU &apos;s disaster-response capability in terms of effectiveness , speed of response , coordination and visibility .
ownership is therefore at the very heart of this new relationship that we want to establish with our African friends .
it is a binding commitment under the Treaty , and one that is taken into account quite explicitly in many policy areas .
fortunately , the Slovakian Government is in the process of recruiting additional officials , which , in itself , is a considerable step forward .
– In Europe , law and order is based on a system of universal values that is enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and in the emerging Constitution .
but you have to start by respecting the procedures that are agreed already , that are known and that are laid down in writing .
we need a consolidated version of the Treaty before we ask our citizens to make an informed choice .
Mrs Schroedter , rest assured that I am keeping a very close eye on ensuring that the Structural Funds are implemented as per the regulation and in accordance with European directives on the environment .
the Commission has completed the processing of the Greek request concerning the application of the n + 2 rule and reached the conclusion that what is left as the potential cut due to the n + 2 rule is EUR 8 638 000 , which is less than what was initially on the table .
today is , hopefully , the beginning of the end of a process .
I am very much in sympathy with your suggestions .
– Mr President , I should like to point out , on behalf of the Socialist Group and my colleague , Mrs Valenciano Martínez-Orozco , that we believe there may be an error on the voting list concerning Amendment 15 , tabled by the PPE-DE Group .
it gave the Member States the opportunity to set criteria on the basis of which funds would be distributed , channelling them , above all , to those producers who needed them most .
we need to face the facts , that this is a country with high levels of crime which the government cannot control .
I have heard some people raise concerns about this . Mr Giansily , my friend Mr Giansily , in particular .
in addition , the importance of what the Member States have to do in implementing and enforcing the Batteries Directive should not be underestimated .
I only say this : we are having to use the Annex III procedure for a very basic reason which I am sure will be understood .
the negotiations on the EU budget may well pose the threat of some sort of linkage between the constitution and the financial framework .
it is a pity that the United States has felt unable to take part in the agreement .
tools are in place : association agreements , a neighbourhood policy and in particular the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly , which is a great democratic step forward in this process .
the structure has already been referred to , and that also includes European structures .
this evidence states that fishing on the high seas by the European Union fleet provides work for 40 650 workers and that the catches total 2.7 million tonnes per year .
Portugal is one of the biggest textile and clothing producers in the Union .
the Barents Euro-Arctic Council must be given an equal position with the Council of Baltic States .
firstly , we need to make the EU &apos; s development policy more effective .
we need to take steps to prevent similar terrorist attacks again taking place in or from the air .
the government must step up the anti-inflationist bias of the economic policy instruments available to it , particularly in the fields of the budget and income policy .
it does not stop there , however .
the Danish Social Democrats agree that it must be possible to make emergency calls from public pay-phones free of charge , but taking account of the prospect of disproportionately high costs , we are not in favour of the idea that there should be pay-phones for the transmission of written texts to the same , or to a similar , extent as there are ordinary publicly accessible pay-phones .
I think that we should draw a distinction between people who help others for financial gain and others who really do this out of non-commercial motives .
we are making very gradual progress but at the same time we are seeing a proliferation of individual State initiatives , which disturb the balance of the legislative programme . We are also seeing bilateral or multilateral initiatives and agreements which will lead us goodness knows where , in relation , for example , to the issue of Schengen in the Treaty .
I appreciated the relative optimism of your opening words , Commissioner , but I think that things which go without saying are better said and I would like to help strengthen the grounds for optimism .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to start by saying that it would have been good if , when he was here in plenary , Mr Klaus had expressed his opinion on the accusations that are already well known .
if cultural diversity means to strengthen each specific characteristic within another specific characteristic , we will not gain anything in terms of diversity , in the way that we want to here in Europe .
that is how peoples obtain the right to amendment ...
we must present a united front against violence , fascism and communism .
there is only one way this ridiculous currency spanning many different economies against a whole background of failed ideals can survive - and if you understood international money to any degree , you would understand this - and that is by having a financial , central , statist fiscal policy .
Turkey is actively involved in international measures to prevent the channelling of heroin from Afghanistan into the European Union .
( applause )
these people have a disadvantage and are entitled to our support and should get a special tariff for the service .
we also have a high incidence of other conditions such as diabetes where advances in insulin production , as a direct result of biotechnological research , have been of enormous benefit .
children themselves are asking to be consulted and want their opinions and perspectives , their hopes and dreams to form part of efforts to build a world suited to them .
twelve friendly solutions were proposed , 36 cases resulted in critical remarks , including one to Parliament for failing to take adequate measures to promote fundamental compliance with smoking rules on its premises , 17 draft recommendations were prepared and one special report was submitted .
I hope that the Commission and Parliament will remain resolute in facing up to the Council , which is taking a rather softer line here .
please be a little more patient !
there is some support amongst stakeholders for a European Private Company .
the purpose of such an examination must be to ensure that the indicators reflect the core objectives of the revised guidelines .
that is a situation which simply cannot be tolerated .
I agree with those who say that it is the prerequisite of successful negotiations to have a common EU position .
my question is simple .
Mr President , the revitalization of the railways is of crucial importance to the sustainable society in Europe .
we all agree here that we need these limit values and that there is no such thing as completely &apos; GM-free &apos; .
half of the governments accused of failing to apply EU law have not replied to Mr Monti &apos;s letters six months after they were despatched .
after
I am thinking in particular of livestock breeding .
in 1980 , there were still 310 cutters that fished for cod under the Dutch flag , while these days most fishermen have switched to flatfish , and there are only a handful of cutters left that fish for cod .
as I said before , we must ensure that the quality of adult education is further improved .
there must be a specific mechanism providing incentives and certain tax incentives to create jobs for young people and the elderly .
of course it is also the case that the resources for rural development are insufficient .
during the period from 14 June to 14 October 2010 , 1 336 redundancies were made , while another 1 498 redundancies were made prior to and after the period in question .
an agreement has been reached concerning banana imports into the EU which will no longer put the Latin American supplier countries at a disadvantage when compared with the African , Caribbean and Pacific ( ACP ) Group of States .
question No 45 by ( H-0008 / 02 ) :
there is no doubt that within the agricultural sector we have made good progress in connection with controlling the funds .
we therefore have to engage with the country in a constructive , continuous and strategic manner .
Member States take it upon themselves to refuse the right of residence to foreign students , even if they are enrolled at a recognised educational establishment , if they believe that they have changed direction or are not progressing quickly enough , which should be a decision left to the university authorities .
I should add straight away , however , that they strike me as ambitious .
could the Commission please give me a clear &apos; yes &apos; or &apos; no &apos; answer ?
these issues do not prevent the creation of a common conception and a common agenda on issues of democracy , international cooperation and a just and viable world order such as we envisage in the European Parliament and the European Union .
while the language of the resolution is weaker than I would have wished , nevertheless a resolution carried by an overwhelming vote of the parliament is more likely to influence the decisions of Israel and Hamas than individual Political Group resolutions .
being someone ’ s guest does not give you the right to interfere in their business .
it is a territory vulnerable to spill-over from these conflict areas and to infiltration by Islamic militants .
on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteurs and other shadows for the hard work they have put into producing these reports .
I was struck by one aspect , namely that where Europe is able to act in a united fashion - as Mrs Maij-Weggen said in her speech - the United States is ready to listen to us and to follow us .
I want to use the seconds remaining to me just to ask the Commission for something .
we are indebted , too , to the German Presidency and to the German Federal Minister for Transport , Mr Tiefensee , who invested considerable personal effort : he participated in a number of conciliation meetings and I believe that without his determination to succeed we should not have this Railway Package before us today .
firstly , the interests of Cyprus must not be violated simply because of the presence of Turkey , a large country .
we look at ways we can develop incentives for research , including the use of virtual institutes for health to stimulate and organise health and biotechnology research and development .
the position of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party has been extremely clear from the start .
I recall , in particular , the important role played by the EU &apos;s &apos; Television without Frontiers &apos; Directive which , since 1989 , has made sure that citizens in all EU Member States are free to receive , without restrictions , broadcasts from other EU countries ; an EU directive which has substantially contributed to the free flow of information across borders and to a more pluralistic media landscape in all Member States .
in the past , it has looked a little too much like a self-service shop .
something that I think is actually far more important in estimating the market situation is the fact that South Korean manufacturers have recently opened major factories in Europe , namely in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia , which will be capable of producing around half a million cars between them on an annual basis , so the reality is perhaps that , in future , Korean cars produced in Europe will largely , in effect , be the cars that reach the market here .
pedestrians account for 65 % of deaths and 35 % of pedestrian deaths are children .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank the rapporteur .
this results in overexploitation .
the economic crisis is certainly hampering negotiations ; however , tough negotiations on the back of people living in absolute poverty are , at best , morally questionable .
there is coordination at EU level of aspects of the pension systems relating to the operation of the internal market , such as compliance with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact and the EU 2020 Strategy .
? because all they have succeeded in doing is preventing the words &apos; in this context &apos; from being inserted , as we are going to vote on all the other parts .
Mr President , bearing in mind the severity with which breaches of the Highway Code are cracked down on , it is hard to understand the laxity from which those who pollute our marine environment and view the sea as a dustbin at present benefit , especially since most pollution by hydrocarbons stems from deliberate discharges rather than accidents .
in this respect , instead of thinking about other institutions , the question that Parliament needs to ask itself is what contribution it can make to a change of institutional and political attitude in this House .
( HU ) Commissioner , it is very important that the Council of Europe has a mechanism that was developed and has been functioning for decades , monitored by the European Court of Human Rights , and that the European Union will share it .
I voted unequivocally for the document submitted .
it is essential to compare the report submitted by the European Association of Gelatine Manufacturers , on which the Commission based its proposal for the partial lifting of the ban , with independent scientific opinions .
no agreement was reached .
the regulations that we are going to adopt reinforce the outcomes of the Madrid agreement and , in some cases , go further , for which I would like to thank Mr Rapkay , Mrs Gräßle and Mr Rivellini .
the issue of consultations and worker participation has been much discussed here - and not only today .
so to start the process of the Commission &apos;s recuperation , may we insist that the outgoing Members of the Santer Commission apply voluntarily the Prodi Code of Conduct .
we need to start formulating a policy and strategy that focus on the local level and the reality of manufacturing on the ground , and I would like to stress here the need for attention to be paid to the manufacturing situation in Padania .
the positive fact about the committee is that not only does it give citizens the opportunity to have their say ; it also ensures they are heard - which is possibly more important .
we are now recognising the importance of tackling smaller particulates , which are so damaging to people &apos;s health , and have avoided increasing implementation periods .
the report calls for sanctions to be applied to countries that do not comply with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 .
one absolute principle in all modern codes of criminal law is that of , according to which criminal penalties may only be applied to something that was punishable as a crime at the time the deed was done .
I want to put on record that I am not against women &apos;s rights .

accordingly , the policy of information on breast screening must be improved and stepped up , programmes to detect cancer at an early stage must be put in place and support for research into preventing breast cancer must be strengthened .
in order to achieve this , the Commission will be holding bilateral meetings with Member States , followed by a discussion seminar with youth leaders .
although all development programmes in Sierra Leone have been de facto suspended , it is also agreed that upon their resumption , programmes related to rehabilitation and reconstruction would be adapted to take into account the more urgent needs resulting from the crisis , such as housing reconstruction programmes .
it has produced a single market on paper , but not yet a single market in reality .
this , in my opinion , was a positive feature and , in fact , I would also have preferred us to have retained it .
firstly , the danger we have just mentioned : the exclusion of those who cannot go as fast as the others .
as all the Members know , I am quite flexible with speaking time , and so I would ask you to start the debate because we have already lost one and a half minutes with this interruption .
it is my belief that the Conference of Presidents clearly indicated a will to seize the political opportunity , to have a politicians &apos; debate at the earliest available moment after Barcelona .
moreover , the Commission in no way draws the obvious conclusions from the problems that have already arisen as a result of the EIA project .
we must find the courage to face up to the future .
the Third Pan-European Conference will , as Mr Lüttge correctly pointed out , provide representatives from the European transport industry with a particular opportunity to put forward not only their ideas in a variety of areas but also their products because they will have the opportunity to exhibit them .
some governments make a show of virtue in contrast to the large states that are deemed to be guilty .
the signatories are none other than Mr Daul and Mr Schulz , who should definitely try to become known and recognised in Germany , rather than in France .
I believe we have to seek unity and not offend our fellow Members because we have to work together to find a way to move ahead .
a common definition must urgently be sought , so that the European citizens realize that this produces added value outside the Union as well .
the Commission will consider further funding decisions when new needs emerge or when access to groups requiring help , and who are currently out of reach , becomes possible .
the impression is always given that the Union rests upon the will of a single country ; holding the Presidency of the Union means that one country is responsible for coordinating the activities of the Union , not for carrying out all the Union &apos;s duties , because that is done by the Union itself .
above all , we must strive to ensure that all decommissioning work is carried out in time while properly implementing all the necessary safety measures and eliminating even minimal risks to human health and the environment .
the initiative for a global response to a global crisis came from Europe .
various studies are being conducted in this field and must , of course , receive appropriate support from the European Union , in particular financial support , in order to fulfil the obligations established at the Johannesburg Summit in 2002 : political coherence , sustainable management of natural resources and promoting methods of consumption ...
my fellow Member , Mrs in &apos; t Veld , is right to say that this unfailing support must include the renewal of that promise of membership once the democratisation process has been completed ; it is absolutely crucial to say this .
we also protest against that .
by creating this legislation , will we not soon find ourselves in a ridiculous position , bordering on the laughable ?
the Tunisian Government is said to have created obstacles and obstructed freedom to come and go and to attend a meeting - not an institutional meeting - in Brussels .
it may also apply to third-country nationals and especially to relatives who are third-country nationals and who are not allowed to accompany the breadwinner when he or she obtains work on the other side of the border .
Mr President , Madam Commissioner , a series of recent financial collapses , which have had serious consequences for investors , have brought to the fore the question of liability in financial accounts as well as the role played by the auditor .
this is the same period as holders of residence permits are allowed and , at the same time , it also ties the Member States to their obligation to provide residence permits in cases where stays of more than one year are authorised .
by letter of 27 April 1995 the Commission had to draw the attention of the minister to certain conditions of the call for tender which could appear to be discriminatory .
as far as the question is concerned , I support the concerns and the incentives proposed by Mrs Theato .
I think that is good news for all consumers .
the Council regrets that the parliamentary assembly of the OSCE and the ODIHR did not participate in the observation of the local elections in Albania .
this has been the practice so far and there is no reason to alter it .
finally , let me reassure my Spanish colleagues that the people of Almadén will have my full support for their just demands , which , in my view , can be achieved fully through the compromise package and not in opposition to it .
I also agree that measures must be tailored to different types of fishery .
yet another text seeking to lower the standards of public authorities for the benefit of entrepreneurs .
we must take decisive measures to counteract age discrimination , because the young people of Europe represent our future .
I strongly object to anyone trying to demonise a nation .
partly with the help of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds , the countries covered by cohesion policy have experienced economic growth at a rate higher than the Community average .
we believe in free but fair international trade which is based on sharing rules which are the same for everyone .
as you will remember , on 7 July , at our last sitting before the holidays , we were taken by surprise by the terrorist attacks on London , which , as we feared at the time , caused many victims .
in writing . - ( FI ) When I , like the majority in my group , voted against the mandatory 20 % energy savings target , I was not taking a stand on the importance of energy saving , but the way in which it is trying to be promoted .
as for the economic strategy , it is all very well for some to say that we need more constraints .
according to the proposed joint action , the Commission should report annually to the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers on how the rules on temporary asylum are being implemented in the Member States as well as the financial effects .
as to the shape of individual national military contributions , these will be discussed at the pledging conference to be held in the autumn under the French presidency .
they are willing to hear the best practice models that we can encourage for them .
nevertheless , our intentions are clear .
particularly during the forthcoming Review Conference , it should muster the necessary ambition and commit itself to the Treaty ’ s complete implementation .
that is quite right .
those who , in this area , adopt a defensive and protectionist position do not recognise the strengths and competitive advantages that the European Union possesses .
these are the proposals directed to the establishment of the European Asylum Support Office and the amendment of the Eurodac Regulation .
I already said that it is not very attractive , it makes the whole trial procedure more difficult and after all we have learned from the American experience .
the previous speaker , Mr Castagnetti , said something about that .
we deplore the fact that we are absent from the High Level Group .
this is the price to be paid for health .
however , I would like to comment on a couple of issues .
it would be very untidy of us as a parliament to vote on a contradictory text in light of this most recent information .
our proposal will also eliminate the restrictions of the current Regulation .
I wonder if they would all be prepared to set an example by cutting back the budgets for their large-scale farmers .
firstly , to understand that , even if the sustainability of public finances is a key element , it is not enough .
the regulations on GMOs ought to be a major advance in terms of bio-security , freedom of choice and freedom of information for consumers .
it is a package in which ECU 150 million can be spent and ECU 200 million actually saved .
that is true of every problem , including this one .
the confidential information concerned belongs to the citizen , not to the European Union , the Parliament or indeed the nation state .
the Commission proposes abolishing the double subsidy regulation and likewise retaining only one subsidy for the actual production .
subject : Uneven environment for growth and development in Member States
in listing these elements , I am treading upon the ground that is , to a substantial extent , common to all of us .
the accession of Austria to the Community was a joint venture .
it is a combination of very obvious advantages , which cannot be halted by calling perhaps for further measures because here , it really is the case that the best is the enemy of the good .
currently it is the Research Directorate-General that is responsible , and the result is that it is becoming difficult for the scientific community to communicate the concerns and needs of the sector to those that draw up the guidelines for the calls for proposals .
the areas that present the greatest difficulties to individuals and groups of citizens continue to be social protection , healthcare , taxation and recognition of academic qualifications , particularly for citizens who work in states other than their own Member States , such as in border regions .
by 20 January it was being translated .
we have to build Srebrenica into our common historical memory and into the foundations of the European Union &apos;s enlargement into the Western Balkans .
I have to admit that I myself am in favour of the proposals of the so-called independent Kosovo Committee of more than two years ago , in which a case was made for conditional independence .
what will you do now to get full political and legal accountability for European collusion in human rights abuses in the name of the so-called war on terror ?
I think that the Commissioner was right to say that we must aim to develop cooperation between the actors in the area so as to oblige North Korea to respect international rules , although I doubt this will happen with the current regime still in power .
however , we cannot yet be certain .
following the industrial era we are entering a conceptual era where values , meaning and empathy will come to the fore .
report ( A5-0081 / 2003 ) by Elmar Brok on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy on the conclusions of the negotiations on enlargement in Copenhagen ( 2003 / 2014 ( INI ) )
Commissioner , I think that we have found a number of arguments for the Convention to limit competition policy , but I do hope that when the Commission applies this regulation it will be able to show that , even without amending the Treaty , it is able to reach a balance between employment objectives and competition objectives .
in such circumstances , indeed , why should we hold back ?
Τhe next item is Question Time ( B7-0207 / 2010 / rev. 1 ) .
companies will then know a long time in advance what they are going to be faced with .
the Commission has already made attempts to do this , which I feel still need to be stepped up considerably and freed of red tape .
Mr President , I still remember the 1980s very well , when Latin America , including Paraguay of course , attracted enormous attention in Europe , because at that time a great many people , and above all young people , were interested in restoring democracy to Latin America .
as to the issue of revising the agreement on intellectual property , which you consider to be necessary , I do not think that a thorough revision would be appropriate .
we will continue the negotiations and at the beginning of July , we will take a final vote on the report after negotiation .
can the President-in-Office comment on whether the Council will deliberate whether we can have our meetings solely in Brussels and not have to come to Strasbourg ?
the Water Framework Directive lays down quality and quantity targets for all Community waters , including groundwater , and specifies the means whereby they are to be achieved .
in this way , we should also be showing , especially to today &apos; s young people , that we believe in an EU that is able to change in order to live up to its own ideals .
it is true that , if it were not for the fact that multilingualism is a necessity , in a few years time , we , the French MEPs in the European Parliament , would be calling for the right of our minority to speak our regional language .
in terms of languages , Europe has known times when a single language predominated : Latin , and also French .
we argued hard , but our arguments were always full of content and we related well as people .
there may be 50 nutcases in the chamber but there are 700 Members who oppose them , so do not inflate the fact that 50 lame-brains disrupted the signing ceremony into an affair of state .
- Before the vote
I say this because later in the year we will discuss the Commission ’ s proposal regarding a European fund for supplementing , but not replacing , national policies on integration .
 
we are now presented with an opportunity to allocate additional payments to cherries and sweet cherries , and also to soft fruit such as raspberries , strawberries , blackcurrants and gooseberries .
we have voted against Mr Castagnetti &apos;s report today on the promotion of European pathways in work-linked training , including apprenticeship .
I believe that this is a number that we should keep reminding people about , because the public often imagine that far more people are involved .
the Union &apos;s trade policy is geared towards greater opening up of all aspects of the international markets .
( ET ) Colleagues , Belarus is a blot on the map of Europe .
in daring even to say that , what Mr Barroso does is to expose the European project .
ethylhydroxyethylcellulose has , however , been used for more than 20 years in Sweden and Finland , and I think also in Norway , as a binding agent in gluten-free bread and pastries .
those who would not benefit are consumers .
they do not want the Socialist regulation-based model but a model based on being open , laying the ground for a level playing field and a social Europe , meaning jobs , growth , opportunities and cross-border integration .
I am pleased that the Committee on Culture has accepted these .
declaring its duty of Community solidarity in responding to the needs of these outermost regions , between 1989 and 1991 the European Community adopted some other action programmes due to their remote and island nature , called the POSEIs .
however , we should not overlook the fact that the order to adapt is ongoing .
because the contract had been signed by the previous Conservative Government , Mr Cook claimed it could not be broken .
high rates of unemployment and the falling demand for labour are fixed variables preventing our Union &apos;s social policies from coming into line .
( PL ) Mr President , I am shocked by the latest session of the diplomatic heads of the Member States , where the majority of foreign ministers asked for a European Union mandate to negotiate a new agreement between the EU and Russia before Russia lifts the trade restrictions it is imposing on Poland in the form of an embargo on Polish meat and agricultural produce .
fellow members , a toy is not just a market product , and regarding it from the aspect of safety and price alone is not good enough .
at the same time , action to encourage more women to apply to participate in applications has been unsuccessful .
we also believe it important - and this is also in line with my report - that the Berlin conclusions clearly state that Europe must pay more attention to European food quality , safety , environmental protection , animal welfare , and the rest .
amendment No 1 is not supported as in our opinion it brings little added value .
our current budgetary procedure is , however , somewhat different already .
I will keep you well informed about further developments in that programme .
nevertheless , I believe in the efficiency of the Aviation Safety Agency and in its position enough to be prepared to undertake another study with a view to assessing these conclusions and perhaps negating them .
allow me to refer to two examples to illustrate such follow-up . Firstly , further to the Ombudsman &apos; s initiative , the Commission agreed to make the scripts of candidates in competitive examinations available to them as of 1 July 2000 .
that concludes the votes .
indeed , the European Parliament is not a parliament which enjoys limitless sovereignty .
this Parliament &apos;s Committee on Women &apos;s Rights and Equal Opportunities has been working very intensively on all these issues .
they caused large-scale abandonment of the sector , especially in some regions such as my own , Galicia , and another of their consequences was that there were huge reductions in the strategic reserves of milk , which is a basic necessity .
the completion of the Single European Market is a goal of this Parliament , but too often protection of sacred cows , which many groups in this Parliament defend , have put obstacles in the road towards the completion of the single market .
I would therefore urge all MEPs to vote in favour of this report , which following lengthy debates , amendments and discussions represents an accurate reflection of the position of the European Parliament as regards human rights .
as for the Charter of Fundamental Rights , it is important that it is able not only to extend the rights that are already laid down in Charters and Treaties but also that it recognises rights in the social and economic spheres and , above all , that it is able to be innovative and creative in the area of new rights concerning environmental issues and the protection of consumer rights .
developing the non-food crops sector is very likely to have a positive impact on farmers that undergo the consequences of the sugar CMO reform .
the World Trade Organisation is a European idea , one to which the Americans were converted in Marrakech , after having opposed it for a long time .
the third point was well put by Mr Secchi in his report on the internal market .
I give the floor to Mr Bangemann to answer Mr Watts &apos;s question .
in fact , it is only by supporting all the initiatives being taken by the Organisation for African Unity , calling on the leaders to find a peaceful solution to the conflict , that we shall reach a settlement .
moreover , it is completely insane and contrary to every parliamentary tradition that Parliament &apos; s Committee on Budgetary Control , the ombudsman and the EU &apos; s own Court of Auditors are never in a position to check all the documents concerning the Commission &apos; s discharge of its office .
the introduction of these new technologies is not a threat , but a new opportunity for our tourism because it offers the potential to provide new and innovative tourism products and services , which our tourism needs for an ever-lengthening tourism season , so that it can attract new customers and offer new and alternative forms of tourism .
I am also grateful to Parliament for its support for our efforts to discover the best way of achieving energy efficiency and reducing CO2 emissions through intelligent technologies and for guiding us on the possible measures that could be taken .
our group stands alongside the Commission , whom I encourage to stick to their stability policy and pursue it consistently , and we would welcome it if the Finance Ministers were to take that on board .
thirdly , when they do so , the core concern is to combat the social exclusion of people , for that is the only way to effectively reduce long-term unemployment and poverty , and , in so doing , particular attention needs to be given to groups who , by reason of their personal characteristics , are especially subject to discrimination in trying to get into the labour market , such as , for example , people with disabilities and migrant women .
are we supporting them , or are we supporting the dictatorship which , for the time being , rules over them ?
in this way , we pay due regard to the principle of subsidiarity .
secondly , where a Court confirms these people ’ s guilt but changes their sentence , I believe that there has to be consideration of the idea , by both the Council as well as the Commission , of prisoner exchange , as long as the prisoners within the Member States of the European Union are willing , are ready , to serve their prison sentence in Libya .
the terms in which the motion for a resolution was tabled for discussion are offensive to most Spanish people and in particular to the victims of terrorism in Spain .
finally , I would like to know whether the Conference of Presidents is willing to consider widening the list of guest speakers and making it more representative by including women and non-religious organisations .
this means that we have to expect some difficulties and delays .
this is a great step , but it is only one step .
Madam President , unfortunately , the situation in Chechnya really has not improved , despite the efforts to persuade Russia to adopt a rational course .
could the Council please state clearly its position on the importance of tobacco-growing jobs in Mediterranean areas ?
relocations are producing a climate of harmful social uncertainty for social progress .
if I were to choose just one of these , it would be the energy issue .
Prince Felipe quite rightly called on the governments of Spain and the United Kingdom to resolve the damaging Gibraltar conflict .
unfortunately , the Commission action plan does not go far enough in this direction .
local labour markets are affected to a lesser extent by the fluctuating fortunes of the world market . This means that during a period like the present one , with a sluggish world economy , local markets manage best , relatively speaking .
Mr President , I shall focus on Mr Colajanni &apos;s report . I would like to congratulate him on his excellent work and on having prepared such a well-structured and comprehensive report .
today , the new Member States in particular require support in order to work as equals with the other Members , without eating into the other countries ’ budgets .
it is undoubtedly a difficult issue which changes certain fundamental elements of our European Union tradition , and that is the notion of the rotating six-month Presidency .
that is not making anybody complicit .
 
actions are what matter , and in that sense it is disturbing that one of the most significant of the four conditions which the international community had dictated to President Milosevic has not been met . I am referring to the withdrawal of security forces from the area .
to take just two points of criticism : there is no coherence in the measures taken and the objectives are far too ambitious .
the negotiations with Turkey on this topic should , however , be kept strictly separate from the country &apos;s accession negotiations .
if this is the case , I would urge the Commission , including you and the Commissioner for Trade , to make a far greater effort to ensure that some of the countries which really depend on exports to non-EU countries - and here I am thinking primarily of Denmark - will again be able to export to the United States , Japan , Russia and the many other countries which have stopped their imports from the EU , an action which is basically a technical trade barrier .
I also hope that this report has added a positive note to the important work being carried out by the Mr Kallas and the Commission and also our Parliament in the fight against fraud .
a large amount of food is exported into the European market from such countries .
with it the number of provisions will fall to less than a third of what there are at present .
I would add that the same philosophy will inform our decisions regarding the programmes for the trans-European networks .
this is what has happened in the case of Famagusta .
but I would just like to make some factual remarks .
we must ask ourselves whether we are here solely to accept , at any time and under any kind of pressure , what the Council or the Commission proposes .
exactly the opposite !
it is essential , in my view , to provide a proportionate and balanced legal basis for the retention of data that would otherwise be erased or anonymised .
vital to me , as a supporter of Andalusian autonomy , in order to safeguard the future , are the reform of the common agricultural policy , the debate on rural development , codecision in agriculture and food safety , in order to prevent extremely costly crises and alarm amongst consumers .
we know that this matter is primarily the responsibility of the Member States , which need to organise themselves and build up their own control and prevention resources . We also know that they should give priority to actions of this kind , and to national afforestation projects , under their national regional development programmes .
the example of the arrival of a few thousand Kurds in Bari effectively highlighted the weaknesses and gaps involving this issue and in terms of the application of existing rules .
a single voice for the Eurozone in external relations has nothing to do with the fact that these three gentlemen influence foreign exchange rates .
this Treaty is an integral part of the securitarianism that has been brought in under cover of the &apos; fight against terrorism &apos; , with the aim of strengthening cross-border cooperation at EU level in the field of &apos; combating terrorism &apos; , cross-border crime and immigration .
politically I believe in a political Commission .
so we must make sure that European e-commerce really functions and consumers have right choices there .
we practise respect and democracy ; we demand democracy and respect .
my country , Austria , is particularly affected , due to its geographical proximity to the eastern European states .
new frontiers in book production
. ( PT ) Air accident rates vary from region to region , since aircraft built in Western Europe are amongst the safest in the world .
( PT ) Immigration is a serious problem , which requires a realistic and responsible response from the Community Institutions .
the Green Paper on territorial cohesion entitled &apos; Turning territorial diversity into strength &apos; launches a broad consultation with regional and local authorities , associations , NGOs and civil society with the aim of promoting a common understanding of this new concept , along with its implications for the EU &apos;s future regional policy , without however offering a definition of &apos; territorial cohesion &apos; .
the rapporteur , Mrs Breyer , has the floor .
now more than ever , Member States must demonstrate their solidarity and cooperate in order to ensure the security of their energy reserves .
I also support the rapporteur &apos;s contention that the concept of safe third European states should not be targeted by a separate regulation , but should rather be dealt with as part of the comprehensive approach established by the framework of the Directive on asylum policy .
our group has called for a new Commission to be appointed immediately .
finally , the European Council has adopted the excellent and particularly pragmatic Hague programme with a view to strengthening the three pillars constituted by freedom , security and justice .
the budget for the &apos; culture programme 2007 &apos; for the period 2007-2013 now represents just 0.04 % of the European Union &apos;s budget granted in the financial perspective .
I am sure we will vote for the resolution unanimously .
there are , however , other important matters discussed in the report , for example the need to gather comparable statistics concerning , respectively , men ’ s and women ’ s wages and concerning the fight against discrimination .
I welcome the adoption of this report , which calls for better representation for the Community institutions in international organisations .
our colleague told us yesterday that it was a private photograph .
what steps does the Commission intend to take to ensure that all the practical effects of liberalisation are addressed and to prevent certain Member States from setting up internal mechanisms that could hinder liberalisation ?
as a result , the agreement may have had the opposite to the desired effect .
Mr Voggenhuber prepared a very good report concerning the vital issue of fundamental rights .
in this context we think that the EIB , which has developed unquestionable expertise in these matters , can make an important contribution .
therefore logic calls for an increase in the tiny quota of 200 tonnes proposed by the n to 1000 or 1200 tonnes in accordance with the projection included in the draft resolution .
this is a key principle that applies to all the funds that we are talking about .
investment must therefore be as productive as possible , concentrated in areas where it can be used to best effect .
let me now turn to the instrument of macro-financial assistance and to its future under the Lisbon Treaty .
I immediately agreed to the suggestion and am still happy that the lists of signatures that subsequently circulated in Parliament included the names of two members of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats and two members of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party .
for we all know - and I should once again like to specifically point out - that over 50 % of the long-term unemployed in Europe are inadequately or wrongly trained and further trained .
– Mr President , it is customary for speakers to thank the rapporteur , but I want , today , to break this rule by thanking the petitioner , Mrs Louise McVay , for submitting this petition and thereby drawing attention not only to her own plight but also to the immense difficulties faced by MS sufferers in the EU , and the unequal treatment they receive .
we cannot at the present time predict how far this conflict may spread and what may happen .
that is why we should send out a clear signal based on Mr Cox &apos;s proposal - clear , efficient rules .
that means that there really is a problem , and I appeal to the sense of justice of the largest groups , and to your own , Mr President , to see to it that we address the reform of this system as soon as possible .
this fence will also make it impossible to achieve what we in the European Union have succeeded in doing , namely establishing a network of inter-connected interests .
similarly , there is doubt as to whether it transposed it correctly .
it is true to say that sometimes things have to be required as a matter of policy to get new paths opened up , and that is what we are doing with this report , in order - or so we hope - to achieve the climate protection goals using a European energy policy ; about that , there is consensus in this House .
I consider this essential , as we have seen how useful cooperation with the United States has been .
in Germany there was a feeling , when Chancellor Merkel came back from Brussels , that she wanted to show the Greeks what it is like to be at rock bottom before she would be willing to actually help them .
firstly , there is the general question of state aid .
they resulted in a measure of progress , but also in many regrets .
oral questions and written statements ( tabling ) : see Minutes
we are struggling with Amendments Nos 10 and 13 which exclude mixtures and premixtures containing flavourings and appetite stimulants from the labelling requirement .
in this Parliament we know all too well what the countries in your region have gone through in the past decade , and in particular the ordeal by arms and violence which you have all had to live through , but nonetheless yours is a country which in its current phase brings us a certain message of hope .
the next item is the debate on the report by Mrs Toia , on behalf of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy , on European Electronic Communications Regulation and Markets 2004 ( 2005 / 2052 ( INI ) ) ( A6-0305 / 2005 ) .
what sort of law school did the people who approve such arbitrary reversals attend ?
I have to say that there is a story behind this .
common asylum and immigration policies must not be dependent on combating terrorism , an approach that would consider anything foreign to be potentially dangerous and criminalise all migrants or would view them as nothing more than economic resource .
it inevitably led to misgrading .
that is a good suggestion !
the people of Guatemala , like other peoples in Latin America , have been tragically tried by foreign intervention and exploitation by the local oligarchy .
Ecofin cleared it last week and so did the Social Affairs Council .
but we cannot avoid condemning its minimalist aspect , despite all the goodwill of the rapporteur , whom we sincerely thank for her work .
the agenda is published in the session document which contains the same name and also on the European Parliament &apos;s website .
rapporteur . - ( FI ) Mr President , the European Union can provide developing countries and other countries not in the EU with financial assistance in the form of credit at low interest rates from the European Investment Bank .
I want to focus on a couple of the principal points that she makes .
I believe this very sincerely because it might well give false expectations and delay further the adjustments that might well be needed .
it is important to bear in mind that we cannot predict now where the next conflict might arise , the number of people in immediate danger , nor their particular circumstances .
the political difference between us is not a question of whether or not to adopt modern methods , but of what our concept of these modern methods is , particularly on the place and the role which all men and women , bar none , must play , both as workers and as citizens .
this is an opportunity for innovation ; is the Commission willing to take action in this area even outside the European Union ?
diesel , as a fuel , should not therefore be treated unfairly from a taxation point of view , as has also been pointed out in this House .
the emphasis that the PPE-DE Group members are placing upon this suggests that they have a determination not to seek consensus and to look rather to create problems for the adoption of this package .
in some areas , however , it falls short of the requirements of the Convention , in particular with regard to access to justice , insofar as there are no established support mechanisms for reducing or eliminating recurring financial obstacles ; indeed , access to justice is often restricted precisely because those seeking justice do not have the necessary financial resources .
rapporteur . - Mr President , just briefly , I was very honoured to be a rapporteur when we had the chance to repeal , instead of adopting , a piece of legislation .
we must not go back down the route of farm subsidies , only to realise a few years later that our well-meaning policy is incompatible with WTO requirements .
that , I repeat , is why I agree with this request to preserve Mr Camre &apos;s immunity , regardless of the reservations , regardless of the distaste we feel for the opinions of the Member .
( SK ) Mr President , what is particularly alarming about the murder of the Governor of Punjab , Salmaan Taseer , is the background to this violent act .
the European Council has also asked all Member States to participate fully in helping to achieve , on the basis of solidarity and careful budgetary management , a fair and balanced outcome that is acceptable to all .
the answer is : a green field with ten thin cows all milking each other.I am convinced that if the European Union does not make some crucial decisions within one or two years – decisions which the Member States will implement – then in twenty years ’ time this could be the coat of arms of the EU too , only with the difference that there will be more cows , and they may be even thinner .
we must continue the dialogue with the Council so that together we can successfully resolve these issues before the end of the present parliamentary term .
they will exacerbate unemployment and will fuel social tensions .
the present interpretation was adopted which , in fact , only allows for one initial signature to be on a Rule 48 resolution and for people having to sign it in a special office , which avoids having to walk a line of people demanding that they actually sign up to particular Rule 48 resolutions .
we have to face up to the fact that there has not been full cooperation between Member States .
to succeed , progress must be based on epidemiological and economic criteria which have been worked out in the rather difficult passage of these proposals to this stage .
I say again , I have far more confidence in engineers and researchers than I do in businessmen .
it is often asserted , and I have read in numerous newspaper articles , that the European Union is now deciding to require labelling only above 0.5 % or even 1 % , which is of course nonsense .
the same applies to pedestrian safety .
the British Presidency is determined to make active progress on the road to a restrictive and more transparent European Union arms export policy .
do you not believe that the European Union should take a global approach to these issues , in order to establish general principles for the transmission and protection of data with our American partners .
the Prime Minister , Mr Rexhepi , rose to the occasion .
lastly , Mr President , I wish to thank all my colleagues in the Committee on Citizens &apos; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , whose amendments have contributed to improving this report .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
in conclusion , I understand and approve of Israel &apos;s need for security and the Palestinians &apos; desire for recognition .
what is currently happening with the announced amendment to the Treaty of Lisbon shows that everything that EU leaders have said about the importance of the national parliaments and the European Parliament , the deepening of democracy , and the sustainability of the Treaty itself , has been nothing more than propaganda .
( NL ) Mr President , the new Directive on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control ( IPPC Directive ) will ensure that businesses have to equip all large installations with the best available technology .
there is a ray of hope : the peace talks in Machakos in Kenya , which have led to the conclusion of a ceasefire agreement . This has been drafted , but is not yet in force .
as Parliament , we need stringent monitoring and evaluation with regular reports to this House and its Committee on Budgets and Committee on Budgetary Control , because we want to increase this Fund if possible over the next few years : to do that , we of course need the confidence of this House in the workings of the Fund .
this is not the time or the place to discuss the various problems , however .
therefore , whilst any delay to the funding of such programmes is welcome , I cannot support an amendment which accepts in principle that the EEAS , together with other new budget programmes contained in the Treaty , should indeed be funded at &quot; such time as the Treaty is ratified by all 27 Member States &quot; .
last year , when the increase in excise duty on alcohol and alcoholic drinks was discussed by the Ecofin Council , some Member States raised the issue of the difference between the taxation of beer and the taxation of wine .
Mr President , there are too many resolutions which have not been acted upon , and sometimes we too , as Members of Parliament , are guilty of thinking we have resolved a problem just by producing a resolution .
as a result , the Community is once again lumbered with the consequences of this short-sightedness , the clash of cultures , the forming of ghettos , crime as a result of people being uprooted and eventually , the breakdown of a whole community .
the feeling that Europe is distant is a real feeling and one that is becoming more and more widespread among the citizens .
the main issue which the Commissioner has correctly identified and which is in the main part of this question is what we should do to get tourism recognized within the Treaty .
promoting energy production from renewable resources , solar , wind and hydro power , is the only sustainable energy policy .
further discussions related to questions about regulation versus stimulus measures .
while we understand the needs and requirements of many in the ten new Member States , it is of little comfort to those who will lose out substantially .
nonetheless , we do have a duty and a responsibility to help them establish coexistence at national level : the next step will then follow by itself .
the Commission also notes that the volume and direction of mobility flows within the EU are driven by general labour supply and demand rather than by rules restricting labour market access .
it hopes that joining ASEAN will contribute to the promotion of these fundamental values in Burma .
we have a consensus .
colleagues from big groups elaborating the political message the Chair wants to hear are treated with great generosity .
this situation has also hindered the professional development of women and has contributed to the consolidation of gender stereotypes in relation to work .
such action , which adds to monitoring and bureaucracy , must be totally transparent , however , so that everyone knows what is actually going on .
as a representative of the European People &apos;s Party , I should particularly like to point out that whilst we cannot prevent disasters , as administrators , as parliamentarians , we must take the opportunity to deal with matters in a completely effective way .
it is therefore the responsibility of the European Parliament to denounce the risk of creating in this way , in some cases , a more uncertain type of law , a less secure type , so-called &apos; soft law &apos; - which is less binding and which can be translated into a sham harmonisation and an uncertain transposition into national laws and regulations .
in the past we had an open stable door , with the result that a variety of chemicals could , without further ado , be placed on the market and used as one saw fit .
it is very difficult to see what balance is in this case , because the issues and problems faced by those regions are very different .
I am baffled at the notion of extending the term of copyright , whether it is to 70 years or 95 years , and I am baffled by it not just because it is dubious and almost out of step with the digital age but also because , quite clearly , a move like that will primarily benefit industrial interests and not struggling artists .
when hundreds of thousands of people representing NGOs and church groups gather on the streets to express their concern and choose to do so at a series of international meetings , it is not just a coincidence .
first : in 1991 , the European heads of state and government expressly recognised the importance of European political parties in Article 138a of the Treaty of Amsterdam , guided by the idea that full-blown democracy in the European Union cannot be achieved without solidly-funded European political parties set on a reliable legal basis .
the analysis of the current legislation and proposals to review or improve it should focus on an assessment of these distortions .
this proposal will have a substantial impact on the European Union &apos;s biotechnology industry , on the EU &apos;s research programme and , in particular , on the priorities of the Sixth Framework Programme for Research .
financial resources must be devoted to preventing violence by teaching how to behave with empathy , and not simply to alleviating the effects of violence .
you talked about a ‘ tool in your box ’ .
the proposals would have an adverse impact on media freedom and on journalistic independence .
let us just have the meetings and actually , for the very first time , get the envoys meeting with the negotiators and having the chance to explore the positions in a way that we have not done before .
furthermore , there is no proposal on a proper , legally binding burden-sharing mechanism and this , too , creates difficulties for a number of Member States , and indeed for this Parliament .
we are going for a final spurt in order to be able to vote on the stability instrument in June , at first reading .
what we do not want is to establish sustainable energy policy in Europe and then end up doing something like importing the products .
making grand speeches does not help if the money is not made available to upgrade the trans-European networks .
let us realise that we still have a long way to go before this is really understood .
this is due to the omissions in the Treaty , and also perhaps to Parliament itself .
the difference is , in itself , marginal . I am all in favour of decentralisation and like to see things done on a small scale , but I want to say to my esteemed fellow MEPs that globalisation is on the way for agriculture too .
however , I do not think that is the case .
Mr President , President of the European Central Bank , Commissioner Solbes , on behalf of the Italian Radicals of the Technical Group of Independent Members , I believe that the objective which the European Central Bank set itself - which is the objective enshrined in the Treaty and in the best economic doctrine , that is to curb inflation - has in actual fact been achieved .
I am pleased to find that this problem is accepted by all sides of the House and hope that Parliament will take a concerted approach to this issue .
one said that reform must mean the dismantling of social rights ; another that it must involve more social rights .
I am not sure whether we would go as far as Mr Monti - I believe he has referred to state aids in the past as evil - but we certainly believe that it is necessary to restrict state aid in order to maintain economic efficiency and economic prosperity and a level playing field between companies in different Member States .
in reply , then , to the first question , the Council has not set an objective for energy security , as mentioned by the honourable Member , nor , to the best of the Council &apos;s knowledge , is any legislative proposal of this nature being prepared by the Commission .
should we remove the huge crucifixes on mountain tops which tower over cities and valleys ?
but it is an insufficient step forward , especially as regards the capacity of the Union to function with over 20 Member States .
until now , financial support for our banana producers has been provided through the POSEI ( Programme of Options Specifically Relating to Remoteness and Insularity ) grants , however the latest reform of POSEI back in 2006 does not cater in any way for these latest agreements .
let me recall that the ultimate objective of the Savings Tax Directive is automatic exchange of information on as wide a basis as possible , as this is the only reasonable tool to enable the country of residence of the taxpayer to apply its own tax rules to cross-border income from savings .
if it cannot be given now , I would be glad of an assurance that it will be provided in writing .
it is vital , however , that the EU countries are not , from the very start , guilty of politically influenced discrimination towards the new Member States , as this would be seen by public opinion in Central and Eastern Europe as being an indication that some applicant countries were &apos; more welcome in the EU &apos; than others .
I would like to draw the Commission &apos;s attention to a number of points .
we are unhappy about an issue of method , because the European Parliament ’ s key requests were not taken into consideration , and we are unhappy due to an issue of substance because this decision contains no guarantee that the application will be limited to international trafficking .
I will not use the original Gaelic : &apos; Who shall speak for the lonely and the oppressed ?
thank you , Mr President .
the former is clearly as impossible as it would be totally undesirable .
it is unacceptable for Dutch fishermen who are allowed to catch 10 % of the Total Allowed Catch , the TAC , for cod , to be far more restricted in their fishing activities than British fishermen who account for 40 % of the TAC .
you do not distort the market by drinking less alcohol .
the President of the Hellenic Republic went on an official visit and the Albanian Muslims booed him and there were incidents and a terrible hullabaloo .
we want a true culture of competition in Europe .
in conclusion , Prime Minister , I would say , do as your countryman Justus Lipsius advised : be stoical in adversity , embrace necessity and be constant in your faith in Europe .
we more than owe that to our enterprises and thus , also to our workers .
coordinated action between the US and the EU is also vital to reach a more mature stage in economic and trade relations between both sides , leading to the creation of a de facto transatlantic market by 2015 , with reduced bureaucracy and , as a result , a more stable and attractive environment for businesses in both markets , which offers them lower operating costs .
what , though , of the transposal of the first railway package ?
but it is not a question of us blocking anything .
amendments to this effect are before the House .
and our dependency stands at 75 % .
finally , the European Parliament must formally be associated with the European Union delegation to these conferences and I look forward to a commitment on that from the Commission .
I would like to mention a solution which has been promoted for many years by the Christian and Democratic Union - Czechoslovak People &apos;s Party ( KDU-ČSL ) in the Czech Republic .
the issue of the country &apos;s name has been dragging on for too long and the atmosphere in the country has been worsening for some time .
there is a reason for this obscurity .
I am afraid this is not the &quot; fullest possible details &quot; , since half of it is a letter to Mr Prodi .
we are fully aware of this .
but everybody stays silent .
these arrangements constitute an exception to the general law on excise duties for mineral oils ; the harmonisation of the structure of excise duties for mineral oils is the subject of Directive 92 / 81 / EEC , which the present directive is seeking to amend .
from this perspective , Commissioner Frattini , congratulations on the guarantees you have given us that greater security must not undermine freedom , and on your initiative in the Council as regards the European Day against the Death Penalty .
on the contrary , I would like to say that Belgium made an excellent job of handling the trialogue between the Commission , the Council and Parliament .
we condemn this policy , which involves centralisation in order to disarm us further , and we obviously voted against it .
having stated in September that it was determined to supervise the markets , the European Parliament has today , 11 November , sent another powerful message to the rest of the world .
the Hungarian Presidency &apos;s intention to conclude the negotiations in the first half of 2011 makes us very optimistic about the future of the Balkan region and about the accession of those countries to the European Union .
the nominees all attended confirmation hearings in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs last week .
although trade union representatives have from time to time officially expressed their acute concern about the intensification of the exhausting working times of workers and about the deterioration in training provided for cabin crews being promoted in the relevant regulation , unfortunately these elements are not taken into account .
since research in the area of HIV / Aids is essential , I voted for the resolution .
the next item is a continuation of the debate on the statements by the Council and the Commission on illegal exploitation of the wealth of the Democratic Republic of Congo .
Mr Bowis has managed to handle such a controversial topic in such a way that we are on the verge of reaching agreement , and that it really is possible to bring this matter to a conclusion at first reading and before enlargement .
Mr President , I could not agree more with Mrs Buitenweg .
for example , during 1992 , Germany received approximately 60 % of the total number of asylum seekers in the EU .
debate will always make emotions stronger . But the law will be applied exactly , and competition will prevail .
everybody is aware that this is very difficult .
I hope it is a step closer to getting the moratorium lifted so that we can start to approve new GM products which will be of benefit to all and utilise the new legislation , of which I was the author last year .
there is no real danger of over-centralization in the long-term future .
firstly , we have appointed a special representative , Mr Heikki Talvitie , who represents us in the region , and particularly in Georgia .
I myself have been in contact with him and have met many other people who have approached his office .
first of all , the new democratic Russia needs us to take into consideration the huge efforts it must make to overcome the legacy of 80 years of communism .
this resolution reflects a widely held sense of outrage .
approximately EUR 86 billion has been allocated to research and innovation for the 2007-2013 period .
the human and environmental costs of the economic warfare imposed on all the nations are devastating .
of course there were countries where Nazism enabled or helped to bring about the subsequent establishment of Communism and its associated crimes .
those relations or any problems that there may be are settled in the independent courts of the Spanish State .
that is why we will be voting against - and we are against - the provision that allows the Member States , in certain cases , to refuse entry to a child aged over 12 years .
as far as this process is concerned , the European Union is unanimously behind the so-called roadmap , which it wants not just published but implemented as quickly as possible .
for this reason it is crucial that the Commission refrains from allocating funds currently found within Progress .
on that basis , Madam Vice-President , you continue to have our full support .
if the illegal capture of State or government facilities , public modes of transport , infrastructures or public places constitutes a terrorist offence or if the legitimate expression of our freedoms of expression and association , our trade union rights , could , in the future , be criminalised or described as terrorism , if those elements are retained , by voting in favour of these reports we will be renouncing all of our democratic rights .
 
I would like everyone here present and the Commissioner to devote their attention to this now .
it would therefore be extremely unfair , counterproductive and exploitative to do as Mr De Magistris is requesting : imposing inhibitory penalties and measures today would harm institutions that are cooperating fully with the European Union as they attempt to close this terrible chapter in the age-old history of Naples and Campania through the efficient use of European and national resources .
( HU ) In 1992 , the UN declared 17 October the International Day of Poverty .
the Union is called upon to play a leading and constructive role at an increased level of international cooperation .
Mr President , I would like firstly to thank Mrs Fourtou for the work she has done in the Committee .
however , we believe that the continued occupancy of two seats by the European Parliament represents poor value for money to the European taxpayer and , therefore , we can not support any proposal to purchase the Strasbourg parliament buildings .
action plans form a good method of implementing this . It is understandable that countries such as Moldavia and the Ukraine should ask why the Commission ’ s plans avoid the issue of their possible EU membership .
- ( DA ) The Danish Social Democrats have today voted in favour of appointing nine new members of the Court of Auditors .
however , if we lack the courage to do this , it is important to me that we retain the principle of relative stability .
the Council presidency , proud of its newfound glory , has defined , regulated and established legal bases .
we must of course prioritise action programmes on the street , in prisons and also in places of nocturnal entertainment where the simultaneous consumption of more than one drug is prevalent .
it is that , of course .
in this area , different countries are at different stages and development will continue .
this will favour big countries , the former colonial powers .
believe me .
Turkey needs to take a clear stand on this matter .
I believe this is incredibly important as it is only together with Russia that real security in our region can be established .
Mr President , it must be very difficult for the Commissioner to come here with a brief that he may not know quite as much about as some of the speakers .
I would therefore express the wish that the parliamentary mission that will soon visit the region should carry with it this concern for balance and be able to contribute actively to seeking a peaceful solution between people of good will in the region , so affirming our intransigence towards intolerance and messages of hatred while , at the same time , displaying what binds us together as human beings .
in many cases , this is not the case .
I also want to address the particular point about the helpdesk and small businesses .
in this case , then , we are creating , in the name of political unification , an agency which has no reason to exist since these matters could very easily have been organised at multilateral level within the framework of existing mechanisms such as the ICAO .
however , violence against women does not manifest itself only through physical abuse .
the Council &apos;s task is now to secure the unity needed for the Treaty in accordance with a principle of maximum limitation of exceptions ; to avoid , in the derogations from the Charter , hidden erosion due to opt-out clauses in the original gentlemen &apos;s agreements ( such as the Ioannina compromise ) and to ensure that the Treaty is of a unitary rather than a fragmented order .
this is considered to be a bureaucratic requirement by the administrations of certain Member States , but it should be viewed differently .
we have subdivided your proposals on this and are able to take account of some .
although Conservative MEPs wish to combat corruption , we believe that this matter should not be legislated on at a European level but should be dealt with internally by Member States .
Madam President , I am not going to turn this into a procedural issue , but I would like to draw your attention to a situation which is taking place in Spain .
the CFP should also guarantee competitiveness in a globalised world of fisheries products .
the European Parliament is developing a high-quality environmental policy , in conjunction with a responsible transport policy .
fourthly and finally , I would like to congratulate Commissioner Malmström for her assurances that a legislative initiative on the evaluation system will be presented this autumn .
at present , there are very few alternatives to this activity . It also creates a huge amount of employment .
it is quite clear that in all this , Albania , in particular , must implement the existing framework for combating organised crime and corruption .
Mr President , I would like to talk about the crux of the matter , which is neither political refugees nor family reunification .
we have to get back into dialogue between the parties and we have to do that as a matter of urgency .
the EU ’ s ten new Member States are ten old countries of Europe .
this is an initiative of the Committee on International Trade , of which I am chair , and it is as chair that I am asking this question , in relation to which the political groups have reached agreement by consensus .
it is also quite unacceptable to stigmatise the British farmers who have suffered a great deal and who have made Herculean efforts .
it has always been said that the French authorities were largely responsible for the mistake that was made , so it is therefore appropriate that they should now resolve the problem .
I can hear people wondering whether such a decision would have disastrous socio-economic consequences for the population but , faced with the violence of 28 September , we must recognise that the Guinean Government is scarcely concerned about the living conditions of its citizens and that it leaves us with no other option than to be firm .
the EU ’ s high tariff barriers cruelly shut out the Third World from trade highways .
this can only contribute to a greater openness in dealing with human rights issues .
Mr Swoboda , Mr Hänsch , Mr Voggenhuber and Mr Corbett have pointed out another major problem area , upon which I would like to avoid any misunderstanding , regarding the structuring of the vigorous debate on Europe .
.
Mr President , Commissioner , honourable Members , the overall objective of the railway package under discussion here today is fast liberalisation of the European railways .
with this important proviso , a point that must be considered is the fact that , because borders within the Schengen Area are effectively open , decisions taken within one Member State may have implications for another .
I think that we must very positively and attentively study academic failure , which is endemic in all our countries , and ask ourselves why academic failure exists and how to remedy it .
we are convinced that the ENPI will give us a better , more flexible and more focused instrument with which we can support reforms and cross-border cooperation .
I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament .
Mr President , Mrs Randzio-Plath has , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , raised questions on a particularly important issue , namely the Community initiatives on the future of pension systems .
you must make peace with your enemy , not with your friend .
the report clearly articulates the need for the European Union to &apos; punch its weight &apos; at the United Nations .
even though the European Parliament &apos;s report on Investing in the future : a new Multiannual Financial Framework ( MFF ) for a competitive , sustainable and inclusive Europe contains many ideas that should be supported , I did not support it because I believe that it damages the European Union &apos;s image in the eyes of its residents .
I am thinking here of a compatibility clause of the sort that exists in the cultural and environmental domains , a clause that would make it possible to take due account - and I stress the word &apos; due &apos; - of the specific nature of sport in the formulation of the general policy or specific policies of the Community .
I would propose a few amendments , namely 10 , 13 and 16 with regard to cheques .
I would like to say to Mr Marinescu that it was indeed agreed in the Council &apos;s guidelines that strengthening the External Action Service would not result in higher costs .
the Commission will be making an assessment of the primary markets of all raw materials in the coming months .
part of that action is to prevent more people becoming disabled .
that is why they do not , under any circumstances , want to see their pensions gambled on the stock exchange .
we therefore continue to prefer the way in which things are done in the Netherlands , where fines and proceeds from seizures are added to the general resources and where rehabilitation programmes are funded from the general resources .
I know the details well , the good points as well as the bad .
the second point is that if you withdraw your question you can reformulate it .
but I am afraid that we are re-establishing a policy which , for decades , has permitted us to hide behind the Greeks and say that the Greeks would never agree to it .
from the outset , Portuguese workers saw their freedom of movement restricted by barriers put up by Member States fearing disruption to their labour markets .
the EU , with its External Action Service , must begin to lead the strategy on diplomacy in the area of climate change as soon as possible and ensure that , above all , Europe speaks with one voice in talks with other countries and maintains the principled position , so that there can be a compulsory international climate change agreement as quickly as possible .
that sends a bad signal concerning our determination to hold the OECD countries to their current economic policy course despite the recent crises in , notably , Asia , and to respond to the challenges of globalization by enhancing the present open system for trade and investment .
this scrutiny facilitates MEPs &apos; and also citizens &apos; understanding of Parliament &apos;s particular set-up , governance structure and working methods .
but like the European Court of Justice - and probably also Parliament - the Council attaches great importance to the Financial Regulation being thoroughly modernised and completely recast .
a happy Christmas to everybody .
do we put a brave face on a bad job , rejoice in small improvements , thank the rapporteur for his good work and await the miracle that the Convention will bring to pass in fifteen months &apos; time , changing everything and making it better ?
let us not forget the fact that if the French Presidency preferred to let negotiations fail on the fallacious grounds that ‘ no deal is better than a bad deal ’ , then it did so above all because it feared being faced with a negative referendum ( despite the floods of propaganda and biased surveys , which claimed and still claim today , that the people are hoping and praying for a supranational Europe .
you have all expressed your broad agreement with the extension and the strengthening of these two important measures .
is this the management model and the model of social Europe that the Commission claims to defend , when it rides roughshod over the right to work and its social responsibilities ?
therefore , textile products being imported from Pakistan reduces their market , both in Europe and within Spain .
political views , for example as regards how large the public sector should be or how comprehensive the social security system should be , vary from one country in the Union to another .
furthermore , and as the European Commission study was charged with demonstrating , rapidly eliminating single hull tankers , as is proposed , will not lead to a substantial reduction in capacity for oil and , as the rapporteur states , the capacity and international recognition of European shipyards could even benefit by having new vessels to build .
it is my duty as an MEP , though I derive a certain satisfaction from performing it , to affirm that the city of Wrocław , well known as a centre of science in Poland , has a claim to being somewhere special in this regard .
welcome
however , in line with our traditional approach , we will continue to vote against granting discharge until we see real progress towards the achievement of an unqualified statement of assurance from the European Court of Auditors .
is it likely to turn Palestine into a new theocratic , fundamentalist regime ?
the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment , for which I am rapporteur , thinks it important in this context to specify that posted workers engaged in port dredging and in assisting shipping in port fall within the scope of the directive .
I have a question for you , Commissioner .
Parliament is also rightly critical of the way in which the Opel crisis was tackled by the Member States in question .
in this context , we now have ongoing negotiations between the Commission , Parliament and the Council with a view to establishing a more efficient evaluation system for Schengen .
taken to its logical conclusion , this means you can be appointed if you can no longer be elected .
the single market is our great strength and one of the great successes of European integration .
( SK ) If we actually want to overtake the US , Japan and other world leaders in science and technology and if we want Europe to set the tone , then the necessary preconditions must be created .
fourthly , high exchange reserves are an effective means of maintaining the banking system with its structural need for liquid assets . By definition , this is essential for the sound running of monetary policy and for defining interest rates .
the debate is closed .
one of the key issues which affects the whole of Central Asia is of course the question of transboundary water utilisation .
Russia , however , is not the USSR .
so , certainly , we are going to accord very high priority to nuclear safety in our relations with third countries , including some that you have mentioned .
this position , which is also that of the United Nations , the Council of Europe and all the other European institutions , including the European Parliament , the Council and the Commission , was confirmed on 10 May 2001 by the European Court of Human Rights .
I would like to point out that , according to various studies , young people who avail themselves of the opportunity to study or work abroad perform better in school , they are more successful and more competitive in terms of job hunting , and , moreover , in terms of their integration into society .
it is always the case , and it is one of the problems as we reach the second reading , that one knows a good deal more about what the Commission will approve than what it will not .
I am sure that this massive presence of European citizens at the doors of our Parliament will provide us with an enormous stimulus to carry out our work responsibly .
the European Parliament &apos;s 2003 resolution has been an effective part of an ongoing campaign to increase awareness .
Kosovo is part of the region which had already been given a European perspective in Thessaloniki in 2003 , and that has not changed .
as Scandinavian opponents to the Union we can also state that the &apos; core issues &apos; from the Scandinavian countries , openness and the environment have so far met with minimal success .
so far , Mr Prodi , you have shown no sign of making out a case for rehabilitation .
I offer my wholehearted support for any courageous action on the part of the Commission , i.e. also taking cases to court when interpretation is at issue , in order to establish correct interpretations with regard both to taxation and to other similar charges with which we have problems .
you quoted some figures which clearly illustrate that .
again , Mr President , thank you for your statement .
politically , I naturally share the Presidency &apos;s opinion of the two major crises - the economic crisis and the climate crisis - and of course these are the priority issues .
admittedly , the new double-hull legislation constitutes a notable advance in the field of preventing marine pollution , but there is a need to continue issuing standards enabling tankers and merchant ships to offer the maximum number of safeguards .
such dirigisme handicaps and endangers most of all small and medium-sized businesses , which were and still are the backbone of the German economy .
the &apos; road map &apos; has been completed , and the only thing that remains to be agreed on - and which I hope can be agreed before the Seville European Council - is the common position on agriculture .
because the status quo has not worked , does not work and never can work .
- ( FR ) Madam President , on behalf of my Independence and Democracy Group , I should like respectfully to welcome the Czech Presidency , and to do so by expressing the high regard in which we hold it , for the Czech people have experienced some great hardships and are better equipped than many of us to understand the value and the meaning of the word freedom .
the abolition of guide levels will allow the national administrations to each adopt and apply their own criteria for assessing if products are or are not being held for commercial purposes .
democratic institutions have been firmly established since 1996 , when the first direct presidential elections were held .
yet there is no coherent political message to them on land use and using their land to grow energy crops .
this House demands that you concentrate on your current responsibilities , not on your possible future career .
however , it has to prove its viability by attracting money from the private sector too , as the Commission also proposes .
I am not surprised that there is a certain amount of confusion among the Nationalists on this .
Mr President , it has already become evident here that three groups have proposed a joint motion for a resolution , and , in my opinion , it is very important that the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left and the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance have now united in a common campaign , because it is time we obtained some concrete results .
we must not send out the signal that trade in organs could be legal in some circumstances .
they have contributed valuable ideas and hard work on the amendments which led to the report being unanimously passed in committee .
Mr President , before taking advice from any expert it is wise to examine their record to check that they are competent .
it is still a characteristic of the European situation that European airspace belongs to those who are most overburdened on a global scale .
I agree with Mr Turmes on the need to protect the different national systems in force at the time that this directive is adopted .
as the House will understand , the Commission does not wish to make a pronouncement at present on either the various amendments , judgements and criticisms put forward - many of which I support - or the objections expressed in relation to the draft treaty .
we must of course prepare ourselves for the disasters that seem to come our way with ever-increasing frequency .
firstly , LIFE is the only direct financial instrument which is designed to promote environmental policy within the European Union .
in Germany , we call this kind of nitpicking &apos; counting peas &apos; .
these were not people who were denied opportunities by being on the fringes of our society .
the European Parliament pronounced itself in favour of such legislation in 2001 and 2004 , and the European Commission – which at the time was the Prodi Commission – did not take the matter further , putting forward the legal argument of the lack of legal basis and the political argument of the lack of the political majority in the Council needed to make progress .
in the rapporteur &apos;s view , these Commission reports do little more than sum up the projects that have been executed in those two years .
there is , therefore , a question as to whether , in the next six months , problems which are important to the European Union &apos;s residents are going to be discussed .
Mr Frattini , ladies and gentlemen , it has been clear for some time that the Iranian nuclear issue would be considered at the UN Security Council .
on the BakuTbilisiCeyhan pipeline , I can only say that it has been inaugurated today with the strong support of the European Union .
in summary , and in spite of the circumstances , I insist that in Valencia we have been able to confirm that the revitalisation of the Barcelona Process , six years after its launch , represents a strategic option for the future for the European Union and for each of its Member States and all of its democratic expressions , because I believe that the attempts at party politics , such as that made by the President of the Socialist Group , have no place here .
however , this freedom , which is of great value , must be used with respect .
I would therefore like to say this : anyone who votes in favour of enlargement today , anyone who supports the need for enlargement , must also support the establishment of an agreement on the fundamental reform of today &apos;s Europe .
given this unacceptable situation , when will the European institutions understand that this is their problem and one that affects them directly ?
we call on the Commission to withdraw it , but we also urge it to submit a new proposal based on the Amsterdam Treaty .
I also believe that underlining the need to support and promote the activity of SMEs at a cross-border level in the internal market is essential .
as far as information and research are concerned , the rapporteur would like to see a comparative study of the positions of Islamic and Muslim organizations in the Member States .
take , for example , the whole bail-out of Greece .
key priorities , such as transparency and consumer protection , will be pursued , while a bank crisis framework will aim to prevent and tackle future crises .
( BG ) I am taking the floor to explain why the Attack party delegation is voting against this report .
the next item is the report by Reinhard Rack , on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism , on &apos; Towards a new culture of urban mobility &apos; .
this makes it all the worse that some of us Europeans should have completely forgotten this country .
as a member of an ethnic minority traditionally present in the European Union , I am particularly pleased that the rights of ethnic minorities are mentioned as individual rights for the first time in Article 2 . I hope that group rights will follow as quickly as possible .
( RO ) I believe that strategic thinking is required long term about reforming the pensions system , both in the private and public sectors .
the reality is that the indigenous population has never been consulted democratically about the question whether they want to live in a multi-cultural country , and that is something that must change as a matter of urgency .
we cannot allow it and I will stand shoulder to shoulder with these small and medium-sized enterprises and defend them , so that we look after our traditions and Italy &apos;s strengths .
our concern here is not only with the cultivation of soya and rape , but to an equal degree with seed flax , camelina and many other plant proteins .
we must of course be able to guarantee the right to health and to ensure that all citizens enjoy that right .
now the Greens are talented politicians - and I say this in admiration .
in the United States and Japan , however , no publication is provided for and network industries freely dialogue with their national suppliers in order to establish technical specifications .
human rights represent an on-going problem where any presumed advance must be scrutinised closely .
Madam President , Commissioner , I would first of all like to express how pleased I am that agreement was reached between the European Parliament and the Council on the Third Energy Package , including the regulation on conditions for access to the gas transmission networks , for which I am the rapporteur .
at present , 43 countries worldwide still retain the death penalty .
if I arrive at an airport there are scarcely any checks on my luggage , in complete contrast to the situation in other continents .
Lithuania , too , has its sovereign right .
our latest information is that expert talks took place today concerning the bridge and that oil shipments through Estonia have resumed .
Mr President , all these goals require a greater commitment by all : by the Commission , by Parliament , by national parliaments and by governments .
composition of committees and delegations : see Minutes
the southern Caucasus could become a calvary but it could also remain a powder keg .
I am delighted that my Conservative colleagues will all be leaving the EPP Group shortly - an objective which I have worked towards for 10 years .
winter is approaching , as people have pointed out .
we do not want to move transport from the sea back to the roads and we want fair competition in northern Europe , in the European Union and in the Mediterranean area .
we do not have time to debate this now , but I believe that it is clear .
the debate is closed .
subject : Follow-up to Parliament &apos;s support for the Harrison Report on late payments
what I find worse , though , is that there was no reaction whatsoever to this incident from the Muslim quarters in Belgium .
the idea was that the whole European Union area would acquire a high level of environmental protection .
on this essential issue , the proposal is based on the recommendations of the International Zoo Sanitary Code , on reports of the Scientific Veterinary Committee and on the conclusions on panels of international experts consulted on the assessment of the rabies risk linked to movements of domestic carnivores .
the VicePresidents have to see it first , which is what has happened .
I know I speak on behalf of all Swedish Members and with the agreement of all the Swedish people when I say that this policy must come to an end .
I look forward to this with great excitement .
( PL ) Mr President , history tends to repeat itself .
the Commission would also like to express its support for a general exemption applicable to genuinely exceptional services , for humanitarian reasons or maintenance work which cannot be carried out elsewhere for example .
we simply wish to emphasise the importance of changing and streamlining the procedures for mobilising this fund .
I could , therefore , answer this question by saying that it is true that enlargement has been taken into account , but I would have to add immediately that it is not only in the budgetary figures that enlargement needs to be taken into account .
without a compromise on a peaceful solution , the future looks gruesomely violent .
we believe that should be our guiding principle .
my two colleagues and I will hold a debate on a joint paper within the Commission over the next few weeks and then we will consult with the Council .
we are aware that further amending budgets that will arise during the year will cause rather more difficulty .
granting discharge to a deficient system does nothing to help this situation .
I am nevertheless convinced that any regime for free circulation of advocates must be defined in a manner such as will guarantee that consumers have protection in all circumstances , meaning by this that the consumer can be sure of obtaining legal assistance from an advocate with qualifications in the law of the Member State concerned .
( PL ) Mr President , cohesion policy makes a crucial contribution to the integration of societies within the Union , as is emphasised in the report .
in addition to vitamins and minerals , there are also other substances covered by the term &quot; food supplements &quot; .
in Malaysia , the tactic of divide and rule on racial and religious lines has long been used by various elements of the economic and ruling elites .
these countries have been , and will be , the first to be affected by the refugee problem as a result of what is now happening in Afghanistan and in that part of the world .
that is all I have to say about investments in the United States .
I would just like to comment on one thing concerning the Stockholm Programme .
the people affected live in my electoral district , and I have met them .
it is true that Kazakhstan is the star of these countries , but a lot still has to be done .
first : charges for air security must be transparent and relate only to actual cost .
I did not refer to any micro-authority .
Mr President , over the last few months in Iraq , we have seen an increase in violence against religious minorities .
this is why it is necessary for measures to apply to the two sectors and the entire Union .
financial issues relating to energy savings were recognised by the Commission in the European Economic Recovery Plan of 26 November 2008 , and in other coordinated efforts which aim to help create jobs , which are often in small and medium-sized companies , since investments in energy efficiency , and especially in buildings , are mostly related to small-scale renovation projects .
we are quick to criticise the leading role of the USA - and I believe that this leading role is , in fact , too big .
I believe that the art museums of Europe have many more pictures and art works than they are able to display .
we are fully committed to supporting the country &apos;s future development .
Mr President , at Tel Aviv airport a document was handed over which seeks to prevent movement in the Palestinian occupied territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip .
Mr President , Commissioner , you know that very many eyes in Belgium are fixed on you at the moment .
on the subject of relations between the &apos; ins &apos; and the &apos; pre-ins &apos; , in accordance with the instructions of the Madrid European Council , the Commission and the European Monetary Institute are working hard to set up a new monetary system between the countries participating in the euro and those not participating at the outset .
there are many major problems outstanding , to which this Presidency will have to find solutions : for the Treaty of Lisbon , which requires final adoption , the path has already been outlined , but what is needed is a further impetus to ensure that the process is not drawn out beyond the current year .
Mr President , on behalf of the PSE Group I condemn in the strongest possible terms the killing of yet another individual at the demarcation line in Cyprus .
thirdly , I dispute the Commission view that the different components of the postal business constitute separate markets .
that means that this form of budget setting at the very least needs reflecting upon .
in conclusion , I would like to call for vigilance with regard to respect for the free movement of persons and equality of economic , social and political rights for Algerian nationals on European soil .
the forestry sector can make an important contribution to the attainment of the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives .
in any case , she can count on my commitment .
in addition , experts from Member States are invited to be present during the negotiations of a fisheries agreement or protocol .
these measures are anxiously awaited by the citizens of Europe .
quite the contrary , since the deplorable Schengen Agreement was first implemented , the lifting of internal border controls has led to an explosion in organised crime and all forms of trafficking .
the text which prevented COP 15 from drawing a complete blank , agreed at the end of a marathon of negotiations of a truly unprecedented duration and intensity , contains very little substance .
( PL ) Madam President , the fourth report on cohesion , recently published by the Commission , confirms that developmental disparities between the richest and the poorest regions in Europe are decreasing , something which was noted earlier .
in addition , pressuring countries to stay away from the Peace Prize ceremony shows that China has not yet matured into an international actor .
I believe that we are on the right track .
it is not just an interfering busybody committee .
like Mr Posselt I agree that human rights are very important .
we are aware that the debate has run over , and apologise . It is unfortunately often the case .
this situation has as much to do with income policies as with language problems and the shortage of affordable housing for these people .
in particular , small and medium-sized rural dairies in disadvantaged areas would find it practically impossible to cope with the competition , at which point the decoupling of the sector would do the rest , so that milk production would move very rapidly from grassland and disadvantaged areas to what is termed prime land .
vote
Mr President , I am not sure what this morning &apos;s debate is adding to the Turkish accession issue rather than giving an opportunity to a small number of vehement opponents of Turkish accession to repeat their arguments in this Chamber .
that is what the scientific committees are saying .
the first year , 2001 , was a special case which we discussed last year .
this is not an innocuous subject , however .
I shall pass this code to the new president-designate .
Europe must make the most of its history and develop its social model .
the administrative burden , particularly for firms with few employees , must not be allowed to grow any heavier , and from now on we must try to ensure that statistical reporting requirements are efficiently deregulated .
how effective this coordination will turn out to be will depend on the contents of the new implementing regulation and on the effectiveness of electronic data exchange as well as on good communications .
thirdly , I join with those asking that there be a single figure within the Commission handling all issues relating to the Roma .
consequently , it is very important to obtain accurate data and information on drugs and drug addiction , because these are global phenomena , posing a threat to the health , security and social well-being of us all .
 
let us reclaim utopia , and utopia for peace !
the debate is closed .
so , the Commission , in bringing forward their new proposals , must remember those sparsely populated rural areas and not put anything in this legislation which will deprive those areas of the opportunities of having those services .
the programme was agreed upon without any formal settlement .
however , our answer is that it was a well-chosen destination .
it remains crucial to help this country recover from the earthquake , but it is also important that the international community take advantage of this opportunity to help to resolve the economic , social and political inequalities within Haiti .
( LV ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , in talking about the draft budget for 2009 prepared by the European Commission , we ought first of all to note that the total amount of commitment appropriations is increasing to EUR 134.4 billion , which is a 3.1 % increase .
- secondly , we need direct protection from the risk so that the soil is not washed away ;
it is a serious process where the track record is playing a more and more important role .
on a final note , this Regulation and change to our Rules of Procedure are very important because they grant our citizens more access to internal documents of our Parliament and of the entire European Union , which improves transparency .
on the other hand , there is a need to expand the circle of friends who prefer the values and principles that are common in the EU .
it should not , after all , be possible to circumvent local delegations in practice by coming to special arrangements direct with Brussels .
an excellent result , but will we now be able to deliver the goods for some 500 million people ?
Madam President , this was an amendment which was originally introduced by the Green Group at the committee stage so I do not know what they are on about now .
after all these years there should at last be a powerful agreement on this .
it is clear that each country has different priorities in terms of the different economic sectors it wishes to protect .
such initiatives at European level would show our commitment to a better political future for the peoples of Iraq .
we have also tried , as far as possible , to preserve the amounts in the national budgets in order to be able to jointly finance the European funds , because otherwise , the reductions in investment expenditure that would have to be used to jointly finance European funds would have had very negative consequences in those countries .
I understand that this is not an exercise in revising financial perspectives , but we cannot continually take on new priorities to the detriment of the commitments that the European Union has already made .
entrusted to European civil servants who kowtow to the powerful lobbies emerging in Brussels , European competition policy is the main vector for ultra-liberal globalisation in our countries .
inevitably , as in any negotiation , it is a compromise .
that is why the EU can work only if the Convention and the governments decide on a real constitution , one that is democratic and transparent .
it could almost have been done on purpose !
the vote on this resolution is in danger of being redundant and , above all , is in danger of cutting short the debates taking place in the two other committees .
our sympathy and condolences go to the families of all those 200 victims and more than 250 wounded .
here , the visa requirement will remain for the time being .
the intention , of course , is that posted workers should be allowed to work under roughly the same conditions as people in the country to which they have been posted .
we are now faced with a situation where millions of people have been abducted , and they are no longer only women and children but also men .
that is normally allowed once the item under discussion on the agenda has been dealt with .
we can only try to introduce a partial convergence of requirements , and even this , as we have seen over the past months , has caused considerable problems .
in writing . - ( DE ) The Lisbon Treaty will make a militaristic Europe possible .
this means that work on the document has taken over two years .
it is my impression that behind many of the statements and much of the false information leaked to the European Union there was a very deliberate interest in obstructing talks between the European Union and Turkmenistan .
we , therefore , cannot support this specific point because of the breadth of our commitment and indeed the Treaty requirements relating to the function of the trans-European network strategy in connecting up the peripheral regions of the Union to the centre .
Mr Garriga Polledo , you mentioned the Structural Funds and asked whether we received reports from the Member States and how coordination with the Member States works .
29 . 2007 discharge : European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (
your rapporteur believes that the European Parliament has enriched the proposal , defining the priorities and adding different political connotations to the technical proposals , connotations that have come from the amendments of the different parliamentary groups and committees . Moreover , it gives the proposal as a whole a coherent structure that also , undoubtedly , identifies better with the problems that concern citizens and the less developed regions of Europe .
however , this changed in early 2007 , and in particular since mid-February .
we need new ground rules , which are more democratic , more transparent and , above all , fairer .
it is distressing to see that certain Member States have been condemned for not having correctly transposed the European directives in this field .
Mr Alexander , you have discovered today that you get not only criticism from this House , but also praise for the work you do .
Turkey had promised democratization and the Commission believed it .
it strengthens farms &apos; liquidity , enabling them to buy in feedingstuffs and sow new crops .
therefore , I support the report and I should like to thank the two rapporteurs .
one other thing which is new is that the Treaty uses exactly the same wording to describe the mandate of the Council as it does to describe that of Parliament .
on that occasion thousands of Frenchspeaking Belgian workers were put out of work , and nobody cared .
joint motion for a resolution on the Extraordinary European Council meeting on 21 September 2001 in Brussels
sometimes we are in no position to criticise .
the other element where a discussion is more open and more legitimate is what Member States do in the broader global discussion in the framework of OECD about the untying of aid .
I therefore wholeheartedly support the position of Mrs Miguélez Ramos that the European Union and the Commission can assign unused fishing quotas to countries wishing to use them , such as Portugal and Spain .
such European training is one element in ensuring that young farmers have the necessary knowledge of the CAP to make sound business decisions for the future .
the newly elected President of the United States has already issued a regulation banning the use of torture during hearings involving terrorist suspects .
it would be a pity if the European Parliament got itself too deeply involved in questions of linguistic arrangements that are more properly decided at national level .
as a result of this and of the Stockholm Programme , citizens are becoming ever easier to manipulate and ever more transparent .
the directive will further strengthen these by making it possible for an illegal worker to regularise his status simply by reporting his employer .
it is possible for these forests to receive aid only in exceptional circumstances such as natural disasters , but no longer for everyday requirements such as investment .
first is the idea that the fund can be used only for big companies .
in order to attain this objective , the most isolated regions of the Community , such as the Baltic Sea region , need to be better integrated into the European energy market .
but if progress is to be made in this matter we must also support the Single European Currency .
if politics is the art of the possible , the search for an agreement on the EU ’ s financial framework for 2007-2013 has proved to be the art of the minimum possible , which is not a cause for satisfaction .
your own role as Italian media proprietor has led to the government directing the content of both the private press and of public television .
five of the nine people for whose disappearance the IRA claims responsibility remain unaccounted for .
so we have not succeeded in our original aim of maintaining the population in rural areas .
Europe needs to achieve the important goal of combating climate change .
we are now at the end of this process and tomorrow , you will be voting on this excellent report .
on this basis , therefore , I would ask – and I know that we have very little time left – for a final effort from Mr Salafranca so that paragraphs 6 , 21 and 66 , which mention a Euro-Latin American free-trade area , can be worded in accordance with the Bregenz declaration .
well , I can tell you that my mother , who had never used a mobile phone , bought one in order to communicate with her grandchildren because she understood that this was the only way they could call her .
in many areas it can and will make an important contribution to the security of energy supply and to reducing our dependence on foreign imports , to climate protection and to employment and the economy in Europe &apos;s rural areas .
we can also take an approach that could well catch on , namely a ‘ pick and choose ’ approach , if I can put it that way , trying to save the most attractive parts of the constitution , but my question is , then , which parts ?
6 . Consumer protection (
among the opponents , Jacques Chirac , on behalf of France , stated that , at the risk of appearing hesitant about the very idea of limiting immigration , he was , , hostile to the very principle of quotas .
it calls for the European Parliament to be given a bigger say with regard to the adoption of common actions and positions and for it to be afforded a participatory role in international negotiations .
the next item is the recommendation for second reading ( A4-0093 / 96 ) on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection , on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council Decision adopting a Community action programme on the prevention of drug dependence within the framework for action in the field of public health ( 1996-2000 ) ( rapporteur : Mr Burtone ) .
but we should ensure that the discussions are substantive .
Ireland represents 1 % of the European Union , 1 % of the economy .
( PT ) Mr President , there has long been a need to create a financial transaction tax ( FTT ) at global level and , therefore , also at European Union level , just as there has been a need to put an end to tax havens and speculative financial products .
this problem may well be relevant in terms of competition .
it is my firm belief that the European Union &apos;s relationship with the Member States &apos; overseas territories and citizens of all those territories should become uniform , bearing in mind the equal treatment of the citizens of the European Union .
virtuous circulation means more productivity , more growth , more competitiveness and - I am addressing the left-wing Members here - more employment .
well , new technology brings new challenges : considerable economic challenges .
indeed , his report calls for greater resources so that the Union can better implement its objectives as set out in the Treaty of Lisbon .
much of the good work that the Member States have been doing in responding to the market downturn has to be focused for large-scale enterprises .
the fact that in 2010 , the total amount of bilateral trade between the EU and Japan was EUR 120 billion demonstrates that both sides are extremely important to each other as partners .
( DA ) Mr President , I , too , believe that this is a very well-balanced report with a clear , but also very flexible mandate for the Committee on Budgets , which is to negotiate an agreement with the Council , and I would reiterate Mrs Haug &apos;s call for it to be read - and for it also to be read by those Heads of State or Government and finance ministers who were quick to express their negativity with regard to the result .
( DA ) Mr President , I actually did not realise that we would , in fact , have the opportunity to give an explanation of vote in connection with this resolution , but , as that is the case , I will do so very briefly .
and that is why I will make a comment , and I would ask all those who still wish to tell Turkey that there was a genocide seventy-five years ago - which is true - in what way does that help the debate in Turkey today ?
it will give even more democratic legitimacy to the European legislative process , and this is vital to the political health of the Union .
food is an issue of vital importance for the health and safety of consumers and for the quality of life of our citizens .
the Council therefore eagerly anticipates the results of this study which , as I already mentioned , the Commission will be preparing in the form of a working document on the instruments available to Member States to assist them in dealing with this situation .
is there any means of guaranteeing that all future citizens of the EU receive an education ?
this will no doubt improve the possibility of a smooth and timely implementation .
my third point concerns the real-seat theory , to which only seven Member States remain committed - only seven !
Mr President , strengthening transatlantic relations is a welcome move .
I will not go into all of the background : the country has been in dire straits for more than 18 years , the humanitarian situation is horrible , and there is strife throughout the country .
faced with what is undoubtedly a complex situation , one thing is clear : there is no transitional law , there are no transitional provisions within the Treaty of Amsterdam . We are therefore called upon to come up with an integrated and constructive interpretation based on the principles underlying the Treaty .
when we talk of totalitarianism , we do so not because we want to live in the past .
I am giving the floor straight away to Mr Mandelson on behalf of the Commission .
it should also be said that 150 criminal investigations of the actions of particular Israeli soldiers are currently under way in Israel .
with respect to the wider impact of the proposed agreement , the Commission acknowledges that the interests of South Africa &apos;s neighbours and of the ACP group require special consideration .
but these are always the words that those who conduct preventative wars use to justify their actions .
lack of confidence in the reliability of banking systems would have serious consequences for the entire European economy .
there is currently a debate in the UK about the shortage of egg and sperm donations , particularly now that we are discussing a new law giving children born of such donations the right to know their parents .
in this way , Finland is adopting a position on the negotiated Treaty .
at the same time , these events have speeded up the decline in confidence in our security and the economy , areas which were already showing signs of weakness .
this provision does indeed allow the Member States to refuse to extradite a person in the case of special courts , if they do not have this right on the basis of their bilateral extradition agreement with the United States of America .
however , in order to arrive at an opinion we have had to make a sacrifice , because we were only able to achieve a majority in the committee by deleting Chapter 8 .
I think it is covered .
( RO ) At the same time with voting on this report , I would like to emphasize its importance for the future of the European citizens and of the entire European Union .
medical information on the Internet , freely accessible , is not monitored at present , which may have damaging consequences , as Commissioner Liikanen mentioned at the beginning of the debate .
the historic fifth round of enlargement will be completed when Bulgaria and Romania , whose intended commissioner candidates were approved here yesterday , join the European Union on 1 January .
however , the Commission has failed to draw the necessary conclusions from the current implementation of the Council regulation on the relaxation of cabotage . Without first conducting a necessary and substantial impact study , it is proceeding to amend it , thereby further aggravating the situation .
that is a case which will become very limited .
the European industry believes that recent imports from a number of third countries , especially from Asia , were made at very low prices .
I also commend her recommendations to this House , and indeed share her concerns .
the Europe of Brussels , far from strengthening France , as the UMP and PS claim , is making it weaker in all sectors : in the economic sector , with the destruction of our small farms , the collapse and relocation of our industries ; in the military sector , with the dismantlement of our army , now required to dissolve into a Euro corps ; in the demographic sector , with immigration that is threatening our national identity .
I therefore support a resolution that has been drawn up by the anti-nuclear power delegate of my home region of Upper Austria , which calls on the EU to introduce a levy on nuclear power .
nearly 40 % of small and medium sized enterprises in the region have trading links with other EU Member States .
however , when the Commission tells us that a new agreement will simply ratify a situation , we can plainly see , through the reports by the European Anti-Fraud Office ( OLAF ) , that the situation to which the Commission refers is not the real solution .
I hope the Member States will know how to react to the strong message being sent out by the European Union at this time of particular economic downturn by speeding up the transposition of the European directive into their national legislations .
it is therefore most important that , in application of the Convention on Biological Diversity , the issue of biodiversity should be integrated into Community policies thanks to this communication .
further training needs to be provided so that people can move around the labour market to the best job opportunities .
it is for this reason that I am calling upon the European Parliament to hold a conference of this kind this year in conjunction with the Apostolic See .
let us hope that this situation will not persist .
in fact , the procedure commenced in February 1996 has only now come to a conclusion .
and yet nearly 20 million Europeans out of work , and an unemployment rate of about 20 % among young people , might have prompted the Western powers to display a little more determination and imagination .
our willingness to help to find a solution to the internal political problems and the deadlock that exists there is not being satisfactorily addressed by President Lukashenko .
this is an initiative which flies in the face of every notion of solidarity with a Member State of the European Union , with Greece , which is one of the parties participating in the negotiating process under way within the framework of the UN to find a mutually acceptable and dignified solution , an honourable and logical compromise .
I wonder whether representatives of the oil companies or the bus companies are trying to get a squint at what the Socialist voting lists were .
I would like to give the Swedish government full marks for its work .
in many aspects this review of the CRD has turned out to be a timely and robust first response to the crisis .
Europe has a duty to offer the same guarantees to all individuals resident on European soil .
as you know , the package of proposals that the Commission has put forward consists of two directives and an action programme .
it is not , however , for Ford to solve this ; it is a task for the Belgian Government .
our relationship with Brazil does not end with the Summit ; we have other initiatives in parallel that help to give a fuller dimension to our bilateral , regional and global engagements , but I have more than exhausted my speaking time .
we now have the tools , for example the SWIFT clearing system in Europe , which would enable us to apply a tax .
and , incidentally , if rates were lowered , this could cause the value of the euro to fall even further , which would give a terrible impression when we are just about to embark upon the physical changeover of coins and notes .
currently a large number of administrative obstacles impede the effective functioning of the EU internal market .
the report is therefore a step along the road towards an EU which takes its people &apos;s wishes seriously .
under the Spanish Presidency , negotiations for future European enlargement are continuing at a strong pace .
the fact that poverty often has an impact on children too is in my view extremely sad and alarming .
this is not an isolated incident , unfortunately .
given this , I see no reason to vote against the mobilisation of the fund in this case .
the presidency of the Council of the European Union , in its contacts with the parties &apos; delegates , including recently during the meeting of the Association Council with Morocco last February , urged them to examine Mr Baker &apos;s proposal with a favourable predisposition .
enlargement of the Union to include countries from Central and Eastern Europe is absolutely unthinkable unless we have this kind of control over organized crime .
I do not know what would emerge if we were to write regular reports on the current Member States , applying the same yardsticks and using the same instruments .
it is very important that we do not forget , when setting out new objectives , about our previous policy , the Cohesion policy , the common agricultural policy or , if I look at Commissioner Andor , about renewing the European social model .
at the same time it underlines that those reforms and those changes are being made far too slowly , that there is much more to do .
this is where it needs to be stressed that the creation of an independent , non-partisan , reliable , transparent and effective justice system is of paramount importance , and it is also a precondition for the reinforcement of the rule of law and for the proper application of the acquis communautaire .
the mechanism - the Generalised System of Preferences - exists and could still be used . However , it is not being used , or at least it is not being used sufficiently .
in addition , this situation adversely affects the flexibility of the labour market and undermines an important condition for the success of the monetary union .
we need to develop more biofuels .
it goes without saying that the Commission looks forward to continued good cooperation with the Council and Parliament in support of these overall objectives .
regular updating is essential and , as provided for in the directive , it is desirable to adopt a streamlined procedure allowing for more rapid revision , instead of the more cumbersome and inevitably more convoluted procedure of legislative measures .
let us not therefore wear sackcloth and ashes , be issued with yellow cards or be depressed .
however , this can only be achieved by the renewal of the institutional and decision-making system of the European Union , because the Union cannot be enlarged any further if it does not change the way it functions .
we have to close this gap , and the European Research Area is a step in the right direction .
I would this evening therefore simply like to highlight five points .
firstly , my observation : I do not understand why President Van Rompuy is absent from such an important sitting - Minister , you are not a member of the European Council - and I believe that he could have been here .
what we most want for the EU is a return to a path of rapid growth , and this is primarily what the strategy should help accomplish .
the question before us is whether the 77 / 270 / Euratom Decision , which empowers the Commission to issue Euratom loans for the purpose of contributing to the financing of nuclear power stations , must be adapted to suit the circumstances of certain third countries about to join the EU , in which such investments are clearly of considerable significance .
question No 47 by ( H-0746 / 01 ) :
and only by opening up towards the east can the EU claim to speak as a cultural area and community of values for the whole of Europe .
the debate today and the resolution that we are about to adopt are indeed directed in the first instance at the Commission , because we intend to have some input into the progress report .
I would point out , however , that Question Time to the Council has been removed from the agenda for Wednesday .
this involves a greater commitment to civil crisis management , which in turn requires financial means and , as you know , and as the chairman of the Committee on Budgets has stressed once again , the budgetary rules are such that funds released elsewhere cannot simply be used for additional expenditure on external policy .
the Commission undertakes to take into account the spirit of Amendment No 5 .
recently , during the presidential election campaign , certain events have given rise to fears of a backward step on the road towards stabilising a country that claims to operate under the rule of democratic law .
the joint debate is closed .
issues like immigration , climate change and energy will take centre stage .
this truly is an unfortunate country , which has experienced frequent name changes .
Mr van Nistelrooij has already said the same : hence the call for this investment and incentives on Europe &apos;s part to expand it considerably over the coming years , possibly even by the mid-year budget evaluation .
these ‘ mad ’ men and women came to ask us to roll out the scheme in Europe , because they would thus feel more like citizens of this Europe , in which all too often they have been , and still are , discriminated against and deprived of their rights .
hence our vote against .
the question is and remains : is it to the consumer &apos;s benefit ?
this proposal is thus in all respects not ready for any decision to be taken on it , as a result of which I shall be voting against .
that seems to be working .
however , Mr Cohn-Bendit , we need to be careful not to plunder the elites of the developing world .
report Schmidt ( A5-0324 / 2001 ) :
we owe it to industry , to small and medium-sized enterprises and individual inventors to provide a simple , affordable Community patent which in turn will help EU innovation and competitiveness .
for the above reasons , I voted in favour of the aforementioned motion for a resolution .
Commissioner , thank you for your reply ; I am pleased to note that the Commission shares the Council &apos;s common position which , as you say , is consistent with the trend of events between the Madrid and Florence European Councils .
the rapporteur is repeating his old refrain with new words .
in the European Union at present , however , cogeneration is not yet being used to its full potential as a means of saving energy .
I note your remarks with interest , Commissioner , and am delighted to hear that the Commission takes this issue seriously , but your role as I see it seems to be confined to reminding Member States , requesting strong action and then requesting to be informed .
fiscal consolidation must be teamed with government investment and other collective spending if we want to create more jobs and avoid excessive socio-economic instability .
while following the Greens ’ energy strategy – and Mr Turmes is a Green – I have noticed that there is a hostile attitude to research into the use of fusion energy .
this has been a natural consequence of Mexico &apos;s commercial preference for other countries which are her partners in a free trade area , in this case as a member of NAFTA .
the Commission takes the view that tobacco producers must be offered new ways of diversifying into other crops or other sectors .
agreed !
as I have already explained during the ACP-EU Joint Assembly , I can assure you that it has always been my intention to share the results with you and everybody else as soon as it is possible , in order for everybody to have a comprehensive view of the issues at stake during the forthcoming negotiations .
I am not making this point by way of criticism , but only as an observation .
if we look at heading 1a concerning the Seventh Programme for R &amp; D , payments in 2009 were significantly smaller than in 2008 .
thank you for your attention .
can the Commission indicate the amounts and programmes in respect of which the Greek Government has requested an exemption from the n + 2 rule ?
it reads as follows : &quot; Hopes that true to the rules of social dialogue the Commission will continue to consult with the parties concerned . &quot;
in its resolution of 11 November 2010 , Parliament asked the Commission to introduce procedural , administrative and financial simplification measures into the current management of the Seventh Framework Programme , yet these measures have still not been addressed .
the constructive and steadfast support provided by Parliament for Croatia &apos;s accession process is an important signal .
new Member States have joined since then and this has not had any effect from the point of view of the debate we are holding on the Rules of Procedure : the Rules of Procedure do not change with each new accession .
this report unfortunately looks at sport through the lens of professional football .
Mr President , like you I am going to welcome the work carried out by our fellow Member , Mrs McKenna , on this Community framework for cooperation in the field of marine pollution . This should prove to be an instrument of particular interest , as is perfectly illustrated by the latest marine disaster to hit the coasts of France .
we need , in the ancient and mediaeval tradition of Europe , to go back to the natural order of the universe , i.e. to the Creation , and beyond that still further , to the Creator &apos; s intention .
well , I would like to dispute that at this stage renewable energy has any considerable impact on food prices .
this is one of the most dangerous aspects of the attacks on workers ’ rights and jeopardises the gains made in a struggle that has lasted over 100 years , affecting millions of workers and their families .
it is important to look at that , but we must take wider action to avoid ecological collapse .
over 100 million people do not have access to safe water .
I am thinking of active measures against corruption .
the new situation in Egypt should create the right environment to put these funds to maximum use and push forward the implementation of much more ambitious programmes than was possible in the past .
maternity leave after the birth of the child should be at least eight weeks .
I think that the EU ’ s action plans , in the framework of the new neighbourhood policy , must be linked more closely to the European aspirations that were very prominent in Ukraine .
the Community initiative for granting interest subsidies on loans was modest but welcome .
the Commission shares the fears expressed by Parliament on the expected cereal shortage in Bulgaria .
they must translate into action .
in addition to the EU ’ s traditional concerns as regards democratisation , respecting freedoms , complying with international standards , advocating an economic model in which free initiative is not to be confused with the absolute freedom of the few or with the freedom that varies according to who is in power , the EU is now discovering the concerns of most of its most recent new Members .
in addition the international community , including the EU , can assist , for example by lowering the cost of condoms and providing clean needles and essential drugs .
I am convinced that this is a transitional situation which will improve during this year .
the situation is also explained by the Asian and Russian crises , which also deprive the European Union of a potential market .
I think that a new mandate is desirable , bearing in mind , not least , the objectives and commitments entered into by the European Union in different international forums .
do we want to leave Turkey to make its own way or reject it ?
this will cultivate the credibility expected of Parliament .
Mr President , it is a fact that the countries of the south-eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East as a whole are an important field of action for the foreign relations of the European Union and the present Commission communication confirms this .
sixthly , advertisements for goods or services that can be purchased electronically must allow potential purchasers to verify the information put out .
I do not doubt their good intentions , but a directive would be too much of a good thing .
it is therefore not part of my report to this body for 2004 ; it is a report concerning OLAF that will be examined next year .
this agreement , intended to set limits on the excessive costs of calls and text messages when roaming , benefits the consumer , benefits communication between European countries and benefits a useful and positive Europe .
furthermore , we cannot ignore the matter of the current context of the whole region .
unfortunately developments so far seem to justify our misgivings , which has been proven for example by the fact that the Commission has not fulfilled its promises to increase the EU &apos;s environmental standards to the level of the standards in the new Member States during the transitional period agreed .
therefore , these statistics need to be adapted , and we are going to adapt them in line with demand for energy .
President Van Rompuy , as this is your first speech in the plenary session of the European Parliament , we agreed that it could be slightly longer .
a weak area in the report is the pursuit of a European labour market .
in our opinion , we will need , sooner or later , to change the fundamental objectives of the current enlargement process and European integration as a whole .
faced with the prospect of an enlarged EU with 25 Member States , a large majority in this Parliament is saying that we shall be unable to make decisions unless the veto is abolished .
women have obviously been hit very hard by the economic crisis and are more exposed to the risk of poverty , especially in the case of single-parent families .
so , why do we not try ?
such a conference could identify best practices and initiatives that could be launched both at Community and national level , and the European Parliament will be involved in its organisation .
the Commission is currently examining the concerns expressed by the Group .
take care , though , ladies and gentlemen : the temptation to attribute unpopular decisions to Brussels - what we are accustomed to refer to as Brussels - has already , in the past , caused immense damage , and it continues .
Mr President and Commissioner , we believe that today more than ever , the European agricultural model must be protected in order to shield national agricultural markets from international price fluctuations and give substance to the defence of models of production and use of the territory which are so characteristic of European agriculture .
my dear sir , I think you misunderstood me earlier .
secondly , deterrence , of which there was certainly too little in the case of Kosovo , because no common will was visible .
I would also like to point out that we want to support and do support everything said at the United Nations conferences which affects us , and I hold up Mrs Junker &apos;s excellent general report as proof of this .
that state of affairs , it seems , also applies to the courts which will hear the cases in Member States .
we need to increase this to 50 000 families .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all I should like to offer sincere thanks to the rapporteur for his excellent report .
in light of the Commission ’ s Comprehensive Monitoring Report on the readiness of Romania to accede to the European Union in 2007 , which notes the Commission ’ s concerns relating to Romania ’ s lack of progress in certain areas in the field of child protection , as well as in the disabled and mental health care system , could the Commission specify how much weight it attaches to these issues in its ongoing negotiations with the Romanian authorities ?
one final remark .
I think it an impertinence that you want to pay for this out of public funds !
Italy , for example , has more than half of the businesses in Latin America with offices in Mercosur countries .
I would like to thank Mr Maat , the rapporteur , for taking the exceptions into consideration .
the EU energy strategy advocated in this report , and which is advocated by the Commission in its various communications on the subject , is closely linked to the definition of a Union policy described in the Treaty of Lisbon : &apos; completion of the EU internal energy market &apos; .
introduction of the &quot; mixing zone ” concept - in whose area EQSs may be exceeded ;
so in answer to the first question , I can say that the Commission is studying the new definition of borders and may in the short term say whether the definition is consistent or not .
the Commission is also taking steps to improve cross-border cooperation inside the Union by meeting relevant authorities .
there is therefore nothing to prevent an agreement at this second reading .
we have to stop immediately making a distinction between external relations and our internal security , between cutting out the roots of extremism and counter-terrorism .
however , the European Commission has consistently sidelined energy efficiency as a flagship policy in favour of hammering the motor industry .
( DE ) Mr President , I would like to begin by expressing my sympathies to all those affected by this devastating situation .
however , such announcements are causing the greatest anxiety in countries such as Poland , because there is a real danger that the resources available for cohesion policy will be reduced , whereas cohesion policy is , in principle , one of the foundations of the European Union .
currently the Commission is discussing with Member States how much time is needed to finish these actions and the Commission will publish - I already have this commitment - these names as soon as it is legally possible , otherwise the Commission could be sued .
I do not know whether that applies already in some of the countries which wish to accede to the Union .
it is important that the European Parliament presses for corresponding agreements to be made for employees in other types of atypical employment . And it is good that attention is being drawn to the areas where the agreement could have been better .
( FR ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would first of all like to pay tribute to the report by my colleague Reinhard Rack .
Europe 2020 - new European Strategy for Jobs and Growth ( debate )
Mr President , I am speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group .
public health is thus really being taken for a ride and the food industry ’ s lobbying has won it the battle .
those farms are well run , they provide churches , schools and hospital treatment in those areas .
as the old saying goes , however : charity begins at home .
I agree with the rapporteur when he calls for an increase in the powers of Member States to act in their capacity as coastal States when faced with accident hazards or the threat of pollution .
there is an increasing number of petitions related to free movement , the judiciary and the internal market .
the Commission drafted an excellent paper for the Lahti Summit , and over lunch there we spent around three hours discussing the approach so thoroughly that President Barroso and I were able to speak for the group as a whole in the evening when we met President Putin .
Mr President , Commissioner , the EGTC cannot solve every problem , of course , and I realise - as we have heard - that a lot of Member States have yet to start using it .
as long as this schizophrenia continues , voting on moralising resolutions is pure hypocrisy and I shall have no part in it .
however , when it comes to the practical , as we have seen in the Balkans , the results are a disaster , an absolute disaster .
this morning in the budget we haggled over according the Philoxenia programme ECU 8m , ECU 4m or ECU zero .
what we could still do , if you want a concrete measure , would be to keep our delegations well informed and to train them well , so that they are able to respond very quickly , be on constant alert and make the most of any information they may receive .
( applause )
of course , this new legislation should be thoroughly assessed as to its necessity , its costs and benefits and its wider impact , but less regulation is not always better regulation .
three amendments - Amendments Nos 2 , 3 and 7 - tabled not by us but by the Green Group were rejected by a very large majority , with roughly 400 against and 115 for .
 
a civil war has been gradually developing there for more than 40 years .
a man died last week because he could not have simple surgery in our hospital system .
meetings are all very well , but it is the result that counts .
I therefore want more specific arguments .
but let me say the obvious to the African countries : you know what is happening in Zimbabwe is wrong .
thank you , Mrs Ojala , for your comment and we shall look into the problem you have raised .
Mr Galeote , although you chose to address the Socialist Group , which is very large , and my group is tiny , I am going to speak sincerely , on behalf of a very small group , but one that on vital issues has been involved , modestly , side by side with all our Spanish colleagues .
it is a mark of the Lomé culture that conditions are not just imposed on the contractual partners , but that efforts are made to ensure that the measures proposed are supported by the country concerned , in agreement with the governments and the population .
the reaction of France and the French Government was justified and proper , and our position should be equally resolute and severe .
it is not the result of one television programme !
this is something which we pay too little attention to in our structural and regional policies , and the Commission is one of the main culprits here .
I would like us to work together in the spirit of the founders of Europe .
the Commission has also identified a number of horizontal issues .
on the one hand , in order to combat gas emissions that are driving climate change , we promote the use of biofuel ( and have even set obligatory quotas for its use ) .
some of the measures stated in your various amendments are going in the same direction .
there is a justifiable fear that after the enlargement of the EU , the number of women in the next European Parliament will be lower than it is at present .
the EU is playing an active role in Arctic issues .
a great many of the key provisions of the Regulation under discussion result directly , or indirectly , from her personal commitment to putting in place a very strong framework to protect our citizens from the threat from TSEs and this is an objective I fully share and I want to join with Mr Phillip Whitehead in wishing Mrs Roth-Behrendt the very best for her stay in hospital over the next couple of days .
the euro has not kept its promise .
signals such as those sent out by Mr Sarkozy - that Turkey , regardless of what it does , will never join the European Union - certainly do not help .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission communication on a Community immigration policy with common standards and a common status for recognised asylum-seekers has provoked a much-needed debate and you deliberately arranged for an open debate at the outset , Commissioner Vitorino .
Vice-President of the Commission . - Mr President , I should like to thank the honourable Members very much for their comments .
I believe that this political choice is , without doubt , the right choice .
Mr President , first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Queiró , on compiling this comprehensive and detailed report , which I welcome .
the Bulgarian Government finds the absorption of funds to be a major task .
they deserve full recognition for having done so , and I hope you can give a positive answer to the question we have put to you in this House today .
it has not established evidence , it has merely provided a platform for anti-American bias .
I think sometimes we underestimate the amounts of courage and commitment which are required for aid workers working in these sort of circumstances .
there is a great deal to be done .
Mr Simitis and his friends are proud of all this .
the Irish peace process is at a critical juncture .
this should provide a unique opportunity to give a new impetus to a much needed common immigration and asylum policy .
Article 161 of the 1985 accession document establishes Spain &apos; s share of hake from the northern stock in Divisions Vb , VI , VII and VIIIab , that is to say the western waters including the Bay of Biscay , at 30 per cent .
the goal of the Community is on the one hand to ensure the uniform application of the law in this area and on the other hand to back effective policies for fighting discrimination and upholding equality in cases where the law is not being applied in a satisfactory manner .
Mr President , since this voting session is a continuation of the lunch-time voting session , would I be correct in thinking that the few roll-call votes in which we have participated this afternoon will count as part of our daily count , and that this has direct relevance to the earlier vote on whether we had a quorum or not ?
it is also clear that the necessary safeguards must be established to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals .
while registration should generally be on a first-come , first-served principle , we have nonetheless proposed that rightholders , who have prior rights in law and public policy , should have the opportunity to pre-register .
what has it done to make the Israeli leaders face up to their historical responsibilities ?
Madam President , I agree with the previous speakers that Mrs Fontaine has produced an excellent report .
Mr President , I believe this has been agreed by all political groups .
following the example of the Belgian Government , all the Member States should introduce the provisions of the European Union &apos;s code of conduct on arms exports into their national legislation .
Madam President , firstly , I wish to thank you for this discussion , which really has illustrated the importance of the roles we all have to play .
it means that the planning process which is already underway between Sweden and Norway can continue , which perhaps would not otherwise have been the case .
the amendment tabled by my group asks for producers to demonstrate by 2003 that these products are harmless , and I hope that this can be achieved .
we have heard nothing about Albania .
my second question is a special one concerning the protection of the great white shark .
innocent people too are at risk .
3 , subparagraph 2 , concerning the cancellation of contracts of employment .
I compliment Dr Barroso not only on the excellent work that he did during his first period of office , but also on his deserved re-appointment for a new term at the head of the European Commission .
he has stated that we must distinguish between extremists and the majority of citizens and that , in order to combat terrorism , without alienating Muslims and causing a genuine clash of civilisations , we need public diplomacy and we need to build bridges and tackle the roots of the problems , and that simply to use military and economic means is not sufficient .
closer to home , how corruption-free can the system be seen to be when Members , or their close relatives , of the European Parliament and other EU institutions , involved in making legislation , are at the same time members of boards of companies , or are stakeholders in companies which stand to make huge profits from such legislation ?
prevention can be achieved through public awareness - as the Commissioner mentioned - and thus all necessary preventive measures could be taken .
the EGF was set up in 2006 to provide practical support to workers made redundant either for reasons associated with the relocation of their companies or , following the 2009 amendment , on account of the economic crisis , in order to assist their reintegration into the labour market .
in almost all the Member States there is a glaring lack of childcare .
on 24 June elections are going to be held .
communication between the special committee and the Committee on Budgets should not be broken at Parliament &apos; s first reading , after which some time might pass until the matter is finally resolved .
a Europe in which the concept of responsible freedom does not cover solely the free movement of capital and in which citizens pool their abilities irrespective of their social status .
finally , in my view , it is very important for us to hear from the Commission what steps it intends to take with regard to digital television , so as to be able to lay down this one European standard as soon as possible .
if we do not , we will have American-styled practices on our hands , and I would not simply refer to President Bush , but also to the practice of candidates actually only accruing funds instead of pursuing politics .
tomorrow the Committee on External Economic Relations will meet , chaired by Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan .
in this respect , I agree with the fact that the European Union must consider establishing a system of own resources that allows us to prepare for enlargement without undermining the principles of solidarity and cohesion , two of the most fundamental ideas behind European Union integration .
.
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) I should like to say that , as regards the management of the Frontex Agency and the more general issue of immigration , the basic goals of the Portuguese Presidency are to combat illegal immigration more effectively and improve the adaptation , integration and quality of life of those working in our midst and contributing legally to our economic and social development .
- Before the vote :
following discussions and votes in committee , a compromise was found in this area to allow the southern Member States to use methyl bromide for longer in soil fumigation .
however , since the beginning of April , we have witnessed a situation involving a hunger strike begun by a journalist , Mr Ben Brik , which is causing a serious crisis of conscience and a violation of the association agreement by the Tunisian Government . It has not only forbidden Ben Brik from writing as correspondent for the French newspaper La Croix , but it has also taken away his passport and prevented him from using the telephone .
the main goal in the long term must be the reconversion of local industrial activities .
thanks are due not least to the rapporteurs for their good and cooperative approach to our work together .
in what has occurred in relation to this Directive over the past weeks and months , I see a successful path and a successful attempt to do that .
we also agree absolutely with the rapporteur when he asks the Commission to seal off the markets of all Member States against the products of illegal fishing , by adopting effective Community commercial and customs legislation .
it is not only non-smokers who think that is wrong .
I support the intention behind this Treaty change .
I hope that with today &apos;s vote , the European Parliament contributed at least a little to the conservation of fish stocks and a healthy marine environment , and also to reform of the common fisheries policy .
for this reason , we should endorse the resolution on recent attacks on Christian communities .
Mr President , in reply I shall say a few brief words about each of the reports , leaving until last a number of comments on the own-initiative report by Mr Crampton regarding the international fisheries agreements , which have been at the focus of this evening &apos;s debate , and to which all the speeches made have in any case referred .
consumers , who already make a significant contribution to waste management , must be supported and assisted in this task by retailers and product sellers .
the next century will probably see an evolution in the urban environment , both in terms of its form and its size .
creating a link between them to make them accessible means increasing the existing potential for innovation .
but we must also prepare our own people and explain how important the enlargement is and the moral commitment we all have to strengthen the union of democratic states .
clearly , the key figures required need to represent a challenge , but they must also always retain an adequate sense of proportion ; they always have to be realistic .
I think that the European Parliament , and particularly its Committee on Regional Policy , has risen to the occasion .
but national sovereignty must serve the interests of the citizen , in this case the protection of his rights and freedoms .
it would be to my great satisfaction if we could soon welcome another Hungarian community living outside their home country into the European Union .
at all phases and levels of decision-making the aim is to have a ) balanced participation of women and men and b ) a partnership which includes representatives of competent authorities and bodies in the field of equality between women and men .
the message emerging from the European Council is clear .
the Commission is asking the Council and Parliament to do so .
furthermore , the same government leaders who agree on this are , in Brussels , often those who are reluctant to actually implement the attendant legislation .
I think that tax systems are very national in character .
in short , the joint text lays down :
I reject any such attempt to influence us by any interest groups whatsoever .
on the other hand , it is true that a number of cases of disease transfer were reported recently in circumstances suggesting that inadequate hygiene was to blame .
the Committee on Women ’ s Rights and Gender Equality intends to organise a hearing on the subject next week .
I would like to insist that the Commission has another thorough look at the usefulness of the Community tourism programmes .
one concerns Nicaragua .
policy and legislation should make provision for e-commerce without creating unnecessary barriers .
the Council has – and will retain – the ultimate responsibility for the nuclear safety of our citizens .
one month from the European elections , that is a strong sign .
however , our committee is disappointed that this presentation is regionally based and does not contain accurate data which allow us to assess both women &apos;s access to Structural Funds and the impact of Community initiatives on promoting equal opportunities .
what makes the fight against money laundering so difficult is the fact that the techniques used in it differ in no way from those used by tax defaulters when they want to launder their illegal money .
from this it also follows that there may be a conflict of interests between the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg and the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg .
Member States &apos; governments are free , according to the Treaty , to nationalise , de-nationalise , privatise , expropriate or whatever .
the Council noted , too , Croatia &apos;s cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia , although it felt that further efforts were necessary .
despite your efforts , Commissioner , the planned framework decision on the matter has not yet been formally presented and , in its initial discussions , the Council has proved to be extremely divided over the need for and content of harmonised rights of defence .
other considerations are all given priority until regulation becomes unavoidable , and then the emphasis is on freedom for business , limiting costs and free competition .
I hope that we will have a good discussion and I can assure you that the Danish Presidency will take care to include the points of view put forward today in its further deliberations .
I think this agreement is ambitious as well as realistic .
and then we complain that voter turnout falls further with every new election .
we do , of course , also ask for the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan , which as NATO itself acknowledges week after week , is causing innocent civilian deaths .
however , if there were any change I would communicate it to you by the deadline for submitting nominations , which is at 4.45 p.m.
I have not previously had reason to agree with Mr Delors , but in this case I must say that , unfortunately , he is right to be concerned .
in fact , the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection has already tabled various amendments , most of which have subsequently been accepted by the Committee on Agriculture . In particular , I would call attention to those amendments whose recitals refer to the fact that traditional farming has had a major adverse impact on the environment and also on consumer health , and the fact that it is necessary today - an extremely important amendment , this one - to accept that the Common Agricultural Policy will gradually have to be realigned towards more ecological production of plant and animal products .
therefore as far as I am concerned , I am firmly opposed to anything that runs counter to this basic biblical principle .
while awaiting the results of this summit , our institutional cooperation with Ukraine will be intensified and stepped up .
we take the view that high standards of protection can only be achieved by environmentally sound regulation and harmonization .
in order to guarantee the safety , quality and efficiency of transport on our continent - including both passenger transport and freight - we need to give absolute priority , once and for all , to transport and in particular to rail transport , not to mention short sea shipping and maritime cabotage .
the Commission therefore proposes to focus Community activities and projects on the reduction of bottlenecks .
we need to encourage our Parliament to look at these issues in technical detail in the future so that we have equality and solidarity between the sexes .
there have been signs that the government intends to pay employees in the industries concerned the salaries that have remained outstanding .
I will deal with the amendment tabled by the Greens tomorrow .
Mr President , I should like to begin by saying that I cannot agree with the previous speaker .
naturally , this was a bitter pill to swallow , especially for those Member States who have given this framework decision their strong support .
then the compromise on the age of retirement does not seem to be worthy either .
and we are trying to ensure that food is comprehensively labelled .
in writing . - ( ES ) I voted in favour of the report on effectiveness although I do not agree with all of it .
ahead of the Commission &apos;s Consultation Forum , I should like the Commission to listen to the experts when considering the effects of this directive on Ireland .
Mr President , I would , of course , like to join my fellow Members in voicing our deep sorrow and our solidarity with the people who have been seriously affected by this disaster , which is unprecedented in terms of its scale and its duration .
in the Commission &apos; s view this proposal will make a significant contribution to improving energy efficiency and therefore to controlling demand , which the Green Paper identifies as crucial to assuring a reliable supply .
the negotiations at the UN &apos;s preparatory meeting in New York did not lead to binding agreements , which is why the next and last chance for the global negotiations will be at the end of May in Bali .
despite quite rightly calling for budgetary rigour within the Member States , the Council thinks it can apply this in a devious way to the Union &apos;s budget , which is the only instrument for consolidating and explaining to our citizens the advantages of economic , monetary , and perhaps soon political union in Europe .
the fact of the matter is that some in our Union - mainly but not only among the new members - feel they are discriminated against .
this will have to change , not only here in Parliament but elsewhere too , and particularly in the Council .
there are national and European authorities that monitor compliance with those regulations .
I call on you to support us in this undertaking and to sign this text as soon as possible .
Mr President , I rise simply to report to the House the good news that last night the President of Pakistan , who was our guest a few weeks ago , has commuted the death sentence on my constituent Mirza-Tahir Hussain , who had been on death row for 18 years but is widely regarded to be innocent of the charges against him .
in the first place as regards the subject-matter , because only after the real health situation in Europe is known - which will be by putting all the data on a uniform basis , checking their reliability and transmitting them through a computer network - will it be possible to achieve a Community citizens &apos; health monitoring system , to include factors affecting their health , to make comparisons of health in the various Member States and to bolster the Member States &apos; health policies .
childcare is one of the core issues .
that mechanism can be activated by the Council following an initiative from the Member State which is in difficulty or following an initiative from the Commission .
if the Irish Government , which is finding it difficult to refinance itself on the markets , wishes to access loans from the European Financial Stability Mechanism and the European Financial Stability Fund , it will have to meet requirements for social and fiscal change , even though these areas come under subsidiarity .
yet even this dismal economic justification for culling on such a scale does not stand up .
the Vlaams Belang is now the biggest political party in Flanders .
internally , euro area governments will have to act together to contain the effects of the economic crisis and invest in the structural bases of the economy to build a bridge to the post-crisis world .
it - I refer here to consultation - is an exercise in relation to which there are , of course , several possibilities .
furthermore , there is no reason why the motto &apos; equal pay for equal work &apos; , which is so often and correctly applied , should not also apply to Members of the European Parliament .
and they are so surprised at this , as if it were the consequence of regrettable natural disasters or tsunamis .
what I mean is that the prospect of short-term gains should not induce us to put our future in hock to this extent .
thank you .
when I received Dr Saeed Jalili , the Iranian chief negotiator , last week , I reminded him of our principled position .
the unwillingness of the Commission is , however , with apologies to the Commissioner , apparent to everyone .
Mr President , it would seem from today &apos;s speeches that there is wide support for the rationale underlying the regulation , which can be described as follows . First of all , there is a basic coherence between competition policy and employment policy , as Mr Karas quite rightly pointed out .
it is appropriate to remove the out-of-date proposals concerning management by kilowatt days , to adapt the minimum quantities concerning control arrangements according to the measures set up for 2005 , to establish tolerance margins and conversion factors consistent with those in the Northern hake recovery plan , and I can agree with the deletion of obsolete provisions concerning effort messages .
an assembly must be peaceful ; it has to be held under certain conditions which do not threaten public order .
I am surprised at the civil servants &apos; and ministers &apos; attitude .
lastly , and to sum up , Madam President , I would nevertheless like to say to those who have criticised the concept of impartiality , as they may rightfully do so , of course , that by maintaining a position of equal distance between both parties does not mean we believe that their circumstances are identical .
what is needed is intercultural learning and extracurricular education accompanied by opportunities for service and study abroad for longer periods .
in other words , we have never agreed with the idea of certification .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , you have before you a unanimous resolution by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to appoint Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell as a member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank and to support this recommendation .
there is also a clause allowing performers to undo buy-out contracts once their producers cease to sell their recorded performances .
but they cannot be the only reason .
anyone who has taken part in citizens &apos; debates within the framework of the pre-Laeken consultation , or has taken the trouble to listen to the messages that came to light recently in the large demonstrations that took place in Brussels , will have in mind those urgent demands which are practically absent from the Convention &apos; s agenda as defined by the Laeken Declaration .
I think it is quite something that the Member States apparently feel no need to react to what the European Parliament has to say about your report .
one question that is important to deal with here in Parliament , and that will definitely be something that affects the linguistic diversity within the EU , is also whether we will guarantee equality between small and medium-sized enterprises that operate in all parts of our Union .
Mr Purvis is a living example of this : just by drawing up his report on biotechnology he has become younger , if that is possible , for he is always youthful .
tension between the individual states and Europe stems from this and is causing problems , and this is also increasing Europe &apos;s democratic deficit , which is only set to get worse in the absence of a coordinated policy on immigration ; it is heightening the impression that the self-interests of states prevail over the greater good .
having a professional security service enables that to happen .
our experience to date with the single currency has been a good one ; it is stable and it and the dollar are the most important currencies in the world , the ones on which all else depends , but the strength of a currency depends not only on the independence of the central bank and on price stability ; it also , and in particular , depends on the government ’ s financial and budgetary policies .
this is obvious to everyone who feels affection for this painfully acquired child of European unity .
this does not only mean that we shall improve the quality of lawmaking , it also means that we shall say no much more often in future .
for example , we took quite a long time over the subject of pluralism and concentration of media .
it has also been a matter of concern for me from the outset to promote the dialogue between Parliament , the Council and the Commission .
written declarations for entry in the register ( Rule 116 ) : see Minutes
I feel like telling the people affected that Parliament has done its homework but that the other two key players are neglecting their responsibilities .
it is unfounded because , by definition , the repayable loans are repaid .
there have even been forced incidents of circumcision .
.
first , we learned something positive : that consumers in Europe enjoy vigorous competition in the car sales market .
it is likely that one of these will be genuine and the others superfluous .
however , the Committee lists further causes such as poverty , frivolous bidding procedures , giveaway prices for subcontractors , inflexible employment legislation and poor administrative practice , as well as a clear decline in the perception of undeclared work as something illegal and illicit .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am very pleased that the action programme on drug dependence is the subject of discussion in the House today .
if we act decisively , the best is yet to come .
in particular in the strategy for preventing and restoring disasters ( anti-flood protection , reinforcement against earthquakes ) and relieving victims , the policy of the Greek Government presents criminal shortcomings .
we now have 500 typical PDO and PGI products registered at European level , and I think there ought to be special ambassadors to promote the European way of producing and consuming worldwide , and to be the means of supporting new promotional measures at international level .
this was made a factor in Turkey &apos;s own EU candidacy – some might think wrongly so .
the third , and main conclusion concerns the imbalance between the speed of the crisis and the slowness of response times .
the many products involved are used as packaging , cosmetics , bathing accessories and , unfortunately , toys .
the report &apos; s proposals even consider the idea that improving the institutional workings of the Union will require major adjustments to the balance of established power which , without endangering the workings of these bodies , guarantee the full participation of all Member States .
we should not hide behind a possible review of the Convention of Vienna .
however , there were also reports in which events were played down .
we would like instead to insert the words : ‘ which should enter into force as soon as possible ’ .
not only will the overall population of the European Union grow old ; there will also be a shortage of people of a productive age .
they can cause side effects as they have a negative impact on health and they lead to the commercialisation of the human body .
this has led me to refrain from withdrawing the amendment , which I would prefer us to vote on today .
it is also inconsistent with the reforms that began some years ago in the external relations sector of the Commission .
last December , it was also agreed that the process of appointment of the future Commission , in particular the designation of its president , will be initiated without delay after the European Parliament elections of June 2009 .
( NL ) Madam President , the basis of many of the current developments was laid down as far back as hundreds of years ago .
despite the fact that six months have already passed since the first presentation , it is impossible to find a brochure or even any kind of publication on the subject , let alone in the national languages .
I am happy to say that , in my opinion , the proposal for a Directive on the promotion of cogeneration , which we are discussing , conforms to the requirements and furthermore it provides a response at a time when we are talking about integration of the European energy market and in particular the electricity market .
the discussions about appointments over the last few days lead me to fear that we are not looking for the best , European solutions , but for the easiest solutions for the Member States and the political parties .
it is up to them to continue to make good use of those funds .
it is indicative of the violence of the regime that prevails in the occupied areas that among a population of 160 , 000 , approximately 35 , 000 are soldiers or security forces , in other words one in five of the citizens , as the President , Mrs Green told us , is under arms .
in fact , European Innovation Partnerships are an instrument for creating synergies between already existing programmes at European , national and regional levels .
in my opinion , we should be bolting the door against Brussels &apos; creeping desire for ever more centralisation .
it means that to be adopted European legislation now has to pass two hurdles , two tests as to the quality and the acceptability of such legislation .
consequently , the overall result of the negotiations can be considered a success for Parliament , but also for economic and social policy .
that is a success also for you , Mr President , and I would like to offer you my warm congratulations .
the programme &apos;s &apos; priorities for action &apos; cover a wide variety of spheres involving consumers &apos; interests , but , I repeat , they are vague and imprecise , like almost everything else the Commission has presented recently .
in the case of ski instructors , where the issue of safety is at stake , they are allowed to impose aptitude tests .
the exclusion of these services is a key element of the text and a guarantee for the citizens that the European social model will be protected .
in fact , two areas need to be distinguished as regards relocations , those taking place within the Union and those taking place in the rest of the world .
the Serbian police in Kosovo are armed to the hilt .
we have achieved monetary union .
for reasons to do with the general interest , health , morality and security , these services need to be regulated and controlled .
( SK ) Mr President , we are talking about Roma integration issues .
our new and former colleague Martin Kastler has now arrived too .
a 20-year moratorium will send a clear signal that international trade is banned , it would suppress demand , lower prices and remove incentives for buying and stockpiling ivory .
Mr President , I must begin by gently drawing attention to what we said in 2001 in the report for which I was responsible . We know that this is a major problem .
I should like to make another formal comment . There is an Amendment No 7 which concerns the entry into force of the programme by 1 January next year , since the date of 1 January this year is now obsolete .
I suggest that will be inoperable and unenforceable .
I would call upon everyone to vote against the compromise , for where would the unemployed port workers go ?
it was the first time that European and Arab political leaders had expressed a united position on this crisis .
one comment : the Union strategy and policy in terms of energy for Northern Europe are very well documented .
Mr President , it is understandable that Europeans and Americans sometimes have different views on major international issues , but that must not hold back our commitment to try to act together , and I shall give you an example that I think demonstrates this clearly : the Monterrey Conference .
fortunately , they are indeed doing so , for example , by lifting the immunity of the Italian Prime Minister .
the democratic forces in Chechnya need to be identified and an attempt made to initiate a dialogue , because negotiation is the only possible way forward .
furthermore , the amendments I tabled contain the suggestion that , owing to a lack of time , the list the Committee on Budgets has decided upon , could be finalised next year .
I would like an assurance that we shall not have a repetition of this in the future .
finally , in relation to the Charter of Fundamental Rights , the citizens of Europe need to have a vision of citizenship .
since the bulldozers moved in it has become impossible to move around the field without treading on fragments of human bones and remains , shreds of military uniform and military equipment .
the debate is closed .
for this reason , it is high time for us finally to disconnect from the grid the old nuclear power stations and those that are at risk of earthquakes and , in the long-term , to get out of nuclear power . We need stress tests , Mr Oettinger !
I hope that , with the emphases we will be placing during the vote , we will manage to make the social agenda more practical .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the employment summit will be the yardstick for the social profile of Europe .
I hope that the approach of minimum harmonisation that has been chosen does not risk diluting the whole project .
may I first express my thanks for all the work that has taken place in the different committees in relation to this proposal for a regulation on GM food and feed and also to thank the rapporteurs for their hard work - also the Commission staff in both DGs , who have worked hard over the last couple of years to bring forward this proposal .
given that average income in the Member States that joined the European Union in 2004 and 2007 is relatively low , the proposed increase in excise duty is too great .
on the other hand , I cannot make a judgement on the third . I will therefore say that if what Mr Pompidou is proposing conforms to the original Danish text , i.e. reads the same as the wording of the original text , I can also agree with his third oral amendment .
it does not concern the Minutes , but relates to something else .
I shall confine myself to addressing two aspects of it .
to this end the regulation which we are debating at the moment in Parliament is very useful , since from this assessment we can reach conclusions which will allow us to determine the position we must take .
composition of committees and delegations : see Minutes
when I listen to some very critical speakers from Anglo-Saxon countries , I remember that it was precisely from such countries that , over the last few months , a particularly large number of cries for help came to overcome the financial crisis together .
by way of concrete example , we could juxtapose comparable countries , for example South versus North Korea , or the Asian tigers versus the South-Asian countries .
the committee is initiating the procedure during this legislative term .
there is no doubt , of course , that the accident at Fukushima was a catastrophe .
the idea was to lead us towards a greater civilisation in which we were united in the dignity of equals , and it was through dialogue that this was to be achieved .
the risk , in permitting maximum transparency , is that we will have sterile debates insofar as MEPs will be afraid to speak openly on sensitive issues .
the Commission can generally accept the amendments tabled by your rapporteur .
close dialogue with the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is essential , as is better use of the resources allocated to pre-accession aid .
 
we therefore need to act quickly to implement this programme soon , so that we do not disadvantage the cultural organisations on the ground , which rely on this funding and which have been waiting for months for a decision to be taken .
unfortunately the report of the Committee on Transport has taken a step backwards compared with the Commission &apos;s balanced compromise and will not even consider restricted liberalization , in spite of the favourable experience in the Netherlands and Sweden in this field .
in Europe there are unitary states , nation states and also multinational states - states made up of several nations with their own languages .
Mr President , I think that we all remember various resolutions from Parliament against the death penalty , which led to an increase in recent years in the countries who have abolished the death penalty , or at least in those who have had a practical moratorium , in which executions have not taken place in recent years .
both sides of this equation have to be considered .
we should do the same .
this obviously contradicts the principles and objectives of the EC Treaty , Title 4 of which refers to asylum policy as an important means of establishing an area of peace , security and justice .
we need real action , realistic action , and that must start next week with our climate change package .
a glance at our world today shows a very bleak picture : from the Bahá &apos;i in Iran to Copts in Egypt , from the use of blasphemy laws in Pakistan to the attacks on Christians or places of worship in Iraq and Nigeria .
it is a perfectly good idea to make the use of rapid diagnostic tests more widespread . They will be a significant component of BSE monitoring at Community level .
in this way the EU will increase its powers , even though the Member States have not legally bestowed them .
my group has been doing this for years ; this is something altogether different from brushing problems under the carpet .
it is a wage battle - a wage competition . This wage competition is exerting enormous pressure on our neighbouring European countries , on European trade unions and on European workers .
the latter is dependent on the goodwill of the company in actually deleting his or her name .
the Scottish farmers are very worried .
for some reason , a lot of it comes in Spanish from one particular sender .
we also consider joint liability of the manufacturer and the seller to be fundamental , and this really must be included in this directive . Of course it is also essential that the period of obligation to notify a fault is not reduced , so that the rights of the buyer and the consumer in this area are not restricted .
a law came into force at the beginning of this year in Finland under which the police or a court can impose a restraining order on a person who has behaved violently .
you say they are not sanctions .
a pluralist dialogue always leads to less tension and benefits freedom of religion and society as a whole .
we very much need the Community dimension as well .
different regions have quite different problems in terms of income levels , geographical location , migration , etc . However , we need to remember what my Polish fellow Members , Mrs Staniszewska , Mr Podkański and Mr Zapałowski said , about funds tending to accumulate in the centres of the regions .
in the interests of the Koreans themselves , the international community must no longer tolerate this .
success on this scale reflects the efforts we have all made - that you have made - to provide information and raise awareness .
finally , I would stress that we have been asking the Council and the Commission since July to take forceful action to secure the release of the 3 000 Kosovar prisoners and Mrs Brovina , Mr Jurti and Mr Hoti .
also a joint approach to the problems of climate change will substantially enhance the chances of solving these problems .
particularly the French Government springs to mind , now that the deadline of 3 October is drawing nearer .
last but not least , there are also challenges concerning health and epidemics , as well as fighting obesity , cardiovascular diseases and the growing occurrence of all types of cancer .
unfortunately , Russia , unlike more than 100 States , has not yet kept its promise to ratify the Protocol .
it is not a smokescreen , as has been suggested , to cover some political problems .
healthy feed is a precondition for healthy animals and thereby also for healthy foodstuffs .
it has to be said that the strategy proposed by the High Level Group on the textile sector provides for a most appropriate course of action .
if , today , you travel through this beautiful tropical country , with its impressive stone buildings that testify to the antiquity of its culture , then , wherever you go , you still come face to face with the physical and mental damage done to a tormented people , who , first , were terrorised by the Khmer Rouge , and then put under the yoke by their Vietnamese liberators , finally achieving a small measure of normality under the UN mandate .
I think a separate comment has to be made on the wording with regard to the return of national cultural goods .
even from the statements that Mrs Angelilli has made , it is clear that it could have been debated at other times and that it still can be debated at some other time , but not now as a matter of urgency .
ladies and gentlemen , I welcome the outcome of the European Council Spring Summit where the focus was on progress on the Lisbon Strategy and on launching the new cycle of the renewed Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs ( 2008-2010 ) .
I believe that the report is important ; the credibility and solvency of Médecins sans Frontières organisation are proven and for all of these reasons Parliament has the duty to take action to defend these two officials of that organisation .
my party is against the parochial approaches demonstrated by some Member States during last week &apos;s Council Summit .
European leaders &apos; main concern must be to preserve existing jobs and create other new ones to allow European citizens to make a decent living .
I support the idea that Romania should be able to join the EU , but I do not believe at this point in time either that they are really ready for membership or that the Union is really ready to receive them .
this time the protests and persecution intensified following a 500 % rise in the cost of fuel due to the government withdrawing its subsidy .
that is why , along with Community measures , we must develop lasting international standards .
I would like to underline once again that it is good that we have found clear regulations for the local and regional authorities , and even for churches , that reflect their interests .
Madam President , I would like to give particular thanks to the rapporteur Mr Evans for the quality of his report , a quality that has been evident at every stage and which highlights the important objectives of the programme we are debating today .
I am a farmer who farmed through the BSE crisis in the UK .
however , she has not been here for a few years and during this time we have had the Council on Thursday afternoons .
Mr President , I am indeed privileged today to present this report to Parliament . It is one of the first reports from the Development Committee under the codecision procedure .
President Prodi has spoken of a single cycle of economic policy coordination - I am referring to point 2.3 , b4 ) - and , indeed , only a single cycle is needed because the objectives laid down in the Stability Pact and the broad economic policy guidelines must coincide with those of the real economy , in other words the labour market and , above all , welfare .
recycling for the sake of recycling itself is something we have no need of ; it must mean a genuine saving .
indeed , security was the raison d &apos;être for what has become the European Union today .
the law of the Czech Republic is traditionally based on the criminal liability only of natural persons .
what is more , public deficits have never ever created jobs ; if they had , we would have known about it and seen proof of it .
the EGF has already been used in the past by other EU countries , particularly Portugal and Spain , so we should now grant this aid to Lithuania .
I think that the fundamental explanation lies in two figures : between 1991 and 1996 public debt went up from 56 % to 73.5 % of GDP .
if we have to follow the legal investigation to its ultimate conclusion , I want to see that happen - but I want to see my farmers protected , and I do not want to see them sold down the river .
that is why we have also submitted proposals to that effect .
we do support an outlook that stresses the social consequences of adopting policies of dismantling instruments for the sake of the organization .
the adoption of the regulation means that , in Denmark , we cannot prohibit substances that we already know to be carcinogens , hormone disrupters or allergens , as this would be seen as a barrier to the free movement of goods , which is precisely what the legislation is intended to ensure .
I would have very much liked to have seen the conference also discuss restricting the use of basic resources , the necessity of biodiversity for the natural regulation of the climate and population growth - a subject that all of the politicians of the world are shutting their eyes to , because in only a few years &apos; time , the planet will have to feed around 10 billion people .
our proposal therefore is to limit the burden of declaration by eliminating unnecessary data , such as the means of transport , and optional data , to limit the number of small and medium-sized companies required to supply detailed statistical data , and to simplify the use of the combined nomenclature , while preserving a single nomenclature for intra-Community trade and trade with third countries . We also propose establishing a partnership with national administrations and the representatives at European level of the suppliers and users of statistical information , as well as preserving , within the framework of this partnership , a sufficient time limit for the provision of information , in order to meet the special requirements of certain sectors , such as the wine sector which I illustrated .
I will bet that future agreements will have more substance .
A5-0057 / 1999 by Mr Gebhardt , on behalf of the Committee on Citizen &apos; s Freedoms and Rights , on the proposal for a Council Regulation ( EC ) on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgements in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility of joint children &#91; COM ( 99 ) 220 - C5 ­ 0045 / 1999 - 1999 / 0110 ( CNS ) &#93; .
finally , I must mention that the ecological balance in the Baltic has not been studied .
golf courses do not qualify
Madam President , they say , where I come from , &apos; it &apos; s three times for a Welshman &apos; , and three times , as I think you will discover in the course of that debate , I signified my desire to respond very briefly to what has been an excellent , and on several occasions , a moving debate .
there is nothing for it : we must take the decision to provide Europe with the best centres of excellence in the world , for , otherwise , our children will lose enthusiasm for research and innovation .
I therefore urge the Commission to submit at the earliest possible opportunity an impact assessment of the effects of the banana trade agreements on banana-producing developing countries and the European outermost regions until 2020 , so that we can appraise these countries &apos; difficulties and act accordingly and , if necessary , adjust and strengthen the Programme of Options Specifically Relating to Remoteness and Insularity .
we also want to promote Leonardo-type apprenticeship programmes at European level .
Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to present briefly the report on the urban dimension of cohesion policy .
it must be made clear that it is not the Commission which gives undertakings on behalf of the EU but the Council acting as the representative of the Member States .
it wants to take over relations with Eurocontrol from Member States , bringing it closer to achieving its ambition to be what Monnet described as a European government .
you claim that no single country is asking for vaccination , but no single minister dares ask at this moment when a true European discussion will be held on this subject .
we are also willing to make distinctions for meat prepared in different ways . For example , it is not necessary to make a precise distinction for casserole meat , since as I see it is enough to know if you are buying veal or beef casserole meat .
therefore , the concerns and ideas put forward by citizens must be taken into consideration by the EU institutions .
this is why I believe that Europe alone can and must intervene effectively with binding acts to preserve these precious areas which , each year , are in danger of going up in smoke and which really are the heritage of us all , because it is true that fires are breaking out more and more frequently in southern Europe , and even when it is only a tiny part of this southern Europe that is burning , in reality , it is the whole of Europe that is going up in flames .
I have instructed the services of our House , as a mark of respect , to fly the Spanish and European flags at half-mast .
my big fear tonight is that we will conclude that Alstom may survive and get the support of the European Union .
first , we recommend the establishment of an ad hoc international criminal tribunal .
in my view this is of great importance , since the Commission &apos;s document appears to be the chosen option , a development of the 92 reform approach .
the Commission will shortly propose the standby duties to the Council .
there has been no division between the old and the new Europe .
among other things , this means granting official papers to those who are denied them wherever in the European Union they may be .
the problem is the other species in the Mediterranean .
however , in the mean time and in the long run , we hope to find ways and explore the possibilities of how we can use or amend in that respect European legislation so that we have the possibility of classifying ETS as such as a carcinogen .
for example , the use of a new category of staff , namely contract staff , however useful it may be , must not lead to the abuse of this formula , because that would run the risk of weakening recruitment conditions and would undermine the workings of our institutions .
I wonder : what kind of industrial policy do we want for Europe ?
I have already said in this House - quoting an illustrious colleague of mine - that the future cannot be imposed on individuals or peoples without their support and that there can be no individual dignity unless every man and woman is able to play a part in determining their future as a society .
that is why I am very pleased , Commissioner , that you also mentioned this principle explicitly in your introductory remarks and expressed your support for it .
even though I value the idea of a structured dialogue , I wonder how it will be possible for this to take place with the regime in question .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of the Federal Minister , Mr Tiefensee , who is unfortunately unable to be with us due to an important appointment , I would like to express my gratitude for this opportunity to address you all today .
this stipulates that a Member State , regardless of the protocol &apos;s basic principle , always has the right ultimately to decide for itself whether or not an asylum application shall be examined .
the Commission &apos;s communication makes no direct mention of recycling .
compensation should be limited solely to the Natura 2000 areas and exclude non-profit-making activities , such as leisure pastimes , from professional activities .
what is the Council &apos;s overall view of this criminal act by European multinational companies and what is the level of EU funding for these companies operating in Latin America ?
as the honourable Member pointed out , on 5 June 2001 the Council adopted a recommendation asking the Member States to curb the production of alcoholic drinks aimed at children and adolescents , and advertising targeted at young people for this type of drink .
- Mr President , I want to raise a voice of concern and caution in this frenzied debate about climate change , particularly as it could affect food production .
we see that combined efforts are giving results .
the proposal from the Commission on which we are voting today is aimed at adapting European legislation to bring it up to date with the most recent scientific , technical and technological developments .
reform means increasing deconcentration and grouping together a certain number of delegations which are fewer in number but better equipped administratively and extended by branch offices with minimum representation .
the emphasis being placed on wind energy , cooperation with third countries and emissions trading schemes is a positive development .
the Commission is being asked , however , to draft within one year an announcement on the creation of a common asylum procedure and on a common status for those granted asylum throughout the Union .
however , I must point out a shortcoming , the gravity of which is underlined by the events in the Balkans .
Madam President , I would have liked Mr Ahtisaari to have found a solution that had the approval of the two parties in question : Serbia and Kosovo .
that is why the Commission has proposed that a tribunal to judge litigation in the case of intellectual property be set up , and the logical place for that tribunal to exist is in Luxembourg .
confusion and Malthusianism are running the show .
the EU 2020 strategy itself , together with its principal instrument , the Social Fund , will have to take account of the fact that the only employment and training policies that can make the outlay of European funds sustainable are those which are necessarily targeted at meeting local needs and strengthening and sustaining small and medium-sized enterprises as the cornerstone of the European economy .
before the end of the year , I will present a proposal on safety on ferries , although we know what happened in the case of the Samina Express : they were watching football .
BSE is a degenerative disease which does not cause sudden death anyway .
in this area too , it would be better to give greater consideration straight away to alternative means of protection other than asylum .
it should be realised that the Committee on Budgetary Control addresses such issues because there are special reports by the Court of Auditors and these are becoming more numerous .
I see the contrary , however : we are facing an attempt to get the substance of the constitutional treaty adopted through the back door by renaming the project &apos; reform treaty &apos; and excluding the possibility of referendums .
ten years ago , I could not have imagined that there would be television programmes in Kurdish .
harmonising electoral systems for the European election could actually be detrimental to the very fair and equitable system that we have in Ireland , and most people in this Parliament are probably totally unaware of that .
I recall a tragic accident in Helsinki a few weeks ago in which a wheel that had come off a lorry killed a small child .
in writing . - ( LV ) European farmers play an important role in supplying food to more than 500 million people in Europe and in securing food supply in the world as a whole .
it is not possible to escape from this situation by willpower alone , or through one &apos;s own decisions .
at the moment , everyone in Kosovo still thinks that independence will solve everything .
I feel that , if this debate were to send out these sorts of signals , we would be able genuinely to start building the framework for a new European agriculture structure based on young people which , most importantly , would certainly not mean abandoning and forgetting those who are seeking possible alternatives in the new environmental and multifunctionality opportunities .
we can take this opportunity only if we ourselves become stronger and more influential , and therefore this policy goes in the right direction .
the question is ...
this Commission thinks this does not fairly represent the actual situation .
the first point of clarification , which defines all the others , is the primacy of Community law as opposed to national law .
we should also endeavour to find some way of ensuring that VAT falls under the category of eligible expenditure .
as is well known , investment in infrastructure produces higher returns through Keynes &apos;s multiplier , greater competitiveness , and more economic and social cohesion in the north , south , east and west .
the debate is closed .
furthermore , NGOs are currently proposing to advance the culture of peace through dialogue and cooperation between individuals and communities of diverse religions and beliefs through a UN Decade of Interreligious Dialogue and Cooperation for Peace , possibly to run from 2011 to 2020 .
with regard to the other issues , particularly the issue of VAT , I believe that they have already been thoroughly discussed previously .
these exceptional circumstances may be justified in individual cases , enabling increased flexibility in how projects and programmes are implemented .
I should like to note that at the time , the Committee of Independent Experts made a few suggestions in reaction to the dismissal of the Santer Commission in order to work faster and to move away from multi-stage plans .
Mr President , I wonder how often we want to continue going through the Zimbabwe ritual here in the topical and urgent debate process .
we therefore voted in favour of maintaining direct aid to income in the tobacco production sector within the European Union , thereby guaranteeing greater compliance with Community preference , in order to reduce the share of American multinationals in the tobacco consumption market and to protect the interests of Portuguese farmers , without public health being endangered .
my second question is : what do you intend to do so that justice is dispensed for the benefit of victims and their relatives within the framework of this vision , so that we can use this vision to achieve accident prevention ?
of course , globalisation is not a panacea for all evils .
on the contrary , I believe that this solution to the post question will make life considerably more difficult , and most particularly for the employees .
thank you Mr President , President-in-Office of the Council , and Commissioner , for the essential clarification that you have just given us , which shows the seriousness of the Commission &apos;s work .
Madam President , I was supposed to be making a further speech in just a moment , so I would like to request another 10 seconds this time round , if I may , and then I shall not get up a second time .
since 1993 , 50 % of the Cambodian forest has been destroyed with the complicity of a corrupt government .
that is not freedom : that is being answerable for using a service that is intended to free you .
for this reason , may I ask the House to support Amendment 71 in tomorrow ’ s plenary vote .
( PT ) My position on the Iraqi conflict is clearly expressed in the speech I gave in yesterday &apos;s plenary sitting .
to make mistakes will be catastrophic not just for the existing Member States but also for the countries wishing to join .
if I may , however , I should like to make a number of general comments .
secondly , institutional reform got short shrift both in your speech today and also in your written programme .
the Commission welcomes Parliament &apos;s response to this report .
this is an issue that I regard as being particularly important .
it is the expression of the lives of individuals , groups and peoples .
this morning , Parliament is also proposing an ambitious report on biomass and biofuels , which are important elements in energy independence for the EU and in the fight against climate change .
all of them are achieving higher returns than us , while we are wallowing in chronic recession .
we are not concerned with the harshness or otherwise of the sentence that could be handed down .
we support the measures drawn up , measures which are still scarce and difficult to apply , but which will continue to increase the world &apos; s awareness of responsible fishing and trade and make such awareness more effective .
.
we must convince our fellow citizens that enlargement will bring solutions , not problems .
written statements ( Rule 142 )
as has been said many times already , these rights are crucial to enable women to take responsibility for their own and thus their families &apos; lives .
if we cast our minds back just one month , to 1 January of this year , and look at what has happened in the world over the intervening thirty days , it is clear that it may be genuinely useful for us to reflect here in this Parliament ; we should reflect on the European Union ’ s capacity for politics , the European Union ’ s capacity for international politics and the obligation facing all of us .
it just goes to show that there are even difficulties on the cooperation front sometimes , which are partly structural in nature .
what is this construction of the area of freedom , security and justice about ?
the Commission considers that minimum prices for lawyers ’ services are a restriction on the freedom to provide services because they neutralise the competitive advantage of service providers from other Member States .
indeed , the introduction of the euro has entailed an institutional separation between monetary policy decision making , which is addressed to the euro area as a whole , and the exercise of supervisory tasks , which relates to domestic institutions and markets .
however , as in the case of tobacco products , we also know that drinking alcohol and adopting the habit of drinking begins at a young age , particularly because of the example shown by adults and the positive image it is given in advertisements .
they will therefore meet this need for information and the need to reassure public opinion , namely the general public .
those of us elected by the people in Europe can speak in this Parliament on behalf of so many of them who are saying no to war .
the other side of the coin is that we must ensure that the thousands of children we know about in the European Union can be put up for adoption .
if we listen to what the citizens are saying today , it is clear that they are aware that we need to introduce changes to the Treaty now .
after four years of the Stoiber committee &apos;s existence , is the Commission able to say which approach is the best and most effective ?
Madam President , I would like to begin my contribution by paying tribute to the many very brave men and women in Albania who have risked their lives and their livelihood in order to try to preserve peace , order and decency in that country .
I should like to emphasise what is stated in paragraph 15 of the resolution to the effect that it is probably better to have a decision of substance , even if we do not have everyone on board , than to have a decision lacking in substance which entails an unacceptable delay .
( A5-0338 / 2001 ) by Alain Lamassoure , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , on the proposal for a Council regulation on pre-accession financial assistance for Turkey ( COM ( 2001 ) 230 - C5-0219 / 2001 - 2001 / 0097 ( CNS ) ) .
I withdrew those of my proposals that concerned extending the Agency &apos;s remit to include the second pillar .
I have heard statements in this Chamber that show that some people have not entirely understood this : for instance , if I had to translate Mr Berthu &apos;s programme into action , it is clear that this would lead straight to a society which restricts freedoms , which would have nothing to do , let me say , with the quality of life , with the democratic quality of our societies .
in addition , with the scant human resources of the Committee members , who are always having to answer the demands not only of the petitioners but also of the governments , it is very difficult to work , Commissioner .
the Commission acknowledges the need for this second stage .
there have been individual MEPs who have exerted pressure , together with the Ombudsman and active citizens who have won one legal case after another .
but we all know very well that , irrespective of monetary union , the burden of debt in national budgets has to be drastically reduced in order to allow the Member States &apos; governments to take any action in the future .
needless to say , we must move towards more transparency of the financial flows with regard to infrastructure , but I should like to leave the powers where they are , and will therefore vote in favour of Mr Sterckx &apos; Amendment No 47 in which the Commission is still being requested to submit proposals in this field .
we await the outcome with great interest .
Madam President , I just wanted to explain that this directive on a uniform bus for Europe was rejected by all groups at first reading .
these revolve around a significant difference between banks and insurers with regard to the market and the prudential imperative , which is of the utmost importance .
. the Council would firstly like to thank the Member for the information he has communicated with regard to the violation of the fundamental rights of the Greek population of Georgia .
I would like to make a couple of general points : since 1988 , which is over 20 years ago now , the European Parliament inaugurated the annual Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought to honour persons or organisations for their contribution to the development of human rights and fundamental values .
we should recall for a moment that the key findings of this fact-finding committee include the following recommendations : the government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority should reaffirm existing agreements and immediately cease violence ; there should be a resumption of security cooperation ; there should be establishment of a meaningful cooling-off period and incitement in all forms should be discouraged .
we have no remit in this area , but it is a growing concern and we need to address it in some way .
the money was voted for an extensive programme and it looked on the face of it as if the Commission was doing a good thing by dividing it into many contracts .
Mr Rocard &apos;s questions , I hope , will take the debate further and I will at least be able to listen to the Commissioner in the time available to me .
it is a separate issue that requires more analysis , and that is for a longer term .
it is for these reasons that I believe this election was a huge step forward for Slovakia .
two weeks ago I spent the entire weekend and most of the week trying to negotiate for the handover of children who had been illegally abducted from the United Kingdom and taken to Italy .
we Europeans are constantly being charged with wanting to make life difficult for large , successful companies .
yes , smoking damages health and causes major problems for the smoker and for passive smokers .
the rebels are destroying specific infrastructure targets , cutting off the public &apos;s supply of electricity , and murdering both police officers - who are poorly trained - and government officials in the provinces .
in particular , I would like to refer to the obvious but important fact that support for regional economic integration amongst developing countries needs to be based on the realities facing developing countries in the individual regions in question .
this violation of the international legal order is unacceptable .
on the other hand , we are sure , we and the European Union , that we have done all that we could to make it possible for an agreed solution to be reached on the future of Kosovo .
the Luxembourg presidency has stated that a directive on the return of asylum seekers is a priority .
if they can accept responsibility , then they will be able to benefit from our solidarity .
today &apos;s European Council was , in my opinion , very important and , given the complexity of the issues raised by this conflict , the European Union must and had to react collectively and define , by mutual agreement , the appropriate responses .
I believe that a balance needs to be struck between the economic consolidation process and the protection of investments through jobs and sustainable development .
that is why I have also voted against the report , and I hope that in the legislation , we will show more grit and determination and make it clear that we really take climate issues seriously in Europe .
I totally agree with what Wim van Velzen and Thomas Mann said on the subject . But I think there is something else going on here .
here in the European Parliament we must bear our responsibility and define the new structures and priorities which will encourage employment .
the vote will take place at midday on Thursday , 17 February 2011 .
on the eve of the Florence summit at the end of the Italian presidency , I should like to draw attention to three points that seem to me essential , if not vital , for the future of our Union .
let us recognise that something remarkable came out of the ruins of Europe in 1945 .
the amendments presented by Mr Pérez Álvarez were aimed at highlighting and providing a remedy for these shortcomings and the amendments I am going to mention now have the same aim .
I am referring , for example , to Austria and Sweden .
it features an impressive number of omissions , exemptions , exclusions and limitations of liability , however , which would turn the new rules into an illusion , and often even an opportunity for confusion and for backing away from the objective of protecting the public , unless the taxpayer is called on to make good the deficits .
I believe that over the last few months , we have demonstrated that we are not simply using the concept of &apos; mainstreaming &apos; as an embellishment for our policies , but also wish to translate it into practice .
it is difficult to have any certainties in this field . However , I have one : there is no miracle solution , nor is there one single solution .
this Parliament challenged the original agreement between the US and the EU because it believed that the legal basis was wrong and disagreed with the substance .
the most important issue for this summit is to achieve a breakthrough in the enlargement negotiations .
we need to have a system that operates as an alternative to anarchy so that we can safeguard international law through , for example , the UN .
the members of the delegation had concluded that encouragement should be given to these efforts aimed at establishing democracy in Algeria .
I can tell you that in Luxembourg we have no deficit at all and we have fairly low taxes .
intense consultation with industry to establish a ban from within and to introduce self-regulation in the processing of these substances , came to nothing .
Turkey is not Europe , either in cultural or geographic terms , though it has extremely strong commercial ties to Europe .
let us wipe out misery , sadness , impotence , terror , anguish , death and the destruction of wealth .
on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , the Small Business Act is precisely what we , as politicians and legislators , should be focusing on as we look for ways of fostering new growth and re-energising our economies .
others say the opposite , that we must stick to the Pact more tightly .
we must have an end to this type of dishonesty that characterised Fianna Fáil &apos;s approach to the question of joining Partnership for Peace .
Mr President , I will be even briefer , because the President-in-Office has already said it all .
furthermore , the declaration will help to establish and present a single European Union stance at fora involving a range of humanitarian organisations .
priorities for action identified in my report include a carrot-and-stick approach to enforcement of existing legislation .
two unusual things that will hopefully not be left to some chance majority .
my report , as approved by the Committee on Regional Development , also contains other important forecasts , of which I should like to remind both the British minister present and the Commissioner .
but the honourable Member will be aware that wool is not included in Annex II of the Treaty of Rome and is therefore not considered as an agricultural product .
we shall prepare a report on this request by the end of 2006 .
in summary , I believe the instruments we have will allow us to confront the current situation with a certain degree of coordination .
in Romania , a president is attempting to discredit the press and journalists criticising him .
such an instrument could use the financial technique of buying and selling options on the world market and would prove useful as a way to combat speculation .
the debate is closed
unfortunately , he must serve another six months of a one-year sentence .
regarding the draft Eurodac Convention , I would first of all like to emphasize that the Council submitted this text for the opinion of the European Parliament on 6 October 1997 .
the EU delegation was actually the only one to set out for Johannesburg with a negotiating agenda , which became the Conference &apos;s sole agenda .
a way must be found to restore the harmonious balance between Parliament and the Commission .
I can say to you today that the proposed increases include , among other things , a rise in the maximum guaranteed quantity of 212 400 tonnes , and among the modifications , it is proposed to distribute the increase among the national guaranteed quantities of the producer Member States .
I believe the European Union has a special part to play here , and we shall have to see how we can step up our activities in support of children ’ s rights .
we now find ourselves in a new situation , the Council must first of all get used to the fact that it no longer has the last word .
Mr President , first of all I would like , on behalf of the President-in-Office of the European Council , on my own behalf , on behalf of all the other Presidents of the various configurations of the Council , and also on behalf of the whole of the Luxembourg Presidency , to thank you all for your congratulations , your positive assessments and , above all , for the encouragement that you have expressed during this debate .
Vice-President of the Commission . - Mr President , let me start by saying how much I agree with what the Spanish Presidency has just given as answers to some of the questions of the parliamentarians .
I would like to close by expressing my thanks to the Portuguese Presidency and in particular to Mr da Costa for his cooperation , to Commissioner Barnier , to you and all our colleagues , and of course , to my co-rapporteur Mr Leinen , with whom we worked hard but very well . I would also like to thank the members of Parliament &apos; s Secretariat who assisted us and the interpreters , who on very many occasions worked long hours to enable the difficult negotiations you all know about to take place .
the proposal in one of the final paragraphs of the resolution stating the requirement for an integrated initiative by the European Union - when funding to Turkey is given the green light - and UNESCO and the Turkish Government to draw up an inventory of Christian and other cultural monuments in Constantinople and to put forward proposals for their restoration and maintenance is also very constructive .
we would also ask whether the increasing links between the tax and the social security systems are being addressed by Council and Commission , either within the context of the regulation or elsewhere .
let us be honest , what difference have they ever made ?
the problem I have with your speech is that you are denying that there is a problem .
I call on the Commission and Member States to establish proper criteria and benchmarks in order to evaluate the results achieved .
Mr President , one other brief point .
we do not know what damaging effects they have on our environment .
for example , Amendment No 15 to our resolution , seeking to reinstate it , must be rejected .
Qimonda is a paradigm case in the current context of global financial and economic crisis .
what happens is the boiler runs out and the heating bills go through the roof .
infant mortality is three to four times greater than the majority population .
- ( NL ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I think that most of us in Parliament agree that we need a European approach and that national monopolies have no future .
it is important , therefore , to improve and enhance this area , even taking account of the conclusions of the Fisheries Council of October 1997 , which has been mentioned here already .
I am afraid it is already too late , because we made a decision on this matter earlier .
several companies have already transferred their registered office using the possibilities offered by the European Company Statute .
just last month in his statement during the High-Level Event on Biodiversity at the United Nations General Assembly , President Barroso remarked that our ability to end poverty and hunger and improve child and maternal health depends on the long-term availability of fresh water , food , medicine and raw materials that nature provides .
this aim is to ensure that both sides can jointly address the global challenges that will dominate the summit agenda and prepare the ground for a more effective and mutually-beneficial cooperation .
in this context , I should particularly like to emphasise the need for increased and continued support for the global fund for combating HIV / AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria .
Hannes Swoboda , Joost Lagendijk and I will try to bring influence to bear on our Macedonian colleagues over the next two days .
I would urge you to impress on the Commission and the Council that Israel must be persuaded to end its veto on the development of the Gaza Strip .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( DE ) Madam President , may I say to Astrid that she should not always assume that Socialist motions will be untenable .
common EU rules in this area will help to reduce substantially pollution from hazardous substances .
I welcome the fact that European Union is prepared to play an active role in third-party monitoring operations in the Middle East and I believe that the European Union must and should play a stronger role in any future talks that may take place in the Middle East region .
this is also true for information and communications technologies and for the labour markets .
we thought you were talking about national and European solidarity .
it is clearly not by chance that feminists and anti-racists are by profession from the privileged classes .
whereas , on the one hand , the huge transmission capacity generated by digital technology will reduce the pressure on a shortage of transmission channels and on the public utilities , on the other hand new forms of public or private monopoly could arise - I refer in particular to the Microsoft case , which we are all currently following with interest - and the rules of competition might need to be reviewed in the light of new technological opportunities , so as to reorientate alliances along these lines .
it will be a first step towards explaining how the European Union is going to deliver on sustainable development .
in writing . - I voted for the successful amendment 29 , which calls on the Commission and the Member States to take measures to prevent capturing of the market in food products and the formation of cartels by food companies , and I hope that some action will be taken to prevent supermarkets from forcing food producers to accept economically unsustainable prices for their produce .
that is the wrong way to react , and I deplore such an attitude .
where is the ambition and drive of our great community when it comes to opening the door to those fellow Europeans who want to join it ?
the fact is that extensive areas of the Community suffer cycles of unbearable drought , and without water there can be no life , progress or solidarity .
we would like to hear from the Commission what it is doing about this , too , and not have to wait a few months before being able to debate what it is going to do in three or four years ’ time .
the European Union must play an active and autonomous role in supporting the peace process .
we want to support good programmes that help us to save energy and that is why the SAVE II programme should be allocated at least ECU 150 m if it is to be at all competitive .
before I comment in more detail on the amendments proposed , I would remind you that this is another proposal to establish a set of common rules for the alcohol sector after several attempts in the past , all of which failed for various reasons .
no , we can do much better .
the extent of foetal alcohol syndrome ( FAS ) and the best advice to offer to expectant women remains controversial .
but it is an ill wind that blows no good , so let us hope that those governments with a penchant for high taxation might come to the realisation that lower taxes across the board - and not just in this trivial area of duty-free sales - make economic sense and create jobs .
particularly in Africa and in the Third World generally , we have to start looking at ways we can give people ownership of capital .
but there is one person he forgot , and that is Mr Bossi . He is also a member of the Italian Government , and the least utterance from this man is far worse than anything that inspired this House to censure Austria and oppose the Freedom Party &apos;s inclusion in the Austrian Government .
I hope that good common sense will win out and that the Stability and Growth Pact will remain ; and , if any changes are made to it , at least let us direct them in a favourable direction .
from having been a rather closed institution , the EIB has begun to change its attitude to information and transparency .
the recommendation for second reading before us is about the Community statistical programme for the next five years , 2003 to 2007 .
I share the reservations voiced earlier in this Chamber by Mrs Kinnock .
on the other hand , I must also make a number of critical comments .
the common agricultural policy has come under attack .
at this time much more unites us than divides us .
it is also its most severe test .
so the 1 April deadline still looks rather ambitious .
as a young politician and diplomat , first as Secretary of State , then as Foreign Minister and later as Prime Minister of Portugal , he was a wise and passionate advocate for Timor Leste , as he was also for Africa , Asia and Latin America .
this particular enlargement of the European Union will be accomplished on Workers ’ Day , a date symbolising our need to face up to the challenge of giving the Union of 25 states economic and social cohesion .
it is in fact the same goal that the President of Iran has declared more than once : ‘ to wipe Israel off the map ’ .
over the course of time , the NGO co-financing line has been gradually increased , particularly as a result of Parliament &apos;s support , and it is now 100 times the 1976 level .
we need to look not only at what does not work , but at what does work , and we need your active commitment , Commissioner , in that task .
when economic crises prevent us from legitimising politics with the positive results we offer the public , we must contribute to this legitimisation with our scrupulous respect for the political values that we advocate : austerity , honesty , closeness to the public , and transparency .
I also object to rules which are incomprehensible in practice , such as those on honey .
ten per cent of the world &apos;s biomedical research funds are dedicated to addressing the problems that are responsible for 90 % of the world &apos;s burden of disease ; that is the imbalance .
as a result , relations between the EU and Pakistan have been operating on a new footing since the beginning of this year .
at least in Germany ministers have resigned .
against this backdrop , this report highlights the effects on growth , employment and macroeconomic stability of public finances and calls on the Commission and the Member States to work together to take measures to reverse the slow growth of the European economy and to pave the way for the smooth functioning of the single currency .
people who are seriously ill are turned back and medical staff beaten up .
regarding transport , here too the Environment Council has already taken practical measures to reduce pollution , for instance with the Auto-Oil programme and the voluntary agreement with the car industry I referred to earlier on introducing the &apos; 6-litre &apos; car .
in addition , the changes seem to be taking a long time . The Court of Auditors &apos; report states that , in May this year , the action plan which is to lead to improvements had not even begun to be implemented .
this compromise , which will serve as the basis for what will now be a permanent rule , takes the precautionary principle into account without , however , losing sight of the principle of proportionality .
moreover , when I woke up , I found that my pockets were full of euros because I had gone swimming with all my clothes on , being too embarrassed to take my clothes off among the euro coins .
in conclusion , I shall say once again that I do not share the reservations about the coins having national faces .
there is only one position that this Parliament can adopt : if a government is employing Stalinist or fascist methods , we must unhesitatingly protect our fellow Member from all the madmen in this House .
he has asked us this question : would we be willing to demand that 14 % should be spent on defence , as is the case in the United States ?
we also oppose any attack on salaries or on the pensions of workers in this sector .
Mr Cohn-Bendit said that it was not enough to provide food but that we had to talk too .
one particularly important issue is that of security and stability , and there is no doubt that the &apos; democratic calling &apos; concerns countries mostly considered as being allied with others that currently have democratic political systems .
this compromise is made up of Amendments 13 to 75 , inclusive , which the Group of the European People ’ s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , the Socialist Group in the European Parliament , the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance and my own group can support , as can also the Council and the Commission .
( DE ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I support the compromise reached for the resolution .
now , the states only have control over taxation , while control over the budget has been taken away .
one of the factors which is crucial to the safety of these products is the maximum quantity of minerals which they contain .
the use of the general basic principles of integrated plant protection will become mandatory for the entire European Union from 2014 .
we are concerned about certain backlashes lately , for instance , the young student who was expelled .
in Amendment No 4 , on behalf of my group , I have suggested including in the directive the possibility of Member States encouraging the reuse of packaging material .
we hear in the media now about a convoy getting through the Khyber Pass and going north .
there is a plan to privatise the beaches , so that Greece &apos;s debt can be serviced .
logically , this new edition follows the strategy of the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs .
Mr President , Mr Møller , Commissioner Patten , Mr Yiannitsis , ladies and gentlemen , a debate such as today &apos;s is an occasion on which to take stock of the Common Foreign and Security Policy , highlighting its positive aspects , whilst not omitting those that merit criticism .
my second observation is that , according to several experts , and as Mr Busquin , Commissioner for Research mentioned earlier , there are other routes open to respond to the legitimate expectations of those who are suffering from serious genetic illnesses .
Madam President , Russia has proclaimed a modernisation programme and some observers are speaking about a new perestroika .
written statements ( Rule 149 )
greater investment in networks and research is called for . So too is greater investment in development and innovation .
this can be achieved by redistributing the workload , reducing working hours , introducing part-time work , reorganising the work process , cutting the supply of work to employees by granting individual and collective rights to leave of absence and by granting sabbatical leave , which Mr Mann had in his report but which his group now wishes to delete .
this is the sort of thing whereby precedents are created , since in neither case do the fundamental conditions for accession appear to have been met , even though they are required to be even before any accession negotiations are started , and not only on paper either .
it does not say much for good governance when the Commission secretly issues strategic documents , instead of holding an open debate about how we can continue with the solidarity mechanism in the light of the major challenges which face us , such as climate change and demographic change , given the tight budgetary constraints .
this Parliament had already requested that foods for diabetics and sports foods should be covered by specific directives .
I say &apos; educational reasons &apos; because it would be a means of bringing home more clearly to the Member States that it is basically their own money or the money of their own citizens and taxpayers that is being managed so casually and - I have to be blunt - often sloppily too .
I would like to mention something of which I have personal knowledge .
regretfully I cannot offer congratulations to the Council for their part in this process .
in summary , I would say the Amsterdam test should be seen as an opportunity rather than as a threat .
however , this too will be part of the strategy ; the approach will apply to all European policies in all sectors , especially the research sector you referred to , and to other sectors of the European Union , such as the agricultural , transport and regional policy sectors .
at the meeting on 8 July , finance ministers agreed to the setting up of a high-level group , as the Members of the House will be aware , to examine this issue .
then there are a number of amendments requiring various reports to be submitted to Parliament .
given the lack of definitive conclusions on the effects of such a process , what is needed first of all is a vote of confidence in the ability of the beneficiary states to act responsibly .
for example , national authorities must develop a series of educational programs specifically to deal with this problem .
if you are prepared to table very controversial directives in another field , then I applaud this , for I am always pleased when the Commission is brave .
Mr President , first of all let me congratulate my good friend Mr Laschet on his brave attempt to reform the structures of the UN , which were shown to be sadly lacking during the recent Gulf War .
direct investments are playing a fundamental role in the whole process of development , and elements such as governance play a key and fundamental role in it , as do - as some of you have said - all the elements relating to better transfers of technology and any other element which allows for more appropriate development in these countries .
I am sorry if perhaps you have never heard this and it is not easy to translate , but it means that , without money , nothing is possible .
I speak as rapporteur for Bulgaria , a country on course for joining the European Union in 2007 .
the majority of people in Malta work in excess of 48 hours per week and need to do so for their own benefit and for the island &apos;s economy .
the export of usable goods is subject to the European Union ’ s approval ; I am glad to see Mr Cohn-Bendit agreeing with me on this .
as a result of this new initiative , all European Union Member States will establish formal incident-reporting systems to facilitate the collection of information on actual or potential safety deficiencies involving aeroplanes in Europe .
one such proposal , for instance , is the initiative for officials working in the European Parliament to attend equal opportunity training , since appropriate knowledge is indispensable when putting this principle into practice .
this is what the European Union should be promoting , as well as a multi-polar world . We should help Mercosur to be a democratic entity and more independent of the United States , and establish this regulation for citizens in view of the risks of the abolition of civil societies crushed by sheer market forces .
I particularly welcome the principles of non-discrimination and reciprocity , the possibility of jointly reviewing the execution of undertakings made , and the fact that data transferred are limited by the ‘ push ’ system , which sets a positive example to other similar agreements such as the one with the USA .
it is interesting that Mr Straw commented on the sparse attendance here and made an extremely limp attempt to be humorous about it .
I have here with me Nirj Deva , who is a fierce advocate of the necessary role that the United Nations must play in the world .
the coordination of the radio spectrum in the EU creates an opportunity for the provision of completely new services , and removes the obstructions that have existed until now , for instance on the viewing of television programmes on mobile phones .
Mr President , I am sure that this House , like the Committee on Fisheries , will support the signing of this Fisheries Agreement between the European Union and the Comoros , which follows on from previous protocols and which will enable 57 Community vessels to fish until 2010 .
one thing is clear , however : the EU ’ s crisis is also a crisis for some governments , and that is the reason time and again for the inability of the European Council to move forward on most points , as some governments do not want this Constitutional Treaty and others are hiding behind those who do not want it .
despite the difficulties arising due to the nature of the material and the limitations necessitated by security considerations , like you , we feel it is important to step up the provision of information .
obviously there is a good deal of interest in this Parliament on the British position on this subject .
the EU must persistently emphasise that it is unacceptable for Israel to treat Jerusalem as if it were its own private concern .
on the other hand , we have strong reservations about the method used .
the 2009 budget is also making a significant contribution to this solution .
it is our intention to develop this action plan through a broad web of public-private collaboration .
it should be noted that , as from 1 May , such a decision no longer requires unanimity in the Council .
we need to be very careful that what we suggest and propose is doable and we have practical results to show for it .
it is therefore a subject which forms part of our consultation in the future proposal , the third stage .
this is not a plague ; it is a disaster brought about by mankind , namely by the British Government &apos;s decision to change the temperature and pressure at which animal-based meal was manufactured .
you cannot imagine how much easier and more efficient my life would be if I depended much more directly on Parliament &apos;s choices , options and control over the use of my budget .
this being the case , we would like the Commission to provide this Parliament with epidemiological studies that clearly show the consequences of each asbestos fibre for the health of workers , which groups are at risk , to supply statistics that will enable a reliable study to be conducted and also to prevent some countries in the Union , six to be specific , from maintaining higher limits than those now being proposed .
two years after the disaster , only a few projects had been rubberstamped .
I hope that this House will continue to support these reasonable social innovations and I look forward to further constructive discussions .
there is an urgent need to introduce the recommendations relating to the prevention of disasters .
I particularly rely on the legislative activities at the U.S. Congress enabling the Copenhagen Conference to achieve global solutions .
( BG ) Thank you , Madam President .
I am a federalist but I am not a centralist .
this type of behaviour has no beneficial result and must be prevented .
Madam President , the Commission must confront these proposals in a spirit of cooperation and understanding , given that our purpose in forwarding them is to make our task easier .
the ground had barely been explored previously .
Mr President , Mr Posselt , we have to accept our responsibilities to ensure that the credibility of Parliament is defended in relation to human rights and humanitarian norms .
one says that the euro will bring nothing but benefits , and the other that it will bring nothing but drawbacks .
the Council statement showed that governments are not interested in principle , but in concrete trade interests that differ across the north-south divide .
however , there has been the Goldstone report .
it is only a small step from trampling down freedoms in the area of business to trampling down fundamental human rights and freedoms .
Íatural disasters
the rapporteur has gone to great lengths to obtain a compromise ; this text contained some good points , not least the idea that pension systems should guarantee all citizens a decent standard of living , that diversity should be respected , that inequalities between men and women are unacceptable and unjustifiable , that a life course approach should be taken and that older workers should be rehabilitated .
to take account of risks brought about by technological developments , the proposal introduces , in particular , new criminal offences such as grooming , viewing child pornography without downloading files , online sexual abuse or advertising the possibility to abuse children , for example , through Internet forums .
it is high time we did away with the idea that renewable energy and emission-free nuclear power are somehow opposed to each other .
I think it is very difficult for the people of the United Kingdom to accept that their energy policy should be decided basically by foreigners .
the carbon dioxide emission from all private cars in the EU could in theory be compensated for by thirty or so reactors replacing coal power .
there is cause for concern over the EU-US partnership in this particular area .
at the same time , although we are aware of the strong data-protection system established by the agency , several amendments represent additional safeguards .
imports are necessary .
the review of the European Union ’ s Sustainable Development Strategy is about how we can do things better to get results : first , about how we design policy , including policies within the Lisbon Agenda ; second , about implementing what has been agreed ; third , about making sure that we involve all those who need to act .
however , I am not satisfied that due regard has been given to motorcycles .
common efforts are needed in order to protect our societies , including our human rights , from attempts by terrorists to undermine them .
no one can vote in his own place and in someone else &apos;s and do it accidentally !
again the Court has failed to give a statement of assurance to the Commission .
we make a number of proposals that I commend to this House .
unfortunately the Berend amendment to the Cañete report attempted to establish a link between EMU participation and eligibility under the Cohesion Fund .
the Commission will also take the initiative to make sure that the next stage of the survey will comprise all the official languages that are studied in the European Union .
all Members have the right to join a committee .
the establishment of a working group on public procurement is definitely important .
greater Community support is needed to develop research into an oral vaccine to combat the various strains and to promote the use thereof should the need arise ; the total cost of vaccines should be borne by the Community .
indeed , at present , the only passengers covered by European legislation in the event of airline bankruptcy are those who book a package holiday .
Mr President , I simply wanted to know why this report , for which a qualified majority is required , has been postponed to the end of the sitting when we know very well that there are some Members who will be leaving .
only by collective resolve can we defeat the evil of terrorism , and I welcome the recent measures taken by European governments in this regard .
yet what we have in front of us is a regulation with a legal base that casts doubt on the ongoing right of Austria and Denmark to keep their stricter national laws beyond six years and that will actively work against the ability of other Member States to adopt them .
I would now like to congratulate the chairman , Mr De Giovanni , on the text of his resolution , which , I am convinced , will serve as a reference point for the next Parliament . I must say that it was a great privilege to work with him .
the Commission ’ s policy has been to try to make payments into the Global Fund in order that there might be a &apos; thinking head &apos; capable of generating a global strategy .
let us ensure that Kurdish citizens feel at home in one Turkish state .
the Mediterranean Basin is effectively the bridge between the North and the South , the East and the West , and , situated at the point where three continents converge , it is more than just a border for the European Union .
( Mr Cohn-Bendit held up a blue card )
should an epidemic occur , the EU should have a coordinating role .
current self-isolation is leading to destruction in Iran and has a toxic impact on neighbouring countries and on the rest of the world .
this is a complicated piece of work , and one for which I would like to thank Mr Karas , but it is only part of the work , and we need the right resolution mechanisms too .
I cannot imagine that these are measures to achieve savings , Mr Rack .
our emphasis on a comprehensive approach and strengthened cooperation between institutions will result in greater transparency and a more efficient use of resources .
very good progress has also been made on the animal by-products proposal , with the question of how to deal with catering wastes as the main obstacle to final agreement .
it is also necessary to standardize VAT regimes .
we want to see that cemented in the Treaty at Amsterdam .
I would in any case like to ask the Taoiseach , in the light of the collapse of the talks , to answer one very specific question .
it would be helpful if it could be properly explained .
) Mr President , our starting point is a Commission proposal that took advantage of a temporary situation , an all-time low , to justify an untenable restrictive proposal .
Mrs Schroedter , I did not say that I would put Amendment No 21 to the vote in any event .
however , what would you think if I told you that , as well as that , half of your population is over 50 years old ?
my primary concern is for usefully employed individuals , not benefit tourists .
the opposition charged Zia with filling the key posts in her interim government with sympathisers , accused the head of the electoral commission of being biased and asserted that there were 13 million invalid names in the electoral register .
but if it is to continue its good work , it needs to be properly funded .
since some of the islands are in essence parts of the aforementioned EU Member States , then in reality are France and Britain going to form relationships with themselves through this strategy partnership ?
Europe , above all others , has demands made of it .
( the sitting was suspended at 13.05 and resumed at 15.00 )
every challenge has its opportunities and risks .
thank you , Mrs Bonino , and I think you know that when I say that it is not just a formality .
it has put forward proposals which are placing the single market at risk and I think that the Community &apos;s soldiers - the Commission and the European Parliament - should march together on these issues , as it would benefit the single market .
rapporteur . - ( NL ) Madam President , Commissioner , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , since its inception in 1993 , the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia has indicted 161 people .
if you stop to consider that no institutional body in the European Union and no institution in any one Member State has studied or tabled more thoughts on the institutional aspects of the European Union than the European Parliament , then a contingent of 16 delegates is hardly in proportion to its contribution to date .
this is a matter that has been discussed by your committee .
of course not .
I would ask you , Mr President , to inform all the Heads of State or Government that it is because we do not want to interrupt the constitution-making process that the European Parliament is opposed to self-willed decisions appealing to popular national sentiment and premature statements by Heads of Government – such as the one made today by Tony Blair .
I would also like to stress that such an important document should not become an object of political games as is the case in Slovakia , where the opposition is blocking the adoption of this progressive and democratic document .
a second point is that a reform is already planned for 2009 .
why do you not stand up and demand that the Geneva Convention , which clearly provides protection for people who are persecuted for ethnic reasons , be observed ?
there is only one answer : water .
in the view of the S &amp; D Group , issues relating to the transparent and legal use of the European Union &apos;s budget are a priority and the management of public finances as a whole depends , to a large extent , on the successful resolution of these issues .
the Commission proposal has massively extended the scope of two definitions and in this case it has gone much too far , which is clear from the fact that 1 600 amendments have been tabled .
Hezbollah is also a major pawn in Syria ’ s policy and is undermining the peace negotiations between Israel and Palestine , as Mr Morillon pointed out .
violence against women is not only a question of crime and injustice against women , but also a question of men being the perpetrators , and it is a question of equality .
in conclusion , I should like to say how taken aback many Members of this House were on discovering that health services had been completely written out of the Commission ’ s opinion on the directive on services , even though the parliamentary vote showed a majority in favour of their inclusion .
taking into account , however , the Agency &apos;s overall role , it should maintain a high level of competences in order to perform its mission in monitoring evaluations , proposing recommendations and conducting specific market studies .
we are also investing to ensure that our own record stands up to scrutiny .
the growing use of surveillance and monitoring of people is worrying , as is the practice of profiling , based on data mining techniques and universal data gathering , irrespective of whether citizens are innocent or guilty , for the purposes of so-called prevention and control .
( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Eppink &apos;s report is quite remarkable , but I am a little afraid - and this has nothing to do with the rapporteur - that we are making the same points over and over again .
young people , those from minority ethnic groups , the elderly , people with disabilities , the homeless , the mentally ill and many others find themselves excluded in our societies in many different ways .
Madam President , like Mr Deprez , I too have reread the report written by Mrs Guinebertière last year , and I should like to quote from it , because I could not express it better myself . &quot; There must be an alternative to a purely American view of the world . &apos;
following the establishment of the Palestinian Authority , we have continued our intensive search for peace .
however , there are deficiencies too .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
we hope that one day this operation will be used as a model example of the ESDP and effective multilateralism in action and as due evidence of the European Union &apos;s desire to strengthen the United Nations and contribute to conflict resolution in accordance with international law and the responsibility to protect enshrined therein .
if he is somehow involved in the transfer of money - buying , investing or whatever - then he no longer enjoys this protection and has a full reporting obligation .
such a position , however , will seriously threaten the achievement of the main objectives by 2020 .
it is a good report in my view and its content is entirely relevant . Reports are always better received if they are presented by the rapporteurs themselves , and even more so in Edith &apos;s case .
I welcome the work done by this Parliament , much of it in an atmosphere of urgency , but I would underline the contribution made by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament , which should have received more recognition at the appropriate time .
people of Europe will thank us for voting through this report .
but at least what we pay for fish would reflect the actual amount of fish that it is possible to catch in Mauritanian waters .
just because I am not discussing their content , it does not mean that I have forgotten them or that the task force will forget them .
the European Commission remains of the view that the discussion and pursuit of social issues should not be used for protectionist purposes and it rejects any unilateral sanctions-based approach .
given the current advances in telecommunications and IT , setting up a shared database would make this possible .
as one of my colleagues has mentioned , GMO agriculture would enable us to actually produce a plant which is resistant to many diseases and could be sprayed a great deal less .
first , it is nice to start talking about the Constitution again .
just recently , I also met with a number of egg producers , farmers who are currently in the process of changing to the enhanced cages .
accordingly , the selection of GSP + beneficiaries is to be based on clear , transparent and non-discriminatory criteria .
Mr Schlyter recommends that you support the compromise text negotiated with the Council .
we know that the international community is affected by donor fatigue .
Commissioner , stick to it , put pressure on the Member States , and this House will support you !
the next four to eight years of professional experience no longer seem to matter .
Mr Erdogan , the prime minister of Turkey , has put women in Turkey back ten years .
the dramatic events in Palestine over recent months , the heroic intifada of the Palestinian people and barbaric suppression by Israel have forced the European Parliament to adopt a resolution highlighting the responsibility of the state of Israel .
I wanted to ask a supplementary question but I am afraid that I am going to have to return to the two parts of my question which have not been addressed .
B5-0094 / 99 by Mr Van Hecke , Mr Corrie and Mrs Grossetête , on behalf of the PPE Group , on the Lusaka cease-fire agreement ;
Conference of Presidents proposal - Appointment of Members of Parliament to the Bureau of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly
the first is , of course , enlargement as the overarching consideration . The second is the draft mid-term review .
rather than draw up a long list of quantitative objectives covering every conceivable aspect and then measure success in terms of the amount of reports and paper generated , we must clarify the objectives and ensure good communication .
we also need to realise that we live in a new era with very difficult issues that it is our duty to resolve .
the Socialist Group supports this report , but we have also tabled amendments .
on the other hand , the gross breach of principle in relation to official visits of EU member representatives is regrettable .
we are using all the data and analysis provided by agencies such as the one he mentioned in Vienna .
otherwise , if we give different signals , many other countries would think that we have watered down the provisions of the Birds Directive and might also ask for a derogation .
this is a dangerous tendency .
what the Commissioner is saying all sounds encouraging .
I would stress that , in this case , the Commission is not contesting the loi Evin as such , but the consequences of the application of the law on televised events held outside France .
I therefore hope that the European institutions will redouble their effects in implementing measures that speed up and improve the rates of utilisation of such an important resource as the EGF , which currently has very low levels of mobilisation .
as for information about what is happening on the ground , that is an issue which Dr Buseck is well aware of .
what is required is a change of emphasis .
one last point : in paragraph 9 , there is a phrase in the middle that needs to be considered deleted .
we have already seen through other recent reports that the road to hell is often paved with good intentions .
this is extremely important .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this directive finally closes the gaps in anti-discrimination law , and allows the European Union to meet its international obligations to protect human rights , as well as its obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities .
in particular , when assessing the number of jobs involved in the passenger and ferry services and cruise activities , the cabin crew and catering personnel have been taken into account as part of the crew . &apos;
environmental policy at European Union level or at national level depends in particular on spatial information or , in other words , on information which can be placed geographically on a map .
hopefully this Eurobarometer poll will be reflected when the Irish electorate next have an opportunity of making a decision on the issue .
thank you very much , Madam Commissioner .
( SL ) Mr President , Baroness Ashton , today I would like to congratulate both rapporteurs who have so brilliantly led this debate , a debate which has resulted in this document , or rather , the documents of both Mr Albertini and Mr Danjean , being approved .
in this respect , we shall be demanding but constructive partners .
our Group therefore regrets the fact that we still have no Commission proposal for set-asides for next year , even though farmers already have to prepare their land use plans .
policy Coherence for Development cannot be sidelined when negotiating bilateral and regional trade agreements , and has a key role to play if we are to ensure that the outcome of the Doha Round is not detrimental to development .
the negotiation of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement that began in January is an effective step in the right direction , since the prospect of integration with European structures will reinforce the move towards essential political , institutional and economic reform .
moreover , I hope that the special attention which the report pays to small-scale farming activities on the islands , which cannot be expanded , will also be taken into consideration .
I also believe that economic instruments are needed , along with regional , economic and commercial cooperation , including with regard to investments , which have already proven to be effective .
day in and day out , we are asked again and again just how we propose to put flesh upon them , and that is why I was so very moved by the way in which today &apos;s sitting of this House began with a strongly worded statement by it and its Members on what is happening in Zimbabwe .
compared to Germany again that would be the equivalent of almost 300 000 people , a situation which I am sure no European government would like to have to face .
we know that something needs to be done about it .
the consensus view is quite simply that we should wait first of all for any studies that have been commissioned and then wait for the evaluation of the Takeover Directive in 2012 / 2013 .
then there are those who say that the discussions about our own resources have no place in legislation on statistics .
but there was some misunderstanding , for they did receive a letter from somebody else that they felt gave them permission .
it is not on the table today either in the Council or in Parliament .
Britain is not a member of the Schengen group , so would not appear to be directly affected .
as the famous French comedian Pierre Dac used to say , &apos; Infinite patience is required to wait eternally for what never comes &apos; .
the European Union exists to promote the well-being of its 470 million citizens on a basis of equality ; it does not exist to serve shareholder value or the interests of sabre-toothed liberalisers and their market mechanisms .
we will now move on to the explanations of vote on the Cappato report , having already heard Mr Mitchell .
the sugar regime must be reformed as soon as possible .
of particular concern is the fact that despite critical remarks both by the Court of Auditors and by the European Parliament , some of these inaccuracies are repeated year after year .
the car industry itself admits - and none of us can be happy about this - that it has not been proactive in the past 22 years .
with regard to sectoral policies , I still hold with the suggestion of a communication on this subject by the Commission which must , by definition , be horizontal .
the whole concept is an actual farce because the results of these &apos; peaceful &apos; explosions can easily be used to develop weapons of war .
that is one thing I know for sure .
I would also like to raise the issue of people who are very mobile and their credit ratings .
it is difficult if there is no definition of what illegal pornography is .
opening the market to competition between France and Spain will mean little , because so long as we keep different track gauges we will not increase either freight or passenger traffic .
Mr President , I would also like to say thank you for the debate , which I feel has been very constructive , and I would just like to make a few remarks .
a European tax may still be &quot; future music &quot; , as the Germans say , but if we do not start playing it now , we will not be dancing to it in future .
we therefore support the Commission in its case before the European Court of Justice , in which it is seeking to prevent the competences under the Stability and Growth Pact from becoming obscured .
that is precisely what we are doing in the DDA and why we have a multilateral system and process governing these rules and an institution that enables us to negotiate precisely the strengthening and the improvement that you advocate .
the court must only be involved if the country concerned is unwilling or unable to deal with the matter .
as the use of electronic components to ensure the stability and safety of vehicles increases , all the more necessary , I believe , does the regular inspection of this electronic equipment become .
it is principally concerned with improving information and research relating to environmental pollutants and disease causation , and enhancing environment health communication procedures between Member States .
these have been the most important moments in the Council &apos; s expression of its political will to establish an area of freedom , security and justice in the European Union .
the Commission has allocated EUR 1 790 000 to two NGOs : Norwegian Church Aid and the Lutheran World Foundation for food and non-food assistance to persons affected by the conflict in Eritrea .
it does not want to know about the collapse of stocks .
without this regulation , we would have had no control over and no restrictions on approvals .
observance of this important fundamental right also furthers the normalisation of relations between the EU and Belarus .
on the other hand , however , let us be careful not to destabilise too suddenly , without allowing time to convert , a farming sector that involves 135 000 producers and employs 400 000 seasonal workers , in often very vulnerable agricultural regions .
I would like to ask the Commission to bring experts together so that we can properly assess the recent disasters .
the ability of Member States to defend their flag carriers should not be reduced .
that is regrettable .
what do we want ?
the figures were exactly the same - I shall never forget them - 12.7 % government deficit .
however , it always aims to consolidate the desired boost provided as part of the aforementioned economic governance , with the creation of the &apos; European Semester &apos; , the deepening of penalties ...
moreover , the self-same Council has difficulty reaching a decision as to the location of those agencies .
it must be prepared .
that is why the Commission can accept the amendment proposed .
the Lead State is to coordinate all the measures implemented by the Member States on the ground and is responsible for ensuring that all EU citizens receive support .
what instructions had you - or had you not - given to the driver ?
the atmosphere on the eve of the decision on accession talks could not be worse .
in writing . - The European Parliamentary Labour Party welcomes this Parliament report .
this item will be included at the end of today ’ s agenda .
the facts are that proceedings were brought against Italy , and quite rightly so .
together with Mr Sócrates you are going to open the borders .
Mr President , the initial text of this report was criticised for its aggressive language , focusing mostly on Iran &apos;s nuclear programme , neglecting the human rights concern and lacking a positive perspective for future cooperation .
the question we therefore have to deal with here today and in the future has two aspects :
by happy coincidence the Committee on the Internal Market went on a mission to Poland a few weeks ago .
my final wish and hope is that maybe next year we will have a more cheerful debate on the state of play in the area of freedom , security and justice .
quite the contrary , we think we should move towards a much more limited list , and remove the most suspect additives from the list .
it cannot continue to ignore them .
if we create a Euro-Mediterranean Development Bank , why not create one for the Baltic Sea , the North Sea , or anywhere else for that matter ?
the Balkan States must be borne in mind too , although further accessions may take place in the future in that area .
I share your opinion that , at present , we can only hope that these measures will together achieve the effect we all wish to see .
the implementation of this protocol is a political imperative if the European Union wants to preserve its credibility and if the world is to believe the current President-in-Office of the Council when he says that human rights have become a key element in the policies of the European Union .
the options for action by the EU will be kept under close review and weighed up in the light of Iran ’ s declarations and actions .
when they work using those skills they should not be taxed at all , that is my preference .
ammoniac pollution is an issue in agriculture in particular , and varies from region to region .
the example he gave was that you do not have a right to shout ‘ fire ’ in a crowded cinema , unless there is a fire .
so it is not a good idea to leave these matters in the hands of Member States - and certainly not a good idea to leave it in the hands of the current Irish Government , the ruling party of which Mr Crowley is a member .
the Commission &apos;s insistence since October 2008 on changing the 2002 directive is unacceptable .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should also like to congratulate Mr Chichester on his balanced , conscientious and consensual work .
that paragraph restricts the eventual options available to the West to prevent the development by Iran of a nuclear weapon .
we must continue to explore , as Spain is now doing with a number of these countries , the possibility of hiring and training workers at origin by creating workshop schools and vocational training facilities there .
the implementation of these measures is still painful and has sometimes even been extremely painful .
this is the only possible approach and does not prevent the EU from presenting its own opinions and objectives within the framework of global partnership .
for example , how can Frontex help bring down the tragic number of deaths at sea , over 12 000 in the last 10 years ?
we want to express our concern because , the more measures are taken to reduce the income and the rights of workers , the more pressures for further reforms increase .
in any event , the rapporteur has , in our judgement , correctly established the bases which will set the course for Section III of the Union &apos; s budget for 2001 and we are happy to offer her our sincere congratulations on her work .
this new project is part of the EUR 3.5 billion economic stimulus package which was announced by the European Commission last week in Brussels .
according to the common position of the Council , there could however only be a question of recommendation .
evidently , it has not yet penetrated the Council &apos;s mind that there is an urgent need for a comprehensive democratic reform of the European Union , for the establishment of European basic rights and citizens &apos; rights .
I commend the Commission for the strong stand it has taken in refusing to allow individual bilaterals between Member States within the EU and the United States .
Madam President , Commissioner , the reform of the common market organisation ( CMO ) imposed by the united forces of the lobbyists and Eurocrats will cause three serious problems .
Madam President , the rapporteur , whom I also want to congratulate on his first-class work , makes it crystal clear that it is urgently necessary for the Commission to draw up a comprehensive action plan .
the aim of the Commission &apos;s proposal is to correct this situation .
finally , the third report concerns the European Fund , modelled more or less on the IOPC Fund , which was unable , a year and a half after the Erika disaster , to compensate the victims , although the appropriate authorities had made the necessary financial promises and set early deadlines .
I therefore consider that it is of the utmost importance to uphold the position calling for the introduction of both a minimum excise duty of 57 % and a minimum payment - EUR 70 - with the aim of increasing the sales price of tobacco .
in connection with this , a question was raised about a possible link between the relocation of companies within the EU , the role of EU financial instruments and controls exercised by the Commission over State support .
I therefore believe that we are quite right to call on the Commission to carry out further studies in this area .
now , the concept of &quot; uniform harmonisation &quot; is one of those muddled expressions which totally obfuscates the integration process in question .
each Member State will redefine its own fiscal policy .
finally , as regards the proposed amendments to the report , the Commission would advise against amendments 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 , but it could support amendments 7 and 8 , which are in line with the spirit of the communication .
making this choice does not mean evading the culturally difficult problem of teaching young people to construct their own rules of behaviour as consumers . It does not mean evading the usually difficult and politically obdurate question of the financial involvement of Members States in the tobacco industry and in other public health threats such as alcohol , taxation of income from prostitution , and so on .
it has to be proven that such disclosure would undermine the institution &apos;s ability to function .
on services of general interest in particular , I will say clearly that we should take specific national circumstances into account , because it is true that some of our fellow citizens are a little alarmed - I am thinking , for example , of the French - when they feel , wrongly , that Europe is endangering the public services which are a French tradition .
that is something that we in the Danish Liberal Party have been fighting for for a very long time .
Airbus too is an example of what we can do together if we only unite .
the opposition of the French and British Governments seriously affects us all . We must overcome France &apos;s over-sensitivity about national sovereignty and the British Government &apos;s refusal to accept both Europe and democracy .
we should also recognize that this is not just an important economic directive , but also one that is important for the protection of the environment and public health .
that makes it absolutely necessary to keep all the options open when it comes to reducing emissions , and to do so using instruments that are both environmental and based on the market .
this is a crushing rebuke , in fact .
television programmes aired in Russian will systematically be subtitled in Belarusian .
I would point out that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs ’ interpretation will be considered adopted unless it is contested before the Minutes of the present sitting are approved .
we believe that internationally recognised organisations such as the WHO should concern themselves with global world health issues .
such a procedure would undoubtedly have taken several years in the absence of Community instruments .
we call on Russia to abandon its veto and its blocking of the resolution .
this will enable each outermost region to define its own agriculture development strategy to cater to its specific needs .
of course , then we need to concentrate on things at national level , at Member State level , and there we need much more action than we have seen lately , especially regarding the structural reforms to the labour market .
I am also pleased to see that catering waste from abroad , such as may come from aeroplanes landing in our country , has been upgraded to category 1 .
the only question is how best to ensure it ?
we have respected that wish ; we have dealt solely with what we can deal with within the confines of Europe &apos;s internal market : the circulation of goods in the market that arise from the commercial hunt .
it will also evaluate family policies , especially policies on the work-life balance , in which it will rely mainly on cooperation with the OECD .
those Member States that did not ratify Protocol 13 to the European Convention on Human Rights should do this as well .
this week we approved a report on this issue without debate , but venture capital can give an enormous boost to small firms which are just starting up .
we shall make do with what we have .
we are starting questions to the Council 15 minutes late , so we will extend it accordingly .
these views were reflected in some of what Mrs Kallenbach said just now .
thank you for your answer .
as for women &apos; s rights and human rights , I hope that some progress can be made at the Intergovernmental Conference .
as rapporteur , and in agreement with the draftsmen for the Committees on Research and Budgets , I would therefore ask the House to adopt Amendments Nos 1 , 2 and 3 and reject paragraphs 4 and 5 .
has the Commission established , with the International Olympic Committee , a timetable with regard to the issue of drug taking in sport ?
new international problems and challenges threaten world peace and stability .
now a word on behalf of our already hard-pressed farmers , many of whom have written to my constituency office to strongly question the need for a directive on soil protection .
( Parliament adopted the motion . )
let me close with a few figures on the volume of next year ’ s general budget .
that is a debate for another time .
the next item is the election of the European Ombudsman .
finally , Mr President , I have a question for you : when will Parliament &apos;s Secretariat decide to opt for complete transparency and publish the names of all members of Parliament &apos;s voluntary pension fund ?
I mainly have the restriction of the simplified procedure and the attention to GMO traceability in mind .
.
we have to keep the pressure up in all areas by removing further barriers , intensifying pressure on Member States who fail to implement single market measures and , of course , extending into crucial new areas like financial services .
Europe ’ s key task is now to ensure that the largest CO2 emitter , the United States , will also accept obligations and that the involvement of such countries as China and India in the entire process will be honest .
the conflict in Kosovo is a bigger threat to international peace than the conflict in Bosnia ever was .
we want an order that defends freedom of expression as one of the supreme human rights , whilst also being aware of its limits , which are to be found in the freedom and dignity of others .
we therefore believe it is vital to carry out a very detailed investigation of the incident in order to determine whether possible interests that have not been clearly defined have led to the paper &apos; s being closed down .
despite the rhetoric , the creation of the Women &apos;s Ministry , the Karzai Government pursues anti-women policies , and there is no legal protection , while older legal systems still in position prohibit them from getting help .
generally speaking , I think that we are in a better position than we were at this stage before the Seattle conference .
it should be noted that for many people it is bad that there is a chemical industry , but , if we think about it , in those countries in which there is no chemical industry , the average lifespan is approximately a half or a third that of the developed countries .
we also reintroduced an amendment that was not adopted in committee , which proposes that an effective system should be in place whereby the asylum seeker will always have the right to appeal a decision and to await the subsequent decision in the country in which he applied for asylum .
traditionally , gathering statistics on energy has been based on voluntary agreements with the Member States , and it has been done in this way for years .
the numbers speak for themselves : in business aviation alone , small and medium-sized enterprises working in this field are multiplying , the number of aircraft is expected to double to 3 500 in the next decade and annual turnover amounts to more than EUR 25 billion .
under the 1993 directive , not only the diseased fish can be culled but also the farmed fish where individuals are affected , exactly like the case when one cow is sick in a herd and the whole herd is culled according to the principle of precaution .
in order to implement the synergy between coal and nuclear energy , however , we need high-temperature reactors ( HTRs ) .
so I really think this is a reversal of everything which Parliament has worked to secure .
the situation is in untenable conflict with EU principles of the rule of law .
human life is priceless , and the Member States must do everything in their power to protect it .
Mr Donnelly , that is an opinion on another parliament &apos;s decision .
it is necessary to check whether Union funds are being well used , whether these institutions are meeting the objectives outlined for them , and whether any resources are being wasted .
it would be remiss of me , however , if I omitted to mention the constructive cooperation with the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy .
however , Irish workers and community activists are fighting back .
because , as you have already stressed , we do not need one more process after another , one procedure after another ; rather we need action by which the people of the European Union can measure the benefits and added value of what the European Union does .
I voted in favour of this Agreement because I learnt that the Agreement concluded by the Commission replaces , for the better , certain provisions in the existing 17 bilateral air services agreements concluded between EU Member States and Vietnam .
furthermore , the idea of obtaining resources to apply them to the more economically needy countries presents such complexity , when we consider their application in practice , that it appears simply impossible .
Israel cannot therefore be permitted to monopolise foreign policy in its part of the world .
it is from this perspective that I would like to present this report on the Community framework for nuclear safety .
the first is to improve the operation of the Funds themselves and to prepare the Union for the great challenges which await it and which we all now know by heart : expansion , the reform of the CAP , policies on the environment , policies on employment , the training and movement of young people , and the fight against this century &apos;s ills , such as cancer , AIDS , drugs , including the new sickness , that of trying to legalize drugs .
the Slovenian and then the French Presidencies must work with Ireland to try to find a legally acceptable solution that would put an end once and for all to more than 15 years of efforts to reform the workings of the enlarged Europe .
just half of what has been spent on cooperation in the Mediterranean has gone to all countries of the former Soviet Union .
according to information which has come to light in Greece , a great many of the projects jointly funded from the Community budget under the Second Community Support Framework for Greece , particularly road-building , have been carried out in a slipshod manner and , in general , do not meet Community specifications .
obviously all this directive does is get things moving .
although some truly positive elements can be found in this text , it would be totally unacceptable for the mechanism of old-age insurance to be considered through the prism of budgetary constraints , with capital-based pensions encouraged as a result .
Minister , it was the Council that called on Mr Βarnier , a distinguished European and successful Commissioner , to table a proposal to you , not us .
such is the purpose of the amendments which the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations has tabled , some of which have been adopted by our Assembly .
unfortunately , the Group of the European People &apos;s Party and European Democrats is once again using the requirement of 314 votes to get its own way .
consumer organisations favour binding measures for a collective redress judicial scheme in all Member States in combination with other options , such as the extension of existing alternative dispute resolution ( ADR ) mechanisms to collective claims .
it is also evident from the number of requests for information on this subject that the Commission receives each day .
we have a new round of negotiations before us .
in various other situations , however , the European Union has not been able or has not succeeded in contributing decisively to solving conflicts and tense situations .
now we have to look the truth in the eyes and admit that it often takes more time to solve deep-rooted problems and provide follow-up than is possible using the United Nation ’ s resources , taxed as they are by a large number of crisis areas , if there is no additional investment .
so I believe it is necessary to set limits .
two days ago I spoke to the Jordanian Foreign Minister , Mr Abdel Ilah Al-Khatib , who is planning , with his Egyptian counterpart , to visit Israel before the Arab League meets with the Quartet at the end of June .
we shall proceed to the vote on the proposal of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , to include a Commission statement on illegal imports of BT 10 maize into the European Union .
so , although there has been a long period of gestation , I hope those who have worked so hard in favour of this project will feel that now it has been launched , it has been well and truly launched and that real and positive results are very much within our sights shortly after the summer break .
the problem with self-regulation and co-regulation is that they represent a step backwards ; they mean returning to the Middle Ages , when certain sectors produced rules which bound everybody .
as the protocol stands , financial contributions from individual parties will be based on each party &apos; s share of CO2 emissions .
I urge Members to sign this and do something that matters .
I would also like to stress how welcome it is that this Parliament takes the view that the economic and monetary policy not only of the European Union but also of the Member States should be guided by the principles of the social market economy , the main elements of that economic system being named as freedom and democracy , competition , price stability , sustainable growth , subsidiarity , solidarity and private property .
by Mr Kirkhope , on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , on the initiative of the Kingdom of Sweden and the Kingdom of Spain with a view to adopting a Council Framework Decision on Accreditation of Forensic Laboratory Activities &#91; 11419 / 2009 - C7-0100 / 2009 - .
however it seems its coalition MEPs here favour a freeze .
whilst the hanged men of Chicago died in 1886 for an eight-hour working day and a 40-hour working week , here we have , at the beginning of the 21st century , the great social innovation of the European Union , which should seek to raise the ceiling on the maximum weekly working time from 48 hours to 65 hours , or indeed above that in the event of individual or collective agreements , with the reference period for calculating the maximum weekly working time increased from four to 12 months .
we need to examine the matter very carefully and with a great deal of sensitivity .
these images say it all : what was previously impossible was suddenly within their grasp , and then they returned to their everyday lives .
as far as the conditions of survival of refugees are concerned , a typical example is Greece , where thousands of Kurds live in shanty towns in Lavrio and Afghans and other refugees sleep in cardboard boxes on the beaches in Athens , deprived of even the basic necessities .
I therefore fear that the ratification of this highly necessary agreement may be rejected in the European Parliament in a similar way to the SWIFT Agreement , unless the Commission can inform Parliament regularly as to the structure and limits of the negotiated agreement .
air agreements currently belong to this category .
it is well-known that the investment services directive is the bedrock of the EU legislative framework in the field of securities markets .
I also share the view that the proposals should concern the information made available by industry and not by third parties such as journalists and scientists .
in Wales , we have enjoyed generous support from the EU Structural Funds , and I would like to see that support continue for West Wales and the Valleys .
in 2006 , under the Black Sea Memorandum of Understanding , over 4,650 inspections of ships belonging to 83 flags were performed .
without the political agreement reached at the Fisheries Council of last June , it is unlikely that we would now have these two proposals for regulations on fishing deep-water stocks .
the Committee also regards five points in this programme as being particularly important , and I expect the Commission to support us in this .
Parliament has consistently shown its commitment to this programme by supporting a ECU 100 million increase in its funding over the next two years of the programme .
( applause )
one aspect to which little attention is paid in this area is that knowledge , unlike other production factors ( such as capital , minerals , and agricultural and other land ) , is not a scarce resource .
we shall of course vote for a resolution which is intended to strengthen the fight against the sexual exploitation of children .
( IT ) Mr President , Commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , we are laying the foundations for the Europe of 2020 , imagining it to be inclusive , intelligent and innovative and , in doing so , we must clearly situate the challenges we face in a global context .
we therefore demand an independent investigation under the aegis of the United Nations .
we welcome the new Presidency &apos;s announcements and the first steps it has taken .
furthermore , the Community has always referred to the convention in implementing its external fisheries policy and in concluding bilateral fisheries agreements and other multilateral fishing accords .
‘ welcomes existing cooperation with the United States in the fields of non-proliferation ’ .
I simply mention it so that the House is not disappointed if it should turn out that the reform is not fully complete by 2005 .
the Commission is also making significant efforts to establish a solid basis for effective intercultural dialogue , not least in the Mediterranean - a focus for the new neighbourhood policy - with the imminent report of the High-level Advisory Group and the proposal for a Euro-Mediterranean Foundation .
the report is asking for a reform of the financing side and we are to respond by indicating new resources .
the report should be sent to the International Criminal Court in The Hague for examination .
these new technologies can significantly improve vehicle safety and it is clear that road safety will benefit when they are introduced as the standard system on new vehicles .
this approach should be introduced into all the chemicals directives because it safeguards our surroundings and health at the same time as promoting technological development .
it should be noted at the outset that not everything in the Council ’ s proposal was to the liking of the aforementioned four countries .
this work must be protected from slanderers and opponents but it must also be further improved upon - it is not true that there is no scope to do this - and we must reject the theories of those who do not want to change anything , or else all the work that has been achieved will come to nothing .
nearly 90 % of all errors identified or highlighted by the Court of Auditors concern the Member States .
the emergence on the market of numerous new private service providers using new technologies and telecommunications was what basically lured many sports federations into making preferential sales of these rights .
that is very important because it is a political affirmation of research and development that would strengthen our hand in future debates , which also link into budgetary issues .
I would like to give you this opportunity to let us know what you understood the protocol of that meeting to be , and perhaps also to clarify what you said to the press afterwards .
that is why I was not surprised when , during the exchange of views in the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs a few weeks ago , the Commission - although supporting the current proposal - mentioned it would come up with a new proposal at a later stage .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy . - ( ES ) Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur , because he has really tackled a subject that goes much further than we might imagine .
in this case , however , in addition to access to investments and markets , there is also the central concern of access to , and control of , sources and flows of energy , as well as other raw materials , especially rare earths , of which there is a serious shortage in the EU .
we very much want to support them and be by their side .
it was the European establishment , by its blindness , which was the source of BSE , so that the most formidable of communicable diseases , the ideological prion which is the source of everything , is perhaps European spongiform encephalopathy , and of this we are your &apos; sentinel &apos; GPs , my dear colleague , Professor Cabrol .
as rapporteur for all regulations on the basis of which Eurostat has to quickly compile the best of statistics for us , I would again like to recommend here and now that you approve my two reports with the usual enthusiasm .
this fund is an unwelcome substitute for help by Member States .
the pigmeat market is characterised by over-supply .
thank you for your attention .
it was during the Italian presidency of the WEU two or three years ago if I am not mistaken that that initiative was taken and their participation has been standard , active and effective .
fortunately , however , it seems to me that the Cocilovo report gives some additional guidelines .
that is why we proposed it to both institutions .
that is why we welcome the Commissioner &apos;s remarks on expected growth and on increased competitiveness on the European defence equipment market .
if we are to weed out violence and terrorism , we need as much money as possible and more effort .
let me say at the outset that it is based on values .
this distinction is essential .
the Commission has already called a meeting of national experts in these fields , which will be held in the next few days , on the basis of a working paper that is being drawn up to present the proposals that I have just mentioned .
only Belgium has not yet implemented Directive 94 / 80 / EC which establishes the method of exercising the right to vote and eligibility for local elections .
I understand your concern , but the Rules of Procedure must be respected .
what is a terrorist organisation ’ s main ally ?
in terms of foreign direct investments , Mercosur is also a key partner .
this is why the Commission took the initiative to address the problems caused by the drinking of alcohol by young people in the form of a Council recommendation which is a valid instrument foreseen under the public health article of the Treaty , namely Article 152 .
Mr President , adoption of this report , of this very precise and lucid report by Mrs Mann , presents no particular difficulty .
in our view , only such a political line of rapprochement could provide some safe outcome , first for the urgent needs of short term nuclear safety , and secondly , for the need to create a climate of peaceful cooperation in Europe , reminding ourselves of this obvious truth , which is apparently too often forgotten : the Russian Federation is also in Europe , and no-one has the power to expel it .
furthermore , this programme must award operational grants to organisations active at European level in the field of equality between women and men .
a common tax base would inexorably lead to common tax rates .
on behalf of the UEN Group . - ( PL ) Mr President , for some time now we have been aware of the Russian company Gazprom &apos;s worrying penchant for collecting former leaders of European Union countries .
we need to do them as well .
the issue of access also includes transport and public buildings .
Heads of State and Government themselves in the end became involved in the Intergovernmental Conference .
overall , I believe that Parliament has achieved a reasonable result that will benefit consumers in Europe .
I have one final thought with which to conclude .
first of all , it is beyond me why the Commission wants to allow EU countries to fish for &apos; free &apos; species in the North Sea without any restrictions .
both EUROPOL and Schengen will add hugely to the construction of fortress Europe .
I refer to the thirty or so Euroregions , as they are called in the Treaty , which are still operative and whose problems have not been fully covered simply because we are now dealing with other regions with a greater eastward exposure .
a series of projects are currently being implemented with the aim of improving the system .
we need that to be put into effect relatively quickly .
Mr President , my constituent David Wilson was jailed in 2003 because illegal migrants had hidden in the back of his lorry at a Greek port .
the fact that fellow Members with such ambitions almost unanimously support European cohesion policy demonstrates the importance we attach to the project of rebalancing development across different territories .
these would reportedly lead to further decay of the railway business and deterioration in the quality of services , and would force personnel to strike more , for reasons of self-preservation .
the Commission has been particularly shocked by the atrocious killing of 17 aid workers from the NGO &apos; Action Contre la Faim &apos; and has urged the authorities in Sri Lanka to investigate these killings immediately and thoroughly and to give assurances that they will do everything possible to ensure a safe humanitarian space in the country .
our good will towards copyright holders must not involve our creating regulations which restrict freedom of expression or obstruct the free flow of information .
effort !
where the committees act , we must of course work towards simplification - we appreciate some of the features of simplification contained in the Commission &apos;s text - and naturally also towards control .
all these things are very important .
one of the reasons for drafting this report was the fact that the new Member States are already teaching all of us a lot about how to deal with the internal market .
quite to the contrary !
the Minutes of the sitting of Thursday , 28 March 1996 have been distributed .
Madam Commissioner , as has often been stated in this House , cathedrals , tapestries and great palaces are all part of Europe . They represent a great cultural heritage that we must not lose .
in writing . - ( RO ) I decided that abstention is the position that expresses in the best way the heterogeneous content of the report .
written Statements ( Rule 116 ) : see Minutes
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that this evening &apos;s debate on the structural funds is of great importance , and I should like to stress that , although these funds account for almost 30 % of the European Union budget , this budget is less than 2 % of the gross domestic product of all the Community Member States .
in writing . - ( PT ) I strongly support the goal of abolishing visas for all countries in the Western Balkans .
I have always supported four requirements in the REACH dossier .
in theory this may work .
cast your mind back , Mr President . On 16 July 1996 , in view of the information that he had in his possession , Mr de Villiers threatened to table a motion of censure if a committee of inquiry was not set up .
this directive requires the Member States to take measures to :
another idea that has mileage in it is to gradually abandon subsidies that are harmful to the environment , along the lines of what the Commission has done for tobacco .
we must also be consistent in the way we judge non-member countries and especially certain EU candidate countries , including Turkey .
at present the Commission &apos; s road safety budget is EUR 8 million per year .
I have already held a meeting with the airlines , to whom I made it very clear that this is a key issue , and I think that we can reach solutions that are acceptable to everyone .
these things are necessary , but they should not be the picture that is presented to the people of Europe .
I hope that due consideration will be given to certain concerns expressed in committee by myself and other colleagues and that a number of amendments correcting and clarifying the text adopted by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs will be adopted , so that misapplication and unilateral measures which would harm our cause are avoided .
long term today &apos;s Parliament decisions will be a major factor in dealing with unemployment and consolidates the economic base of the EU to meet the challenge of world trade .
we cannot continue to allow our children to be destroyed in this way by the drug underworld .
I should like to reiterate quite emphatically that the presidency would like to reach an agreement on the 2002 budget as early as November at second reading of the Council .
being on one side Ulster Catholic , on the other , Scots Presbyterian , I have always felt that I have something of a personal stake in power sharing .
any thoughts of unilaterally imposing a solution on Kosovo may prove to be counter-productive .
that is our objective .
the G20 , aided by its creator , the European Union , therefore has a very important programme in June in Toronto and , in the second half of the year , in South Korea .
in the future I believe it will be highly desirable for the European Parliament to be more closely linked with the decisions that are adopted and finally to take into account the proposals of an assembly that represents European citizens .
the second step in the Commission &apos;s proposal , namely the European harmonisation of preferential measures , also points in the right direction , in my opinion .
the Spanish legislation is not doing that , it is prescribing a decoder - not even a uniform decoder , by the way , but a decoder with a common interface .
on the contrary , there is a different discourse : whereas now civil society is consulted privately and indirectly , we are proposing that such consultation should be transparent and in the open , so that everyone can see where particular ideas and positions arose or where certain suggestions come from .
the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) is an EU legislative and budgetary instrument that was set up to provide additional assistance to workers affected by the consequences of major changes in the structure of global trade .
that is why I cannot say ...
Mr President , inconsistent and contradictory events are currently taking place within the Israeli State and society .
Mr President , it is now one and a half years since we were able to congratulate the Commission on the Cotonou Agreement , and it is really somewhat disgraceful that there are still only three EU countries that have ratified the agreement .
these are questions which I would be pleased to receive an answer to .
if this were not the case , I do not think there would be much difference between us and China .
they are now paying the price for the errors of management and administration and the errors committed by uninvolved shareholders who allowed financial considerations rather than the interests of the industry to carry the day , but the solidarity of workers across Europe will be their strength in getting the restructuring plan reviewed .
I congratulate the rapporteur and the Vice-President of the Commission for the opinions they share on an issue which is so important and so sensitive in the daily lives of our citizens .
we have lost a lot of money .
it is also estimated that the judiciary fails to convict in 94 % of the cases brought to court .
item 33 of the motion for a resolution calls on the Commission to consider introducing specific European regulations in order to stimulate the development of the film industry in the candidate countries .
unfortunately , only three Member States were courageous enough to open up their labour markets at that time .
all of those who observed that process know that it is a difficult operation and was carried out under time pressure .
it is necessary to maintain a balance and I am proud of the work we are doing in this field .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , here is my brief supplement to what was introduced by President Barroso , after listening to the comments of the honourable Members .
it is a regrettable fact that the Council is quite clearly on the wrong side of the fence on this matter .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am very pleased that our debate on monetary union today is not about &apos; if &apos; but about &apos; how &apos; , and that this applies to all groups .
there is a lot for us to do .
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday , 29 October 1999 .
the order of business is thus adopted .
incidentally , Mr Danilishin has never been a member of any political party , so the charge brought against him is entirely economic in nature .
the decision taken in Luxembourg , on 12 December 1997 , by the Heads of State and of Government of the fifteen governments , to commence accession negotiations with the ten countries of east and central Europe and with Cyprus as from the beginning of next year , is an historic event of major importance .
at present , as the House will know and as we have already heard in the debate , there are two sets of rules for inland waterway vessels in the European Union : those applicable on the Rhine and those applicable on the other inland waterways .
are countries like Ukraine , the Republic of Moldova , Georgia and others such as those in the South Caucasus really less important ?
two years ago , aid from the EU Member States to industry that produced and used hard coal , that is to say , anthracite , was as much as EUR 2.9 billion .
it would be totally unacceptable if those ACP countries which have traditionally provided bananas for the EU market and whose economies depend on the revenue they receive from the banana trade lose out when new arrangements come into effect .
if colleagues in this House start quoting the poisonous drivel from The Sun and attributing it , however indirectly as Mr Macartney was doing , to the actions of a party they oppose , that is dangerous .
ultimately , this is producing truly dramatic consequences for consumers throughout the world because food prices among others have also shot up as a result .
we cannot defend the European project by attacking the single market and trying to fragment what has been one of the greatest achievements of our integration in Europe .
if that is to be possible , Parliament must be strengthened in its key functions .
I hope the European Parliament and the national parliaments can play a little role in the Plan D you put forward with the Council and Commission .
statements by the President
( NL ) That is a very interesting question , and this is also a subject on which there will be a great deal more discussion in this House .
does the Commission consider that it has provided information to the Member States that raises doubts about the real origin of all products exported by Israel ?
although people feel somewhat divorced from Europe , not least because the procedure that led to the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon was troubled , not always clear and often open to criticism , the European institutions must persist in and commit themselves wholeheartedly to making the greatest possible number of documents available in good time , thus helping to close the gap .
by way of reminder , Galileo is merely a giant clock consisting of around 30 satellites capable of determining a position in time and space very accurately .
we support these critical remarks , and I must therefore state that it would seem quite absurd , against this background , to vote in favour of approving the accounts .
there would in effect be a duplication of measures in different pieces of legislation each seeking to do the same thing , but in an inconsistent manner .
.
surely the very point that he makes about enduring unemployment and the need for us to address those challenges , makes the case for Hampton Court .
that is why the Commission hopes to encourage international cooperation in this area and will be organising a meeting this year with international organisations and EU agencies to try to coordinate the respective activities of these bodies .
economic analysts estimate that poor mental health costs the citizens of the European Union around three to four per cent of GDP , mainly as a result of falling productivity and early retirement .
given that Greece also has a very high level of unemployment , almost non-existent provision for training and the lowest education spending in the EU , factors which are directly linked to poverty , does the Commission consider that it is possible meaningfully to address the basic causes of poverty merely by giving social assistance to the poor ?
this compromise paves the way for new proposals for the liberalisation of the remainder of the railway system , namely passenger services .
with this in mind , as you yourself underline , the policy of distributing information in all of the Union &apos;s languages is something that we need to continue and build on further .
I feel it is appropriate , if some countries encounter difficulties while acting on their own , to have them included in areas and problems with a significantly transnational dimension .
declarations that Europe and the USA are committed to a two-state solution , which includes a sovereign and viable Palestinian state , are not really worth the paper they are written on unless we say &apos; stop &apos; to Israel in relation to settlements .
5 . Since this is a PPP project , Parliament is willing to undertake financial guarantees and to share liabilities ( but of course only when it is familiar with the concession contract and able to discuss this issue ) .
it is important to talk about both successes and problems , because this is a way of securing even greater recognition for cohesion policy and eliminating future problems .
I have personally taken this on during the course of this project , and I think I can say that I truly consider it to be an absolute priority .
why is that ?
I voted in favour of this resolution because I feel that the European Parliament &apos;s contribution to the debate on how money from the EU budget should be distributed in future ( 2014-2020 ) , and which areas should be financed to help Europe recover following the global crisis , is particularly important .
as a result of that accident , three young people lost their lives .
as a result , the right to seek asylum may be undermined , especially since refugees often have difficulty obtaining passports and visas .
at a time which everyone senses is decisive , what useful message can we Europeans send out to the peace process today ?
two groups of people are attracted to these : adults who , because of the free market , are at the mercy of social insecurity and tension and young people who want to explore all that is risky and forbidden .
of course chemical compounds still need to be submitted to scientific tests .
obviously , in the interinstitutional agreement we have made some progress in asking Member States to have national declarations .
allow me one last sentence , Mr President - Barack Obama only became President by the will of the nation , a nation which is worth working with , a nation which protects values that are also important to us .
I would now call on this House to have an inquiry into the workings of the OSCE .
thank you all , and keep up the good work !
however , I can tell you that no attentive newspaper reader can fail to be aware of what is at stake .
we also consider the procedure undertaken by the Commission to be very serious , procedure that involves the European Parliament directly . This constitutes a very important fact , significant progress .
the report presented by the Commission on 20 December 2007 concerning &apos; current practices with regard to the provision of information to patients on medicinal products &apos; indicates that Member States have adopted divergent rules and practices with regard to the provision of information on medicinal products , resulting in a situation where patients and the general public have unequal access to this information .
besides , it is quite obvious that there is never unanimous agreement over abortion in this Chamber .
while the Commission welcomes the own-initiative report as a valuable overall contribution to the discussion in terms of the individual statements and recommendations put forward , there are only a few we can wholeheartedly endorse .
what is happening in Russia at present is extremely worrying .
the threat of job losses and the shaky state of our economies make it hard to know whether one should support employer or employee groups , the positions of which are inherently opposed .
I believe it is a good thing , and that it will in future be important , that Europe should take on a certain leadership role in this area , that we should use regular conferences within Europe as a means of affirming our commitment to this and , as soon as possible , come up with feasible strategies and objectives , with a definite timetable .
the main problem I should like to re-examine in this context is that of the procedural method .
 
they see the delicate balance of the welfare state dangerously compromised and are still looking in vain today for a continental dimension to those solutions the individual nations cannot provide .
in the long term , we would avoid export subsidies and border controls , and compensation to farmers for environmental and nature conservancy initiatives , which are valued by our people , could be increased .
Members pointed out some issues that needed to be clarified and will have to be monitored in order to reach our common aim : having a well-functioning supervisory system that is capable of doing its job properly .
I am less convinced about the involvement of the Member States .
secondly , because we prefer the concept of shared responsibility .
for which aspects is it competent ?
since I share this view , the presidency will try to include the EU ’ s absorption capacity in the conclusions .
.
they have to be signed by a certain number of people , for example 500 thousand citizens .
in this regard , determined implementation of a policy to provide patients with recombinant factors is more necessary than ever in Europe .
that is why we obviously want to take individual steps , but without a thorough reform of the political system in Argentina , but also to some extent in Brazil , this continent will not shake off the crisis .
there are a number of specific steps , which can and must be taken .
the same applies to enlargement .
the fact that Russia ’ s economic growth is closely tied to the rise in energy resource prices on the world market , and has not been accompanied by social and economic reforms , does nothing to engender confidence in longterm and stable growth in that country .
this can be seen worldwide and I need not give recent examples of it .
question No 33 by ( H-0573 / 00 ) :
Mr President , congratulations to the rapporteurs and Commissioner Papoutsis , who has not had an easy task here .
in addition , CE marking must in my view become more than pure self-regulation by the industry .
lastly , in the present case , even the advertisement for the theme park explains how to find the location from abroad .
the Commission also called upon Israel to provide the conditions required for such a mission .
our rights must be further extended .
my first concern is related to the highly alarming ecological situation of the Baltic Sea , where environmental and toxic hazards are often up to five times higher than in the North Sea area .
in view of this I would like to ask the Commission to pay special attention to the specific problems faced by island territories , for which maritime transport is of particular importance .
it would be better if the future of Europe was entrusted to elected representatives who can be dismissed from office at elections and not to nominated bureaucrats in the form of Commissioners .
and there must be no repetition of the failure to distribute all the translations of all the reports in all the official languages of this House , because of lack of translators or lack of time .
just a 0.5 % tax on this currency speculation would be enough to cancel the debts of all poor countries .
Mr President , I wish to point out one remarkable characteristic of the vote that is currently in progress .
I think that that is a pity and is in danger of delaying more resolute work for equality within the European Union .
a BBC poll shows 55 % want to leave the EU and 84 % want the UK to keep its powers .
( applause )
Parliament has proved itself capable of making such policy .
officials such as Mr Legras or Mr Mansito even obstructed the work of the Committee of Inquiry , although they , as the head and deputy head respectively of Directorate-General VI , bear immediate responsibility for the defects that were discovered .
these values , however , are the result of a political compromise between states , and the results of the model used by the Commission have been overlooked .
if he does agree , will he do something about it ?
could you answer that before I make my other remarks ?
this disaster shows that the Barnier report on the creation of a European civil protection force - EuropeAid - makes perfect sense and would enable us to develop a more effective response to disasters .
( the President cut off the speaker and asked for order in the House )
countries would indeed be foolish to rely too heavily on their neighbours for energy supplies .
without redoubling and combining efforts to eradicate corruption in the wood sectors of the producing countries , the measures intended to halt the trade in illegally sourced timber associated with the clandestine exploitation of forests will have no impact .
I very much welcome the rapporteur &apos;s efforts to propose an approach which actually makes the directive enforceable and practicable and thus into an effective instrument in the fight against organised crime .
one effective way of promoting the intermodal image of short sea shipping lies in the business-oriented work of short sea promotion centres .
I am sad to have to make that point again so soon .
the environment is altogether too important to be left to the Left .
above all , the Commission itself reacts understandably with great reserve on that point .
Mrs Sinnott , the agreement will also benefit regional airports by opening up new opportunities with the elimination of the existing restrictions .
it is absolutely clear that the ruling political class , the President included , is capable of anything in order to reinforce its power , and , and in so doing , does not even balk at taking the path of ethnic cleansing .
it is not about power , but about taking responsibility .
( ES ) Mr Rodríguez Zapatero , last September , the Commissioner , Joaquín Almunia , appeared in Parliament before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
6 . Simplification of the regulatory environment ( vote )
how can we explain the Lisbon Treaty to our citizens ?
in writing . - ( PT ) We abstained from the vote on account of the fact that it is entirely up to each Member State to make the sovereign decision on whether or not it wants to join the Eurozone .
security , the first fundamental public freedom , is no longer guaranteed in European towns , the scene , since the 1970s , of drugs , muggings on trains , in the streets , on public transport , cars set alight , schools vandalised , murderous new crimes , lawlessness in the suburbs , town centres emptying and fear seeping in and taking over .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , bringing the applicant countries of central and eastern Europe up to the political and economic standards of the EU is essential if , in the long term , we are to allow these states to join the EU without at the same time damaging the legitimate interests of the Member States .
the credibility of the Structural Funds among Europeans is at stake .
the European Commission has already introduced such a register , and the European Parliament is therefore only extending its application to MEPs , officials and other staff of the European Parliament .
it requires that public monopolies are not replaced with private monopolies and above all it requires -and I address this to the Commission - the realisation of the proposed framework directive safeguarding services of general interest .
the sad fact is that this Directive is being implemented in Ireland by the Irish Government by charging schools for water usage .
by placing the emphasis on mobility , the report highlights the importance of training people whilst taking into account various experiences and methods that are specific to each Member State .
from an agricultural perspective , it would be extremely beneficial if this directive were adopted .
most of the treatment plants that have already been built were completed thanks to Community cofinancing , either from the Cohesion Fund or from the ERDF , under integrated Mediterranean programmes , successive Community support frameworks or Community initiatives .
it is similarly crucial to deliver access to high-quality , free , public healthcare services for all throughout the EU , which is not the case as things stand , due to the macroeconomic approach of the Stability and Growth Pact .
Mr President , in reality the draftsperson of the opinion was our colleague , Mrs Wallis , for whom I am a very unworthy replacement , since she cannot attend today .
it is a clear signal to consumers that the only way in which they can be certain of steering clear of GMOs is by buying organic products , especially when you think of all the animal products whose labels will not state whether GMOs were used in the animals &apos; feed .
in general , however , I would like to call for the need for strong and ongoing condemnation of brutal violations of women &apos;s rights .
we should therefore support the compromise on Article 6 which requires that after a five year period the Council of Ministers should consider whether it is still necessary to keep data on people who are granted refugee status .
what we are discussing tonight has been following that set of rules .
that would be inconsistent in the light of our criticism .
what are normal religious activities ?
the first question - do we need to harmonize resale rights - can clearly be answered in the affirmative .
I am glad and proud that , with the important exception of Cyprus , where settlement talks are still ongoing , nearly all our ambitions have materialised .
what Europe ?
I am very proud that Poland has joined the countries where parity is a legal requirement , and that it is the first of the new Member States to introduce this significant change .
since 1990 , according to Amnesty International , no other country anywhere in the world has executed so many minors .
he is refusing to accept lawyers appointed by the tribunal , whom experience has shown to favour the prosecution .
therefore it is right and proper that the European Parliament , as the highest democratic institution in the European Union , should draw attention to this fact and put forward possible measures .
for the reasons already mentioned in connection with the SWIFT agreement , I oppose the transfer of data , in particular if the constructive use of these data cannot really be demonstrated or if the misuse of the data cannot be ruled out .
of course much more can be done , but equilibrium between the environmental , socio-economic and recreational functions of the European forest can be promoted along these lines .
that attitude is changing but , as I know from my limited experience in European affairs , this will obviously take time .
how much bigotry is going to be caused by this inevitable consequence ?
for the increase in the Yugoslavian envelope to take place there will have to be a transfer of funds from the EU budget reserves to the Guarantee Fund , although the increase in the envelope cannot be implemented in full during the current year .
the second is that account must be taken of the need to improve the living conditions of coastal communities in the context of the various priority intervention areas defined within this cooperation strategy .
now , I am convinced that this reason originates in a healthy concern , in good intentions on the part of the Commissioner and Members , but we must be very vigilant about this aspect , because there is the risk that we will be starting a process that will delegitimise our democratic institutions , made up of elected members , governing bodies , assemblies at municipal and local level ; in short , the system of democratic guarantees that are the only supreme guarantees able to fully represent citizens ’ interests .
we have all received the circular from Mr Sterckx and his friends .
I therefore ask for your support .
my group will vote in favour both of the committee &apos; s proposal and of all the compromise amendments we arrived at in these negotiations .
Mr President , I want to congratulate Mr Megahy , Mrs Banotti , the Committee on Petitions and its chairman , Mr Newman , for their creative work .
only then will Europe be able to make a virtue of need .
its main points are extremely important : to update the levels of liability for the carriers , recognizing the lower risks involved in air travel today but the higher level of damages paid to victims in transport accidents .
who monitored the research protocols , especially those funded by governments , so that today we can say with certainty that those experiments were carried out only with animals ?
Mr President , Commissioner , links with neighbours are extremely important to both people and countries .
I think that what has happened clearly shows that the commitments Mr Obiang gave to Mr Prodi have not been met .
with regard to coccidiostats - substances used to prevent coccidia infections - the proposal contains stricter rules for their authorisation and placing on the market .
that is what I wanted to clarify in relation to Mr Teverson &apos;s question .
for the Latvian language , it is not possible , as small as we are , as few in number as we are .
we cannot put a stop to this trade by amending immigration and asylum policy and the legalisation of prostitution .
in fact , quite the opposite is true , as he refused to cooperate with France and Great Britain .
in truth , the values of peace and social justice were , in that short century , threatened not only by Stalinism , but equally by colonialism , by imperialism , and by neo-liberalism : from Algeria to Vietnam , from the shelling of Belgrade to the massacres of Sabra and Shatila , up to the events of 11 September 1973 in Santiago del Chile .
together we have to find the right mix in order for them to develop more and more .
with regard to Norway and Iceland , the Regulation will also only be applicable , via the Dublin II Regulation and Schengen Acquis , once they have given notice that they accept its content and are incorporating it into their national legal systems .
however , this will not be possible without tough decisions .
those now talking of the need for military strikes are dangerous warmongers .
I agree with you that these reports are a way to improve transparency , a means of helping to ensure the democratic control of Community activities .
we must not forget that sport contributes to forging an identity and bringing people together , as well as uniting sportspeople and spectators by offering the latter the opportunity to identify with their nation .
I will just say here that I would like to see some rethinking of the Cohesion Fund as soon as possible so that in the near future it is not eliminated but regionalized .
we need more studies and more comparable statistics , because these are useful for monitoring activities , making comparisons between Member States , showing how EU funds are used , helping develop best practice , and also for assessing and developing tourism programmes for those categories of people on low budgets .
intravenous drug use inevitably results in social exclusion , as it soon excludes the essential elements of normal life - work , family , personal relationships and a permanent home .
however , the efforts to modernise this country must continue .
efforts must now , therefore , be channelled into ensuring that the necessary implementing measures are transposed into national law , and , in particular , that the operation is monitored , transparently and effectively , for a certain amount of time .
the third matter which also received a lot of attention was social services of general interest .
the directive on cross-border healthcare that is due to be put to the vote today is a revolution , and I welcome that .
I agree with Mr Kofoed .
a modified Commission proposal would be good for the environment , strengthen the internal market and improve competition .
it is not by adopting this kind of overcautious attitude that we are going to resolve the problem of illegal immigration ; nor is this the way to avoid secondary movements of asylum seekers , which is nevertheless one of the main objectives of this directive .
on the issue which Mrs Flautre and Mrs Vergiat were touching upon , the advanced status of Tunisia , I consider that priority should be given to the continuation and reinforcement of dialogue with Tunisia .
so we do not need a European PNR system : we will get it by the back door .
even though we all believe there are details that are not quite perfect , we must adopt a global perspective and take the opportunity that now exists and that many previous speakers have said will not perhaps be there again .
whilst the agreement currently under discussion does reduce - at long last - some of the economic injustices suffered by Europe in the past , in a way it ignores the challenges of the future .
the report also highlights the importance of the expertise which civil society makes available to institutions and emphasises the role and significance of functions for informing and raising awareness involved in civil dialogue .
( the sitting was suspended at 1.35 p.m. and resumed at 3.05 p.m. )
as you know , last Thursday , the Opel Trust , in which General Motors ( GM ) and the German authorities have equal representation , announced that it has approved the sale by GM of a majority stake in its European Opel / Vauxhall operations to the consortium of Magna International and Sberbank .
the proposal requires lobbyists to behave fairly and honestly .
we are pleased with those two points , but my group is less pleased with what is missing from the resolution .
recalling again the words of the French President , we must think very hard , once more , about how we structure this emission trading scheme .
nevertheless , we have managed to table joint amendments in some fields .
making a commitment to simplifying the MEDA programme , making it more flexible and increasing the number of policies for the endogenous development of the Mediterranean countries are vehicles for change raised in this report which warrant our full support .
as I said , the European Parliament wants an agreement and we have put the details of what we would like in the resolution that has found the broad support of this House , certainly of the leading groups in this House .
it was quite unfair that , of all people , John Tomlinson should have been singled out .
in writing . - I voted for this report .
let us judge the regulation in the long term , as this will obviously allow us to develop its mechanism .
Mr President , the annual economic report is an excellent opportunity for Parliament to have some input in the overall economic policy guidelines .
subject : Alternative energy research and development fund
I think that we are close to the point where we can even start talking about an agreement on creating an EU energy community .
this church houses the international memorial for civil maritime navigation .
( FR ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank you for your words of sympathy and solidarity .
following a propaganda war between a newcomer and the existing company , operating different rates and using different trains , this newcomer was first taken over by a large French water company and subsequently ceased all activity .
Sri Lanka ( debate )
Mr President , Commissioner , as the information society has begun to use new technologies in trade , one of the problems that has emerged is the need to establish a system of general legal guarantees for supranational transactions made on open access networks .
there are at least two good reasons for doing so : firstly , in the years of deliberations on this matter , the views of the House have generally prevailed ; and , secondly - and more importantly at present - any amendment could jeopardize the qualified majority in the Council .
of course the nature of our societies has changed dramatically over these years , economically , socially and technologically .
it is quite simply unacceptable that the government of North Korea should use its own money and money sent to it from elsewhere to develop nuclear weapons at the same time as it relies on the world community to supply its starving population with food .
Mr President , let me , at the outset say that our group is entirely in favour of Mr Pirker &apos;s report .
to give a straightforward answer to your question : yes , we are making progress .
it took more than eight and , indeed , almost nine years for us to get the new treaty and the same number of months for us to get the new Commission .
I refer to the fact that the European Union is being treated like an economic club , the sole aim of which is to develop the common market .
it is good to see that industry is back on Europe &apos;s agenda .
at last , a more important European presence in Africa should transform from intention to reality .
I would also like to say that many infringement actions derive from notifications given by companies and point out that , within the scope of the broader consultation opened up by the Green Paper on public contracts , that gave rise to a further 300 contributions , one aspect much taken into consideration is that which seems to make the notification of things going wrong more effective .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( PT ) Mr President , we feel that the problem with the measures decided by the Council is that they are overdue , that they will have a limited impact and that they fall short of what is needed in a sector that has a good future ahead of it and that is very important to Portugal and the EU .
the Commission removed it after the first reading .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , as this report emphasizes , the Internet is extremely important in terms of citizen participation in public life .
if substances , such as pesticides , that have been banned in Europe are found in the residue quantity test , then the product is illegal .
just before the end of April , the Commission , the Council and Parliament agreed to transfer ECU 500m in commitment appropriations for structural actions from 1998 to 1999 ; and , as the Commission stated , this will not endanger the effective implementation of the programmes .
I would like to finish off by thanking the two rapporteurs , Mr Costa Neves and Mrs Buitenweg , for their positive contributions .
I also believe that the flagship train , namely the TGV that will link Paris to Luxembourg as from next year , which absolutely must be ...
without wanting to anticipate the report the Commission is due to present at the end of this year , I believe I can say one thing , which is that positive effects are indeed starting to emerge .
the UK government has acted at all times in accordance with the wishes of the Council .
the others were continuations or amended versions of initiatives taken in 1994 .
some factors undoubtedly harm employment levels : the pay gap , which certainly does not make those women who do not need to go to work enthusiastic about doing so ; and the need for lifelong training , particularly for older women who , like older men , are among those excluded from the workplace .
we support the proposal for making it simpler to move money between different categories of expenditure in the EU budget .
in this connection , the Commission will carry out an investigation into risk management instruments in agriculture , the findings of which will be available in the next few months , and they are bound to be the subject of intense discussion in this House thereafter .
it also contains a number of good concrete proposals for strengthening the role of the National Parliaments .
in the case of bananas , the EU is not being permitted to grant a trade concession to small countries which used to be its colonies - the ACP countries - where bananas represent the mainstay of their economies .
yesterday , for instance , during the vote , 39 reports were dealt with in one and a half hours which is probably something of a record .
we have failed miserably in the European Union to put in place a proper legal framework to allow that money to be utilised alongside the public funding that is available .
President of the Commission , do you envisage that at the forthcoming European Council meeting the governments can get together – perhaps we do not have the capacity and powers in the Treaty to force them – to make a sort of intergovernmental agreement to decide to invest in the next two to three years in the goals you have recommended in your papers and recommendations ?
in Italy , as Mr Vecchi told us , LIT 30 billion have been collected from the public and EUR 150 million is available : we would like to know what is the precise extent of the existing needs .
the resolutions to be adopted today send a clear signal of those directions in which Parliament expects action from the Commission .
( PL ) Mr President , today we approved a report in which we carried out a review of the functioning of the European Union &apos;s common market .
it is important to ensure that the development and deployment of ICT-based &apos; intelligent vehicle systems &apos; is increasingly accepted at international level , and the need remains to ensure that Member States and industry encourage and support investment in such systems .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I was wondering why the UK Presidency wanted to fast-track this directive at all costs .
but we must never forget that this is just a possibility .
through the ECI , EU citizens can appeal directly to the European Commission to initiate a legal act .
the report on competition policy further stresses the Commission &apos; s confidence in hard and fast rules instead of putting the emphasis on economic arguments regarding efficiency , which affects competitiveness .
travel agents use displays , screens , to display CRS information and therefore it is vital that travel agents receive neutral and balanced information .
the debate is closed .
this is not just about the development of a common market ; it is also about our commitment to the global problems associated with trade and trade policy and with our relations with the new economic powers known by the acronym BRIC .
that is clear and , before any other solutions are implemented , this element of certain regressive features must be solved .
the environment in which Member States and Members of this House come to judge the market economy status of China will be helped and encouraged by China doing more than it is at the moment to open its markets to our exports and to others ’ trade , to make sure that it is in full compliance with its WTO accession commitments , and to make sure that where it is taking longer than is reasonable to move towards full compliance with those commitments and WTO rules it makes the necessary changes sooner rather than later .
it was noted that the Member States are currently reflecting on this since it poses a certain number of practical and technical problems , and it was therefore agreed - and the Commission offered to do this - to proceed to an informal exchange of opinions with the Member States .
and when will you enter into a concrete agreement with us so that we can implement a consolidated strategy to exploit all the economic potential of Europe &apos; s countries as well ?
Mr Nitras , as regards complex financial instruments , we need stronger supervision .
politically speaking , we are in favour of closer relations between the EU and countries bordering the Mediterranean . However , a concept such as Euro-Mediterranean citizenship , which has no legal basis , could lead to legal confusion .
I am talking about a serious interinstitutional problem , since this Parliament is not undergoing a codecision procedure , it is not tabling amendments . We do not have that option .
that is wholly unacceptable .
in other words , we must be sure that what we do will be effective , but I can assure you that every country is 100 % behind those who have shown that there is another side to Belgrade apart from what President Milosevic has shown us .
however , from the European spirit which infused your speech here in Parliament , I can see that you are also looking ahead .
in this sense , thank you .
these are a few of the considerations justifying my vote in favour of approving this resolution .
first , I am also in this programme . I asked if it was correct that despite the protection of privacy rules all Members of this Parliament were to be filmed .
my group is , of course , aware that a report on the transportation of radioactive materials is not a report on nuclear power as such , but the best way to maximise safety would be if there were nothing to transport .
I consider this unacceptable .
in view of the fact that the report on the institutional aspects of accession by the European Union to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms presents provisions which are in accordance with the above remarks , I decided to vote for its adoption .
both within Europe and more widely , we are facing an upsurge in violent attacks targeting migrants , refugees and asylum-seekers , as well as minorities such as the Roma .
we have to take account of the fact that there is an unholy and unhealthy relationship between developmental problems in Africa and conflict .
no lessons have been learned from the &apos; mad cow &apos; crisis . And all over again , the Commission is setting itself up as the defender of economic interests which are not those of the Member States of the Union .
however , the EU holds a general position regarding projects which we , as the EU , would like to see realised .
they know that the emancipation of history is only possible through a project of political sharing and global justice .
furthermore , the strategy for sustainable development , which is going to be taken up for discussion in Gothenburg , will be severely compromised if the EU does not take a coordinated grip on these energy issues .
so the Council is not willing to go further in its assessment than is the case today .
I would also like to thank him straight away for co-sponsoring my amendments to ask the Commission and the UK Government to look for an opt-out , especially on the transport of live horses to the continent for slaughter .
it is to the credit of Slovakia that the completion has gone ahead not only with their own national engineers and with the assistance of the Russian designers but also with the involvement of Siemens , EDF , Westinghouse and Framatome , all western experts in the nuclear field .
we believe that aid for socially oriented projects will be more carefully and efficiently distributed if it remains under the control of governments and local authorities .
considerable efforts are still needed before we are prepared .
treating our own experience in Europe with complete disregard , you seem to want to force through a global patchwork rug of alliances between states founded solely on economic considerations , and so , by not giving your partners even the first chance to find common social and political ground , you are putting European businesses at a massive competitive advantage .
as the honourable Member is aware , what is known as the &apos; Everything but arms &apos; Regulation was adopted by the Council on 26 February 2001 , when freedom from duty , without any quantitative restrictions , was extended to include all products , except for weapons and ammunition , originating in the world &apos; s 49 least developed countries .
Mr President , I voted for both of these reports and I am happy that the House has adopted them with such a large majority .
I urge Members of this Parliament to support me on this vital issue for the farming industry throughout Europe .
the fertility of this land is greatly diminishing .
nevertheless , I must make it clear that all these actions will , of course , have to take into account the principles agreed at the Helsinki European Council concerning applicant countries , so that those applicants can cooperate and also be associated as quickly as possible with this project of creating an area of freedom , security and justice .
if , therefore , we acknowledge that upholding the current status quo for a long time to come could harm the much-needed development of this sector , we must also accept that this proposal alone will not eliminate or reduce existing distortions of competition , especially given the diversity of VAT rates still being applied in the Union .
he is responsible for Parliament ’ s lack of power , and industry will be grateful to him .
I am sure that we will also rise to the new challenge we face : laying the foundations for the smart , green economy of the future .
I also have a case concerning Mr Hörchner , another Dutch national .
in Cumbria , where the outbreak was spreading out of control , we told the farmers that they would have to slaughter even healthy animals in a preventative cull .
in this context , it would be interesting to hear whether the Council is still of the opinion that the question of the Tobin Tax is a national debate which has no place in this Parliament .
after branded products and cigarettes , counterfeiting has spread to the medicine market , and the seven million medicinal products seized each year account for around 5 % of all counterfeits .
no-one has told us why the political integration of Europe has been sacrificed to numbers and to the will of bankers , such as the Frenchman , Mr Trichet , who is a candidate for the first President of the European Central Bank and whose name , coincidentally , means &quot; cardsharper &apos; in his language .
if it is to remain meaningful , this strengthening of the second pillar must preserve the milk quotas which have proved their effectiveness in safeguarding mountain stock farming .
Mr President , this report makes it possible for the European Parliament to debate the ASEM process and comment on its results .
unfortunately , amongst these opponents of advanced technology are also colleagues from groups and countries which are usually in the vanguard of any initiatives to protect water and the environment and cannot go far enough .
Madam President , according to General Morillon &apos;s report , there is a desire for the European Union to militarise and furthermore let the advocates of peace pay for it .
so , Mr Titford , it was not the European Union that had a problem with foot-and-mouth disease : it was the UK Government .
it was only on this condition that my group agreed to the compromise .
we have a responsibility to lead the world in producing more , not less &apos; .
now we want to consolidate the substance of the negotiations achieved so far .
we are working closely with all the parties concerned in order to provide this clarification .
the Commission neither wishes , for political reasons , nor is able , due to organisational shortcomings , to fully implement the budget .
therefore , we would like a budget that restores citizens &apos; confidence not only in financial institutions , but in each other , and in solidarity on a European scale as well .
I recently returned from a visit to Ukraine , during which I met a number of people , and concerns of this nature are frequently voiced in the country .
it is a mega-player in its region and has enormous potential . Were it to disintegrate , the implications for its neighbours would be catastrophic .
Madam President , the Europe 2020 strategy is supposed to help generate economic growth in a way which will also counteract social exclusion .
and lastly , how can staff mobility between institutions be encouraged if Parliament and the Commission have different career structures ?
the first part gives autonomy , guarantees , visibility , transparency and unanimity to the rules governing the Members of the European Parliament and to Parliament as a whole .
to that we have to add other issues , such as how we can compensate for additional imports from the least developed countries merely by cutting back our own production , for sugar consumption in Europe is not going to increase .
we all know the ways of the market .
saying that the two sexes are like chalk and cheese , however , is a distortion of reality .
I am thinking not least of the only minority people in the EU , the Sami in northern Scandinavia .
we must also take greater account of the sustainability of services .
this richness and diversity are the source ultimately not of the problems , but of the innovative solutions to the problems .
Mr President , I would like to add my thanks to Louise McVay , to the rapporteur , and also to my two colleagues from the region , Mr Helmer who is here today and will be speaking later on , and to Mr Heaton Harris who also followed this matter very closely .
the proposal implies no cost for Parliament and it is clearly not at the expense of the implementation of the other official languages of the new member countries .
we in this Parliament are prepared to make our contribution by keeping to the timetable .
at the same time , I am glad for this opportunity to point out that all substantive and adjectival rules , human rights and the rule of law are complied with to the highest degree in Greece , as I believe they are in the United Kingdom .
we in our society have become dependent on the supply of oil and gas , products supplied to a large group of consumers by a small group of producers .
I hope so too , Mr President , and I believe that when I explain it , it will be easy to understand , particularly for somebody as intelligent as yourself .
you said you would reflect on further action you would take .
but we live in a world of hazards ; our cities have chemical factories across the board , all of them present huge potential risks , but we manage those risks , we live with them .
strengthening election observation missions through greater cooperation between the EU and the OSCE , and by sending us MEPs to the areas in question , will lead to a strengthening of the Union &apos;s foreign policy .
the fact that it has been introduced on an equal footing is a cause of satisfaction for us and I would essentially like to thank the Commission , the Commissioner and Marie Claude Blin , for their efforts in reaching this agreement ; I would also like to thank the Council , which has worked hard so that we may reach this agreement , as well as all the shadow rapporteurs from all the political groups , who have moved forward so that this agreement would be possible at second reading and so that we would resolve an issue which presented us with a serious problem : combating fires .
the report also pays attention to the candidate countries .
only later did it table its draft decision to the Council and to Parliament .
sometimes we vote until one o &apos;clock , other times until a quarter past or half past one .
Djibouti is one of the countries covered by the Lomé Convention , and we should regard this as a contract between us and point this out to the other countries involved .
a separate financial instrument must be created that allows compensation to be granted in every instance where restrictions have been imposed as a result of Natura 2000 sites being designated .
as a result of all this , we need a range of information and it is of course essential that Parliament can do its work , and that it can do this at a very early stage .
we have asked Coreper , that is to say the ambassadors of the Member States , to agree on a baseline document .
we cannot pressurise our Member States .
secondly , if we look at the agenda for this week , we see that the agenda for Monday evening was free .
I should point out that the proposal for Serbia for the year 2001 makes provision for a fixed sum of 40 million .
I believe we have all found her to be a very competent person .
what I am calling for is a mood of resilience and an ardour to implement the EU regulations and the tough controls that we have in place , and for us to work together to improve the inspection regimes in all Member States .
scientific ambiguities , especially where the risk of dissemination is concerned , and deficiencies in legislation and in the application of international agreements are both factors which justify a moratorium .
the right of Maltese citizens to vote in general elections depends on their nationality , age , and place of residence .
at the beginning of this debate , we would like to say that we want a good partnership with the Americans , in particular , when it comes to combating terrorism .
the ASEM process , preferably enlarged to include a country such as India , must be more than a discussion forum .
this trend deserves our attention and must certainly be included in fresh theatre policy , for it indeed pertains to a typically European task in the field of innovation .
furthermore , with regard to Lisbon – and I have seen this during this morning ’ s discussion – there is clearly a very broad consensus on a system to enhance governance , in which there is a better distinction between the competences of the Union and the competences of the Member States .
it is , therefore , absolutely essential to have a European instrument that makes it possible to combat racism and xenophobia .
approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
I can but make an appeal - hinted at in the report &apos;s resolution - naturally , the majority view prevailed - that the authorities in the Member States , and all men and women of good will should take into account the implications of the fact that Islam is now clearly the second religion in our societies .
however , as I said when answering a previous question , we still have a long way to go .
they do not reflect the detailed and factual assessments that the committee has voted on .
indeed , the latest figures show that we are on target to reach only 9 % of the projected 20 % by 2020 .
yesterday , I gave the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development a comprehensive report on the Commission &apos;s deliberations , and in order to save time , I should therefore prefer not to cover that ground again now .
the proposal for the Statute , however , provides for us to have a retirement age of 60 , which is low indeed .
firstly , I would like the Commissioner to explain why there is a contrast between the treatment of horizontal restraints and vertical restraints .
the primary objective of the European Union and the governments of its Member States , be they centre right or centre left , is to safeguard the continuing profitability of the monopolies by shifting the burden of the capitalist economic crisis on to the working classes throughout the European Union .
in my opinion it is not sufficient to discuss the points stated in Nice .
nevertheless , the question still remains .
I therefore call on the Parliament , Council and Commission to agree on the 2011 EU budget as soon as possible .
apart from the fact that Member States are asking for further progress towards tax coordination , I should also like to draw attention to another point in the report . The reduction in taxes on employment cannot be linked only to the reduction in environmental taxes , as the Commission is proposing .
the difficulty lies in identifying those who are responsible for spilling these substances .
until we move forward in these areas , the cost of any compensatory damages will be borne by innocent taxpayers .
we are therefore appealing to every minister of education in the Member States to introduce a requirement for at least three hours of physical education in schools per week .
it is only in this way that we can move forward .
Parliament has set out a series of priorities that , in my view , are similar to those of the Member States and the Commission .
does the Charter not endorse human rights , enshrined in constitutional traditions and common to all Member States ?
in its proposal , the Commission retains a rate of 20 % .
Mr Van Mierlo mentioned the anti-discrimination clause .
in addition , I have to say that this increase does not imply any increase in the European Union budgets .
it is in this spirit that the Commission has considered Parliament &apos;s amendments .
however , it should be stressed that different countries coped with the crisis with differing degrees of success .
the Council does not have the right to exert any influence on this question .
I am not exactly in favour of wasting money or spending it for the sake of it , but we must ensure that we actually honour the promises we have made to our citizens and those in other countries .
for the rest , it contradicts paragraph 2 of the same document , where it is rightly stated that water is a &apos; public good &apos; to be kept &apos; under public control &apos; .
I think that we have created a Directive that will enable increased cross-border trade within Europe in the future .
the intensity with which we have debated TV issues in recent weeks shows that it is not entirely acceptable to distinguish between content and the principles we had when we first debated convergences .
we are acting on principle here and in order to achieve a result .
Mr Buzek mentioned what in fact is the most important of the Finnish Presidency ’ s priorities : innovation policy .
we must continue to fight , with the Commission , to protect the interests of consumers , so that they should only have to bear the costs of the ever-expanding , new technologies where this is necessary , and so that , similarly to roaming , consumers cannot be swindled through invoicing either .
I must , of course , also say a word about the muskrats .
the European public was seriously alarmed when the oil tanker Erika broke in half on the Brittany coast in 1999 with 20,000 tonnes of oil on board , causing enormous environmental damage , and when three years later the tanker Prestige leaked 120 tonnes of oil onto the coast of Galicia in Spain .
we have had a moratorium in place since June 2001 and the Romanian Government has formally declared that this legislation would be ready by the end of last year . According to my information , however , although it has been approved by the Council of Ministers , it has not been submitted to Parliament and is still floating around , no one knows exactly where .
therefore , we are not against the South Korea free trade agreement ; however , we do want certain paragraphs to be studied more rigorously , which we believe create unfair competitive disadvantages for certain European industrial sectors and give Korean producers an unfair advantage .
I am pleased that we are , at last , voting on them tomorrow , and I hope that the outcome will be a satisfactory one .
this is a global problem ; we thus need global responses .
but there also needs to be support for NGOs and Member State governments to raise awareness about the impact and effects of sexual violence , be it domestic , rape or human trafficking for sexual exploitation .
you must not allow the statement by the former Commissioner for Enlargement , Mr Verheugen , that there would still be no place for Ukraine in the European Union even in 20 years time , to stand .
this resolution is therefore about neo-colonialism .
although it is complex it is an issue to which we have to take a practical approach .
so we are going to have to make do with the possibilities we have .
your report offers us an opportunity to scrutinise the Union &apos;s overall policy in the field of human rights .
Mr President , I mentioned in my speech the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , of which I am a member .
as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety for the &apos; Proposal for a Council Recommendation on measures to combat neurodegenerative diseases , in particular Alzheimer &apos;s , through joint programming of research activities &apos; , I support the invitation presented by the Conference of Committee Chairs to the European Commission to submit a new proposal on these dossiers so that Parliament is consulted in a manner appropriate to its institutional role also assigned by the provisions of the new Treaty .
our Constitution &apos;s Fourth Amendment protects individuals against unreasonable search and seizures by the State , which one of our most famous jurists once dubbed &apos; the right to be let alone &apos; .
I think that the creation of a single currency will be one of the strongest bonds , not only vital if we are to have a genuine European internal market , but also if we are to bring about economic recovery , investment and create jobs .
the Commission is ensuring that work is put in hand in a timely fashion so that we are placed in a strong negotiating position from the outset .
all of this adds up to a responsible , balanced and fair package and should therefore be supported .
I would also like to say that the European Parliament &apos; s participation in the preparatory work is important in establishing coherent European Union positions on various different issues , and that the presidency therefore naturally welcomes all the various suggestions and in particular all the contributions made through the resolutions which have been presented .
this report is not only about banning exports of metallic mercury . It is also about obtaining safe storage of this dangerous substance , something that I think is very positive .
our joint fight against capital punishment or poverty is a good case in point .
and the three Community institutions must all be singing from the same hymn sheet .
given the history of the last 500 years it is simply hypocritical to claim that free trade somehow automatically generates democracy and human rights , or else it shows a cynical disregard for the problems of the people involved - not on your part , I hasten to add , but by those who have negotiated the agreement and who use the safety clause so one-sidedly .
with your permission , on behalf of my colleague , Mrs Ria Oomen-Ruijten , who is unfortunately unable to speak this evening and who has asked me to make some points for her , I should like to refer once again to the split vote that we are proposing on Article 3 ( 2 ) .
a draft is out now for a second open consultation with stakeholders .
finally , I am pleased that Tony Blair , Britain &apos;s new Prime Minister , has declared that his presidency of the European Union in 1998 will see the completion of the market as a first target .
the European Union does not impose one single model .
indeed , as the Commission is always very scrupulous with regard to compliance with the competition rules after aid has been granted , it must be equally scrupulous with regard to the consequences for employment .
is it right to consent to State-sponsored &apos; trips &apos; ?
as Mrs Grossetête has proposed , we must also list the facilities that meet higher standards .
I should also like to mention here that the Greek government immediately expressed its support and sympathy and offered help to the victims of this catastrophic earthquake , and to pass on to the European Parliament just how much the Greek people sympathise with the suffering which the earthquake caused the Turkish people and how close it has brought them once again .
finally , in the context of a rise in power of a largely American global mainstream as regards cultural leisure , it is urgent to remind the European Union and Member States of the importance of providing themselves with tools enabling them to defend and promote the diversity of European cultures and of third countries .
therefore the Korean authorities must not use international financial assistance in support of their shipbuilding industry , and the European Union must take care to ensure that the commitments made by the Korean authorities in this regard are in fact met .
whether the glass is half full or half empty .
I believe it is vitally important that we see a political breakthrough at this Vienna summit on one central issue , namely Agenda 2000 .
if Mr Cashman will excuse me , I am going to focus on the latter .
we can identify the main elements of these agreements as the concerns relating to security , passenger rights , the mutual recognition of certification and cooperation on regulation .
be assured that we in this House are fulfilling our duty by examining the agreement in the context of the laws of the European Union .
as many as 10 % of children are affected by a &apos; dys &apos; -type disability such as dysphasia , dyspraxia , dyslexia , dyscalculia , or attention-deficit disorder .
for these reasons , the Tibetan refugees in Nepal are kept under strict control at all times .
but we also feel that the results of the summit fell considerably short of what was possible and indeed desirable .
would you agree that , if the Council had strongly and convincingly presented this problem to the Russian side , demonstrating that the EU is serious about such a scandalous violation of justice , economic relations would also have been on a better footing today ?
Mr President , I want to refer to the Commission proposals on the budget line to promote the CAP .
the Commission , the Council , the Member States should make a greater effort to promote the marketing of fair trade products .
the text of Amendment 21 , which is almost identical to Amendment 19 , reads as follows : &apos; The public service task must be assigned by way of an official act that , depending on the legislation in Member States , may take the form of a legislative or regulatory act or a contract .
in the broader context of the problems arising concerning the relationship between centres and peripheries and between metropolitan areas and small centres of population for example , the issue of urban development is becoming increasingly important .
I refer here to Directive 92 / 100 on related rights and Directive 93 / 83 on intellectual property rights in the field of cable and satellite broadcasting .
as you know , we elected the Vice-Presidents by acclaim and then held a vote to establish the order of precedence .
I should like now to refer to the financial aspects of the proposals for the reform of the common agricultural policy .
women are dying due to a lack of rudimentary medical care in clinics which have no electricity , heating or water .
Commissioner , the European External Action Service must insist vigorously that these human rights are upheld .
can you tell us what action is being taken against Member States who do not implement it properly , and what mechanisms could be put in place to help older and disabled workers to achieve their rights ?
question No 5 by Ioannis Souladakis ( H-0536 / 00 ) :
Madam President , I come with two questions for the Commissioner .
in some important industrial sectors , there are not nearly enough European standards .
Mr Schulz quite rightly pointed out that in many Member States the matter of efficiency leaves a lot to be desired and that many Member States have not yet achieved their renewable energy quotas .
to answer Mrs Koppa as well , whose speech was very sophisticated , sanctions remain a political instrument .
because the EU cannot successfully combat fraud and inefficiency , it should not increase its budget .
at the same time , failure to do so will enable the Commission to reduce the payments in 2007 .
consequently I do not understand and do not support the stance of the Polish government , which wants an exemption from the duty under the provisions of Chapter IV of the Charter , entitled Solidarity , where Polish citizens are concerned .
the European Parliament is explicitly confirming the Commission &apos;s position to guarantee a more favourable position for Portugal &apos;s interests .
for terrorism exists , fanaticism exists , injustice exists .
the Eastern Partnership goes to the very heart of the challenges we face today .
the Commissioner responsible , Jacques Barrot , has promised to present an informative report by the end of July , and our group was keen to wait for this .
however , the truth is that the population does also - and my fellow Member mentioned this just now - see negative sides to the euro .
the conference which you have organised in May with authorities from the candidate countries is a good starting point for cooperation , given that the candidate countries will have to take part in this joint exercise in two years &apos; time .
we have an interest in a balanced review aimed at maintaining the overall equilibrium which is the basis of the nuclear non-proliferation regime , and which gives equal importance to all three pillars of the Non-Proliferation Treaty , i.e. non-proliferation , disarmament and exploitation for peaceful purposes .
this is an international problem , but it has an essentially domestic solution .
the crisis in the sector requires appropriate instruments and I believe that these will be used .
I believe the European Union must grant entry to immigrants wishing to study here . It is however essential for those students to return to their countries of origin on completion of their studies .
without legislative measures in the field of warning labels and advertising bans , the alcohol strategy will be a paper tiger .
the motion for a resolution tabled by the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group is aimed at ensuring that the authorities of the Campania Region are held responsible for their actions .
the worst thing about Europe is that we always act when it is too late .
friends must speak clearly to each other ; it is with friends that we must maintain good relations and also speak very honestly .
it was , of course , not always as simple as that . With me , it never is .
the &apos; emergency procedure &apos; provided for in the guidelines for invoking the safeguard clause should now be launched , with all the categories affected being included .
Russia has realised that it must talk to the European Union if common solutions are to be reached , for example , in the matter of energy security .
this is , of course , a cause of satisfaction , but it is hard , at this juncture , not to express our regret that the single European driving licence will not come into force for another twenty-five years yet .
I listened carefully to the different evaluations concerning how Member States finally decided on Monday .
also , we had difficulties with the Council on employee rights to information .
but we have no undertaking from the Council to act within any given timetable , so we as a Parliament will have to watch that very carefully .
as we know , I regret to say that there are citizens in some states , not least Italy , who have not paid any contributions and yet receive the same sized pension as citizens who have paid a lot of contributions .
it is nevertheless important that the Convention ’ s fundamental ideas are not discarded during the work of the IGC .
the Commission fully shares the concerns about the need to address the very serious human rights situation in the country , as expressed in the joint motion for a resolution we are debating today .
consequently , at the heart of any political measure taken by the EU , not least in international fora such as the World Trade Organisation , must be the defence of labels and other protected designations , as this is the only way of guaranteeing the sustainable competitiveness of European products in a globalised world .
I nevertheless share all the rapporteur &apos;s concerns about part-time work , and would add that women must equally have the right , for economic or career reasons , to choose fulltime work : for example single women with dependent children .
far too often Parliament passes amendments on important legislation with no consideration for its impact .
I should like to congratulate her on her appointment .
we are involved in trying to support it , not least administratively , as it tries to develop free trade agreements in the region .
in my previous report , adopted by the plenary meeting of this Parliament on 12 July 2007 , it was decided not to introduce the use of this abbreviation as a name but only to use those five words .
assuming that the experts are correct in forecasting huge increases in the price of oil , we must assume that even more risky exploration for oil will take place in the foreseeable future .
it seems a good idea to me to take another closer look at this .
this is the only way to guarantee a sensible consideration of the specific advantages and disadvantages . This is also the only way that the interests of the European Union and of its citizens can both be assured .
basically , ladies and gentlemen , this is regrettable and sad .
an unspoken attempt is manifestly being made to create a state , because an organisation with tax-raising powers is effectively a state .
yes , there should be a marketing ban - a sales ban - wherever there are alternatives which have already been evaluated .
although air travel has been a relatively safe form of transport , the congestion of airports and airspace has increased the risk of accidents .
firstly , any measures taken must be based on sound scientific evidence ; secondly , they must be proportionate ; and , thirdly , they should not place a further burden of regulation , and thereby cost , on the agricultural and veterinary industries .
the situation of the Roma in Kosovo
it provides training and advice to the &apos; Integrated Police Unit &apos; , and thus helps to ensure that policing in the capital city Kinshasa is not only efficient but also compatible with the basic concepts of a modern state under the rule of law .
.
one of the strengths of the Union is its diversity .
that is why I am very surprised by the comments made by both Mr Baudis and Mr Michel , which seem to be encouraging you to ignore this aspect of our relationship and our cooperation with Tunisia , and to ultimately abandon Article 2 of the association agreement .
. ( FR ) Mr President , I feel that I should respond , because Mr Liese asked a specific question during the debate .
from a social and political point of view , it is when violence causes concern that the problem arises .
that is the conclusion that I , at least , take from this debate .
the Kiev Protocol on Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers plays its part in helping to reduce pollution and promote sustainable development .
the June List champions the sovereignty of the nation state with regard to legal issues .
we should let European rules and regulations apply to European companies .
in particular , additional measures are required for minors .
we have been used to better things from you in the past , and I would ask you to study the statement from the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights , which is attached to this report and which we all support .
there are , however , clear indications that overfishing does play a part .
access to new information and communication technologies can be facilitated if we make room for them in schools , libraries and public centres .
the Commission has also been active in this area and has tabled proposals we regard as very interesting . These will be discussed during our presidency , when we hope , as I have said , to be able to make significant progress .
in my view , a review will be needed in future with regard to the applications to which an exemption from the cadmium ban applies .
eighty per cent were female , and child abuse domains totalled more than 3 000 .
it is important to stress that the operational role has shifted from the regions to the provinces , to allow for the development of a plan meeting the various requirements of the region .
the weapons inspectors of the first four years were not effective in disarming Iraq , but acted as an intelligence service for those states that sent and paid their experts and spies .
we , and I personally , have on a couple of occasions asked the ambassador and other Russian representatives here to allow us entry to Chechnya .
at a time when everyone acknowledges that monetary policy is an independent policy , when the political power does not have much to say and when practically all of the members of Eurogroup and ECOFIN have criticised the monetary policy when it came to raising interest rates , this appointment has not been the subject of any debate whatsoever .
this calls for urgent action by the European Parliament to monitor Serbia , not only in the Delegation to Yugoslavia , but also – and this has not happened since February – in the Committee on Foreign Affairs .
just a few months further on , however , there are circles that are busy relativising the threats by distancing Europe from the United States .
it does not take account of the cycle , it maintains divisions , it seeks to impose penalties without offering encouragement , and it is incapable of responding to the nagging problem of the very poor potential for growth in Europe .
clearly the need to organise themselves militarily to respond to this threat led to the KLA &apos; s action .
it is an essential element of the EU &apos;s influence in the standard-setting process of the International Accounting Standards Committee Foundation .
as of 2004 , these measures should become the core of the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines and the new goals for enhancing flexible management of the Stability and Growth Pact .
I believe we want absolute freedom from ethnic stigmatisation .
the events of recent days have undermined a fragile process that has just begun with the meeting of President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert in Amman .
I hope to be able to count on the support of the European Parliament in establishing the budgetary priorities that are required to fulfil the new tasks of the information and communication policy of the European Union .
at the same time as the ENVI Committee was discussing Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico , oil was escaping from the Jebel al-Zayt drilling platform , which is a few kilometres offshore in Egypt , and we learned about the leak from tourists .
in a Europe that is socially conscious , fair , evolved and cohesive , it is imperative to ensure measures that eradicate and minimise the risk of social dumping and the degradation of living conditions for its people when faced with the devastating effects of the current economic crisis .
the greatest possible number of local food producers and distributors should be involved in the implementation of programmes of this kind , since this will strengthen the position of small and medium-sized agricultural holdings .
today most of the instruments which affect employment prospects for their citizens are still in the hands of the Member States - rates of wages and social welfare , the length of hours worked and infrastructure within the individual states .
that is my belief .
there are a great number of cases in Europe in which frequency licences are not renewed and yet this Parliament has never spoken of human rights violations and curbing freedom of expression .
another high-profile event at the Summit is to be the signing of the recently-concluded , and historic , open aviation agreement between the European Union and the United States , which will - on both sides of the Atlantic - yield economic benefits estimated to amount to EUR 12 billion and create something like 80 000 new jobs .
as an example , I will refer to a principle which guided the European Community from its inception - defence of what is known as parallel trade , or trade in legal products outside official channels of distribution , for example , the sale in Germany of Grundig televisions which have been purchased legally in France .
the presence of the father and the need for the father not to be penalised if he takes leave are recognised .
fourthly , it points out the insufficiencies of information policies .
the same applies to so many modes of transport .
over 100 million EU citizens are already using complementary medicine and its popularity is growing rapidly .
this report , as passed by the Committee on Agriculture , is a balanced and integrated report and can go as it stands to the negotiating table for the preparation of the legislative text .
it is also an excellent opportunity for the Presidency to learn Parliament &apos;s opinion on this important issue .
Montreal was a success , but only in relative terms .
these employees would not benefit from the protective labour-law clauses requiring an employer to justify dismissal .
in spite of this , I believe that it is vital for moves and travel across borders within the EU to be made easier for families and individuals who are travelling with a pet .
what should we be visualising ?
let me point out that the Commission has made a proposal , which was forwarded to Parliament and the Council late last week , on reviewing the texts in force on the free movement of persons , to which point 123 refers .
unlike 1992 , nobody now contests the Commission &apos;s proposals .
we are also accused of not really being affected by the growth of the Asian markets while the USA suffers as it has to take in all the cheap products .
indeed it is fascinating that the United States , which is not a signatory to the Rome Statute , has nonetheless used its position on the UN Security Council to facilitate the ICC indictment of Bashir .
the proper distinction between austerity and the European perspective has been blurred .
we must maintain this position by ensuring , of course , that our partners , the other large countries , the large regions , adopt a reciprocal attitude .
women , who constitute more than half of the population , are heavily under-represented within political , economic and social fields .
it sets a good example for many other donors too .
this means that in terms of quantity management too , we need to put in considerable effort to ensure that life upstream and downstream is not affected by it .
now and again - and increasingly often - this House has followed our lead .
it seeks to develop new features , extend access to new authorities , interlink alerts between those authorities and introduce new categories of data , such as the arrest warrant and biometric data , and the visa information system , a technical platform for sharing information .
in the past two decades or so , many initiatives have been trialled which have been aimed at getting those from demographic groups traditionally disinclined towards university to attend third-level institutions .
I would like to thank her warmly for her excellent level of cooperation and wish her every success for the future .
I wish to urge most strongly that the WTO collaborate in full with the International Labour Organization to ensure that core labour standards are observed as was recommended in the final declaration of the 1996 Singapore Summit .
secondly , we need to develop genuine solidarity between the 27 Member States .
what is in the package ?
the House , in its wisdom , can then decide .
this is because , Mr Zapatero , Europe is more than just the sum of the domestic successes of its governments , including those that you may have had .
the first is also a specific question to Commissioner Dimas .
therefore , the agreements they might have to make on market access – market opening – may not be exactly what they need and perhaps they could get more from other kinds of arrangements .
we have decided not to undertake any new initiatives in this transitional period but to concentrate on completing the major commitments before us .
if one of the parties fails to respect its obligations and generates an influx , the whole system breaks down .
. the readmission agreements between the European Community and third countries are of key importance to the European strategy to combat illegal immigration .
( FR ) Mr President , there is a famous painting by the Belgian artist René Magritte which shows a pipe with , below it , the caption &apos; ceci n &apos;est pas une pipe &apos; .
I am delighted that Mr Barroso seems to be running on high-octane fuel and long may that continue , but the rising tide of protectionist rhetoric and protectionist actions by Member State governments is unacceptable .
in our joint motion with the PPE-DE Group we urge the proper respect of the SGP .
let us at least show the next generation that there is more to life than some of the books that are being produced and sold in all our airports .
I am in favour of &apos; naming and shaming exercises &apos; .
I am absolutely convinced that we are in a better position today to achieve these objectives than we were some time ago .
as regards the instructions , I hope that it is an exceptional case , but I am very willing to find out more , as I did not know about it .
their close cooperation has deepened further through the ongoing process of globalisation and the European countries &apos; growing demand for fossil fuels .
this means that the criteria which have to be met in other sectors of our economy have to be met in tourism as well : we need European tourism to be a product that is innovative and provides an optimum choice for consumers , that meets the highest quality standards and that is as environmentally friendly as possible .
Mr President , France is , as everyone knows , a secular state .
the enumeration of the political achievements at Montreal is truly impressive .
the influence of global warming on daily weather is obvious .
ban on use of cyanide mining technologies ( motions for resolutions tabled ) : see Minutes
if someone does not want to see the difference between Communism and Nazism , between Communists in the past and Communists in the present , who like myself represent significant numbers of Communist voters here in Parliament after democratic elections , then they are perhaps simply trying to lump me together with the Nazis .
we have judged that it is not impossible to reach the targets .
Madam President , the rapporteur Mr Lagendijk and our shadow rapportuer Mr Posselt have certainly done an excellent job .
the European Union has been incapable of playing a significant , decisive role in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict .
thank you , Mrs Bonino .
for the latter , there are the Staff Regulations of the European Communities , a very comprehensive document , which provides the staff working in the European Union institutions with adequate social protection .
it is a shame , because one just cannot see where the truth lies .
what is more , it really is extraordinary that the Commissioner , who , when it comes to other dossiers , is so resolute about safeguarding the free movement of products within the single market , is willing to present a proposal as discriminatory as this , which is to apply retroactively and for a period of ten years , up to December 2011 .
the Spectrum Decision in its present form will set up a general and permanent framework for addressing radio spectrum policy and legal issues in the context of all relevant Community policy areas .
furthermore , the number of ecopoints set relates to the current Member States , and to apply the system now to the future countries would complicate matters even further .
the implementation time , which is staggered over the period 2010 to 2015 , is also sufficiently considerate for industry .
we therefore need an integrated European response to the crisis , which will not replace or overlook the responsibilities of the Member States to keep to their word and restructure their public finances , but which will protect these economies from attacks by the markets and help to ensure that their efforts are successful .
there are some details that I must give to you , or confirm for you , which have been in evidence for three years , in other words , since I took up this position .
collating , substantiating and evaluating information from a number of countries will only help us carry out an integrated study and find basic answers if we collate and exchange data from as wide an area as possible on a comparable basis .
we are completely dependent on one another in the matter of energy , but that dependence needs to work both ways .
we roundly condemn the actions by the occupying regime , which are blatant infringements of a basic human right .
this is why I am in favour of these practicable proposals being implemented for non-profit organisations , including those engaged in educational and scientific activities .
the ENP is a fundamental element of the architecture of the Union &apos;s relations with the ring of states surrounding it .
mathematical , general and indiscriminate increases are of no use at all .
today we are discussing a vital subject which has come before our Assembly on several occasions without reaching a conclusion : should we , at European level , harmonize legal protection for biotechnological inventions , i.e. inventions acting on genes of a vegetable , animal or human being ?
 
it will be a crucial factor in the success of the strategy .
there was thus complete support in Copenhagen for Mrs de Palacio and for the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism and the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy .
we should , then , be able to have a joint debate on the issues relating to the Balkans , at the same time as dealing with the Lagendijk report on the European Agency for Reconstruction .
on the Jarzembowski report ( A4-0243 / 97 )
this premium for the abandonment of wine-growing areas is also very dubious .
it is not only in recent times , though , that reality has had a different tale to tell , and this makes it even more important that the World Economic Forum in Davos and the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre should examine , on a regular basis , the methods employed by globalisation and the effects resulting from it .
but the important thing is : I would have assumed that the Commission , given its obligations under Article 35 , would have been aware of this particular matter .
not seeking the EU interest but only focusing on the net payment position of every single Member State is what the budget is today in the European Union .
after almost two years of promises that renovation will start imminently , not one building has been renovated .
we Socialists believe that the time has at last come for culture and European citizens to play a decisive role in the building of Europe .
whilst , for example , Human Rights Watch urged the European Union not to normalise its economic relations with Cuba at least until political prisoners had been released and democratic reforms implemented , Mr Michel stated that he was in favour of an unconditional extension of the Cotonou Agreement to include Cuba .
because we have now referred the matter back to the committee , I must formally follow the rules .
what are these relationships , what are the rules of the game in this area ?
the first of these areas deals with stimulating entrepreneurial thinking among young people .
we also reminded you , through an amendment , that the Luxembourg compromise should be incorporated into all parts of the Treaty . Unfortunately , that amendment was rejected .
you have demonstrated this in your reply .
the industry is quite rightly saying that nobody needs that sort of patent : it is so exorbitantly expensive that it is of no use and practically no economic value .
in writing . - ( SV ) I did not participate in this vote on account of my special connections with the credit rating industry .
the Commission &apos;s proposal on the introduction of a reserve meets with our explicit support .
while we are not running an election campaign , we are ready to inform , to explain and to answer the questions that citizens are quite entitled to ask .
however , access to the Internet is becoming increasingly important for civil participation , media pluralism , freedom of expression and interaction with government services .
we are all trying to attend several meetings .
such countries already have access to free trade agreement negotiations , with the issue of visa facilitation on the table , along with participation in the CFSP and the SDP .
we will also play our full part in the efforts to relaunch the peace process in the Middle East , not only by giving financial support to the Palestinian Authority , which is beset by enormous difficulties , but also by trying to ensure the implementation of the Mitchell report that the European Union co-signed .
Mr President , the Commission has emphasised in its communication that enlargement of the European Union will be the core challenge of 2004 .
I regret that the Commission rejected the proposal to phase out subsidies in 1996 and instead opted for reform proposals .
at national level , on the other hand , my party , the UDC , is continually challenging the majority on this .
14 . Strengthening European legislation in the field of information and consultation of workers ( vote )
it is rather striking that the rapporteur for the next report , Mr Dell &apos;Alba , is not there either .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I take the floor to speak about the report on Romania .
written statements ( Rule 149 )
to conclude , I would like to underline that promotion of and respect for human rights across the world is one of our main priorities in external policy .
I agree with him on most points and support his proposal , although there is one area where he is being over-ambitious in my view .
let it not be thought that research is only just beginning - it was indispensable to past generations &apos; means to live and enjoy life , and indeed to those of our own generation , and that far more so than new technology would have us believe .
because in his speech Mr Solana upheld a concept of security based on militarism and interventionism , arguing for the development of a strategy assuring an early , rapid and &apos; robust &apos; intervention , when necessary , and the existence of more military resources in combination with diplomatic and civil instruments .
this situation must change and this is why we in the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance are calling for at least 40 % to go to environmentally friendly rail transport , a maximum of 20 % to the roads and at least 15 % to walking and cycling .
I am very proud that our multinational family is represented here today with three generations , including my grandmother .
China has never been tolerant of dissent or its own minorities , but I do share its concern about the threat of Uighur Islamist terrorism .
I support the Commission position . It intends to apply the Charter of Fundamental Rights in its legislative proposals until such time as this Charter enters in force .
of course we always have bilateral priorities for the Transatlantic Economic Partnership and we continue to support the idea that we need to work together on positive measures to boost bilateral trade .
I therefore welcome the Youth on the Move initiative , in particular , its aspect of supporting and encouraging student mobility , and of recognising qualifications , as well as the importance ascribed to non-formal and informal education , which are often as important as formal learning or even more so .
this has meant an increase in Parliament &apos;s responsibility , since this House has become the institution through which the ECB is now held to account before the European public
Mr President , I welcome the statement from the Commissioner .
we may not like it , but that is how things are ; it is convenient .
the fact that this is camouflaged as a war on terrorism - even if there is terrorism there - is simply a cynical distortion of reality .
Madam President , I think the European Commission has an obligation to make better use of CEDEFOP &apos;s contribution , as the rapporteur himself also said .
competition policy is key in financial services .
we must appreciate that there is a need to improve their conditions .
I believe that this is a very important matter - and I have had occasion to speak on it both here in the plenary and in various parliamentary committees - but it is wholly unrelated to the question asked by Mr Wibe . I would therefore not wish to comment any further , Mr President .
as regards sea-based missions , it gives us great satisfaction to see that Frontex &apos;s activity will increase substantially on maritime borders , especially in the centre of the Mediterranean , but also in the Eastern Mediterranean , where we have recently seen problems increase substantially .
this Regulation , as its name suggests , is more than 30 years old and has become more ambiguous as time has gone on .
for this encouraging outcome , I wish especially to thank both the rapporteur , Mr Zappalà , and the shadow rapporteur , Mrs Berger , whose input has been considerable .
I am not going to do that and will concentrate instead on a couple of key points and core themes .
the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development tabled numerous amendments , and they were mainly targeted at the timetable for implementation .
for the most part , this report confines itself to general considerations without putting forward any practical decisions .
moreover , a number of other amendments succeed in formulating provisions more precisely and eliminating contradictions .
one means of combating racism and xenophobia is to show personal courage and not to shrink back !
we are receiving and monitoring reports on the sanitary conditions in these , the lack of food and the mental and physical ill-treatment .
this may help to advance the claims of medium-sized and peripheral cities which would be unlikely to be put forward for selection if they were to rely upon being chosen by their Governments .
the more expensive a packet of cigarettes , the bigger the incentive to stop smoking .
both the criticism and the statement about the alleged failure of ICAO negotiations are incorrect and inappropriate .
what has the reform of the Commission to do with the internal market ?
to now see them in the government of my country is stomach-churning , and to find that they are there because they murdered and as a buy-off so that they will not murder again makes it even worse .
these programmes should concentrate , to a large extent , on occupations which will be important in the future and eliminate the stereotypes which exist in terms of areas of education dominated by women or men , as well as eliminating traditional models in teaching programmes .
I would ask Members to reject this report , until a study has been made of the practical implications and the cost of implementing its recommendations .
our common regulatory framework is more or less in place . MIFID is the last piece of the jigsaw where markets are integrating fast .
the third group consists of Amendments Nos 6 , 7 and 8 . With respect to the age of vessels to be withdrawn , the Commission has proposed to reduce the minimum age to five years in the case of the exporting of vessels .
furthermore , we shall be investigating ways to collaborate in building a new sarcophagus , and shutting down and dismantling the entire Chernobyl plant - which may cost a further USD 2300 million .
we are , however , sorry that Parliament has been passed over in the preparatory work until now .
the proposal submitted before you also makes provision for a port security authority to be designated for each individual port or group of ports , a port security officer to be appointed , and focal points to be set up in Member States in order to ensure that the necessary communication takes place with other Member States and , of course , with the Commission .
we must not do that and we must not create suspicion by making a fuss over the kind of ideas which should be taught at their institutions , because we shall not succeed in that .
it is these rules that will provide greater market efficiency , better social development and sufficient environmental protection .
what I believe we can do as the European Union - and it is important at this time , especially now when Abu Mazen and Ariel Sharon are continuing to talk , although both sides are acting and reacting - is to legitimise the role of Abu Mazen : in this difficult situation , the more legitimacy we give him , the more successful we will be in creating the conditions for relative peace .
it is getting ready for another military intervention in Iraq .
this is grotesque and an affront to this House but , far more importantly , it is an insult to the terrorised and starving people of Zimbabwe , whose lives and livelihoods have been destroyed by the actions of the Mugabe regime .
the existence of genetically modified crops , in conjunction with a 0.9 % limit on GMOs in honey , presupposes that bees can choose between genetically modified and non-genetically modified plants .
the British and Irish systems are very much based on the presumption of innocence , trial by one &apos;s peers , as in the Magna Carta .
these are really things which should be discussed in committee , However , Mr Bardong will say something briefly on that as rapporteur .
and I hope that Turkey takes proper note of this .
by means of simplified and accelerated procedures with regard to the development of energy infrastructure , the EU can make important progress in setting its course - although this must under no circumstances be to the detriment of citizens and it must not undermine the Aarhus Convention .
as such , the European Union is able to play an important role in promoting stability and prosperity in the Baltic region through political and economic cooperation and is doing so .
however , there appears also to have been a violation of European Union law .
school is a place for setting standards and for teaching girls and boys together . It is a place for opening horizons rather than slamming the door on future opportunities .
a proposal will be submitted in 2010 on the basis of the outcome of the consultations carried out .
I will be using my vote to condemn a Community agricultural policy that basically adheres to a rationale of reducing prices and lowering the value accorded to labour , a policy that is so destructive that it calls into question the CAP itself by proposing the cofinancing of agricultural spending .
as we have seen in the Kindermann report , intensive industrial fishing is carried out in the Baltic . Industrial fisheries use small-meshed nets and , despite protests made by Greenpeace , such activities are not subject to any particular restrictions .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
the trafficking of children and women is flourishing .
she would like to see increased proportions of participation in the labour market , especially among groups in which these proportions are below average . We are speaking about women , young people , immigrants and the aged .
this is the intention behind Amendment No 77 .
this first step was achieved thanks to the decision to which I have referred .
admittedly , Commissioner van den Broek , who is not himself responsible for competition policy , could only read out what the Commission services , or more precisely Mr Van Miert &apos;s department , had written for him .
at the same time , it is a matter of ensuring that freedom of movement is not restricted to unskilled labour ; on the contrary , the success of the common market and the people who work in it depends on a high standard of exchange among the Member States .
 
I know I cannot always say this without being punished from within my own ranks .
the assertion made by both Mr Belet and Mrs Van Brempt thus does not fit in with the timeline .
by bringing together the various actors in the field of external relations , we can ensure that our relations with the outside world are clear , coherent and driven by a single set of policy goals .
this year it is 100 years since the unicameral parliament was founded and universal suffrage established .
this Council will be where the European Union takes decisions on some fundamental issues that will map out its long term future , such as the physical introduction of the euro , the confirmation that enlargement is irreversible and the operational aspects of the European security and defence policy .
the proposed measure has a strongly preventive character .
if the Council refuses to accept these , we will review our position and convince our colleagues in the national parliaments of the fact that better protection of citizens &apos; freedoms is necessary for a fair course of justice .
this report , which I voted for , calls on the European Commission to identify the failings and provide an impact assessment on the possible alternatives , including further legislative proposals .
in October 1999 , the Tampere Summit marked an important stage , with the introduction of the mutual recognition principle .
the agreement between the PPE-DE Group , the Socialists , the Liberals and the Finnish Presidency takes one more step in the direction of bypassing any opposition and competition , in favour of the prosperity of big business .
surely , this is not something we should expect to happen .
the report welcomes certain suggestions for improving the current system , but the introduction of a definitive system is called for .
the complete separation of church and state is important , as homophobia is spreading in those areas where religion plays too great a role .
the ALDE Group will be voting against this proposal for reasons of principle . This is mainly for procedural reasons and not because we consider the contents poor , although there is much room for improvement there .
we need to mobilise actors to act .
they gave enormous help , assistance and commitment to me and Mr Roche , my Minister for Europe , who is with me today .
these statistics are not comparable between different countries and are difficult to interpret .
( Applause and laughter ) I mean comrade in the &apos; comradely &apos; way .
in brief , we need a directive which will give European television the necessary balance between quality and ratings .
so I hail the European Parliament directive which recognizes that .
Madam President , we approved the report as it is an important instrument for rewarding businesses which go further than other businesses .
Mr President , there continues to be one financial scandal after another in Russia .
the second point to which we attach importance concerns national management declarations for funds that are subject to shared management .
the total increase of payment appropriations is therefore restricted to 2 % .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to wish you a happy birthday , Mr Florenz , albeit belatedly .
several speakers this morning have spoken about the European patents .
for this reason , it will be necessary that the regulations which will govern the Structural Funds in the future , in the way expressed by the Commissioner or in an even more detailed way , will deal with implementing them positively and integrally in this common heritage , within the framework of a rigorous regional policy , with the aim of making progress in the cohesion of our regions and our peoples .
so things are making progress .
I therefore voted in favour of this report .
let me conclude by saying that I am of course very pleased with the work that has been done , and although I believe the result is certainly not perfect , it can be a very good point of departure provided , I repeat , that serious and responsible practical action is taken promptly .
the Syrian authorities are notorious for detaining civil society activists and defence lawyers in political cases , as well as participants of foreign conferences on human rights after their return home .
secondly , the Commission is also happy that Parliament has confirmed its commitment to the procedure of the amending letter on agriculture between institutions .
however , a long time ago , Benjamin Ferencz , former prosecutor at the Nuremburg War Crimes Trial , said that there can be no peace without justice , no justice without law , and no meaningful law without a court to decide what is just and lawful under any given circumstances .
furthermore , they need to look at their criminal code sections on crimes against national security to ensure that these laws cannot be applied against those merely exercising their right to freedom of expression , as well as at the administrative detention directive which allows for the detaining of individuals for up to two years .
we must provide for increasing the power of employees and their representatives in order to strengthen their right to contest the basis for the economic reasons behind their redundancy , which we shall call the Wolbert-Michelin amendment and which we shall submit for your vote tomorrow .
at some stage the rich countries will have to take the initiative to break the trend whereby the gulf between rich and poor just keeps on growing .
grassroots initiatives , which aim to raise awareness in society , as well as those which aim to help victims of discrimination , are extremely important in the fight against discrimination .
in future not only the employment guidelines but also the economic policy guidelines of the EU are to be discussed in the Standing Committee on Employment .
we have seen that where services are privatized , for example in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands , it is possible to make the post office profitable too and to provide the whole population with a good service .
of primary concern is the subsequent depletion of fish stocks , the dependence of local communities in developing countries on these stocks for their own food , the poor enforcement rules and catch limits and the apparent contradictions that seem to exist between the EU fisheries policy and EU development policy .
despite Cohesion Fund cofinancing , in most countries , investment in roads is still significantly higher than in the rail system .
in 28 % of cases , the inquiry resulted either in the institution concerned settling the case to the full satisfaction of the complainant , or in a friendly solution .
Ms Alfano , please continue .
the situation is really very critical .
a word about the reform of the institutions .
I hope that will be taken back very clearly to the Intergovernmental Conference .
in writing . - ( NL ) I have voted against this report , because this UN Human Rights Council cannot by any stretch of the imagination be considered a legitimate institution .
alas , the ongoing violence is again putting this at serious risk .
I would sincerely like to thank him for this , not least in that his proposals contain a number of points which my group considers to be important and positive .
as Commissioner Wallström indicated during the hearings in the European Parliament in September 1999 , the Commission will bring up the issue of nuclear safety and radiation protection in any relevant meeting with the Turkish Government in the future and I am happy to inform you that I will have a meeting with the Turkish Foreign Minister in a couple of days and will certainly raise the issue .
technology , products and limit values are already operating within the Union .
the analysis we have presented in the White Paper has been debated in depth , also by the industry and the sectors mostly affected .
something else that is very important is the demand for the appointment of European coordinators to be an option .
no support is given to alternative ideas , such as building nuclear power stations .
complying with fundamental rights does not prevent the adoption of effective security measures , and this has been recognised by the way in the Stockholm Programme which calls on the European institutions to ensure that all tools deployed to fight against terrorism fully respect fundamental rights .
to conclude , I must applaud the exemplary collaboration between our two institutions . Since 1996 , this has allowed a coherent information strategy for the euro to be developed .
there are so many practical ways of satisfying Russia &apos;s justified concerns .
but they did not stop there , they went on to say that each worker should have access to vocational training and upward mobility in order to adapt to economic and technological changes .
the European Union supports the development of a secure , stable and democratic Iraq , with a parliament and a government , elected on the basis of a constitution that guarantees respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the Iraqi population as a whole .
Mr President , the Socrates programme is not just a system of educational exchanges .
I really think that you are mistaken .
the important thing is that this should be an opportunity and not an imposition , as some directives have often become in the past .
on behalf of the PPE Group , therefore , I welcome the successful outcome of negotiations with China and call on the Council to put this result in political order so that the European Parliament is able to adopt this important decision .
however , I believe that most of the points of view of that committee are still covered in the report .
I shall ensure that the President , Mrs Fontaine , communicates our displeasure to the Council .
we are talking about consumer confidence and that is the most important thing .
in writing . - ( PT ) As stated in the report , full attention must be paid to sport due to its social and cultural aspects and due to the social and educational values that it transmits , such as self-discipline , challenging personal limitations , solidarity , healthy competition , respect for opponents , social inclusion , opposition to any form of discrimination , team spirit and tolerance .
I can promise you my absolute cooperation , and I will also try to move as much as possible forward at Council level , without great fanfare and proclamation , but rather in such a way as to achieve real results .
the European Council &apos;s adoption of this approach would unambiguously demonstrate that this is a common problem , to which the Union will provide a common solution .
it is important to us all , however , that we ultimately achieve a good result , and that European citizens then see that Europe does affect them , and that it is something worth fighting for .
this will help us in achieving the Lisbon objectives .
I see it as a matter of absolute priority that Europe be communicated , and we MEPs in particular , being a House of over 700 specialists , are ready and willing to do it .
A4-0430 / 98 by Mr Caccavale , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Security and Defence Policy , on Latvia &apos;s application for membership of the European Union , with a view to the Vienna European Council ( 11-12 December 1998 ) ( COM ( 97 ) 2005 - C4-0377 / 97 ) ; -A4-0428 / 98 by Mr Bernard-Reymond , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Security and Defence Policy , on Romania &apos;s application for membership of the European Union , with a view to the Vienna European Council ( 11-12 December 1998 ) ( COM ( 97 ) 2003 - C4-0375 / 97 ) ; -A4-0427 / 98 by Mr Wiersma , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Security and Defence Policy , on Slovakia &apos;s application for membership of the European Union , with a view to the Vienna European Council ( 11-12 December 1998 ) ( COM ( 97 ) 2004 - C4-0376 / 97 ) ; -A4-0431 / 98 by Mr Kristoffersen , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Security and Defence Policy , on Lithuania &apos;s application for membership of the European Union , with a view to the Vienna European Council ( 11-12 December 1998 ) ( COM ( 97 ) 2007 - C4-0379 / 97 ) ; -A4-0429 / 98 by Mrs Aelvoet , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Security and Defence Policy , on Bulgaria &apos;s application for membership of the European Union , with a view to the Vienna European Council ( 11-12 December 1998 ) ( COM ( 97 ) 2008 - C4-0380 / 97 ) .
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on 10 July 2008 .
the information collected will naturally be supplied to the Commission , the Council and the petitioner .
in particular European Union leaders recognise that it was not enough to manage the problem .
there is a common thread running through all the arrangements in this area , and that thread is the principle of universal controls , from the farm to the shop counter to the table .
I would like to make it clear that all applications submitted after 1 May this year under the proposal which is in its closing stage will be processed according to the new rules .
that will be exceptionally hard work .
we face , for example , ongoing violations of human rights .
the Commission intends to provide the necessary guidelines .
it is just not acceptable that responsibilities should be scattered among different Directorates-General with the result that no healthy , sensible legislation comes into being .
I wish to stress , therefore , the need to validate their efforts through labelling and through information campaigns to explain the reason for a price difference .
as a rule , social and youth affairs can be handled very well by Member States .
I fully agree with the honourable Members that the Partnership for Modernisation should be broadly based .
such agreements have to be in the public domain , whether multilateral or bilateral , and this Parliament has yet to receive documents promised by the Italian authorities after our visit to Lampedusa .
that is the commitment I call on Parliament and the Union to undertake .
some of my fellow Members have already mentioned this : 85 % of the certificates will be allocated free of charge , while 15 % will be auctioned .
in connection with this debate , I have received two motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37.2 of the Rules of Procedure
over the past years we have proved that we were capable of bearing our share of the burden because we knew that behind each beneficiary of Community appropriations there was also a taxpayer , and that behind both of these there was a voter .
Mr President , the power of many of these fraudulent directory companies is that they are in another Member State , so they seem untouchable unless in some way the EU intervenes .
on top of the BSE crisis , the mood in my constituency is one of near despair and this pattern is being repeated in rural areas across Europe .
I am quite amazed by your restraint . After all , you come from a country in one part of which a system of injustice has just been overcome and where general spying on citizens was the most significant feature .
and what is Mr Barroso doing , going around like a bull in a china shop as usual ?
given the fact that the economy of Moldova is being heavily hit by the negative effects of the global financial and economic crisis , and that its wine sector employs about 300 000 workers , this report , which I voted for , proposes the increase of the current tariff quota for wine in order to support Moldova &apos;s efforts and to provide an attractive and viable market for its wine exports , which , moreover , do not compete with Portuguese products .
this will represent the fulfilment of an important political benchmark set by the EU last April .
should we , like my friend Mr Donnelly , listen to the voice of the people ?
we should be promoting rail freight , not more centralisation .
we want an integrated Andean Community , a stronger Latin America that would be able to engage in dialogue with the European Union , and I hope that at the Rio meeting we will be able to have observers from the European Union so that , with their experience , they can guide us in this process .
at the same time as support is provided for the construction measures of the Baltic States and Poland , which seek accession , it must be ensured that Russia too can join in cooperation .
Europe must not make their rights and freedoms secondary to other considerations .
the Commission agrees with the need to authorise substances which cause a similar level of concern about risk as the most dangerous substances referred to in the Commission proposal : carcinogenic , mutagenic , persistent bioaccumulative and very persistent and very bioaccumulative substances .
let us make one thing clear : our role , our institutional role , is as important as that of the national parliaments .
on 17 June , President Santer replied , on behalf of the Commission , to the requests for clarification from Mr Blair .
consumer laws must be good laws and consumer protection and the internal market are so closely tied to each other , both legally and in respect of policy , that it would be good to coordinate these two reviews .
I think that we could , by combining transatlantic forces , persuade China to be a real stakeholder in the international system .
it proves in particular that last Thursday &apos; s decision was taken too hastily and carelessly .
this directive is to put an end to the era in which waste and damaged sites were left behind .
they embody its potential and its creative development .
this disaster in Hungary also proves the need for stricter community regulations in the area of civil protection .
and it sent the wrong signals to the public that you can be guilty and , through political manipulation , get off .
that is why we must pay careful attention to the early warning signs .
this is a particularly necessary and sensitive issue for professional qualifications .
we welcome the suspension of the use of stoning as a means of execution for women in Iran .
the Partnership , launched in Barcelona in 1995 , was created with 12 countries .
the answer again is more or less what I expected , because we have been listening to it for a long time .
moreover , the European Union is insisting on an increase in the target for reducing emissions to 30 % in 2020 , provided that other developed countries commit to comparable reductions in emissions .
it is important to come back to the increased longevity of the citizens of the European Union .
I think it is fair to make a distinction between child labour in manufacturing and child labour in agriculture .
in the USA however it is absolutely legal to trade in them .
some of the RACs have already begun to consider long-term management and the issue of MSY , and it will be important that the strategy is developed in partnership with stakeholders .
important economic adjustments have laid the basis for market economics . Reforms have strengthened the democratic system , the judiciary and respect for human rights .
on the other hand , Mrs Reding , I would like to offer you my full support with regard to funding : I am conscious that pressure must be exerted on Mr Prodi and the College of Commissioners and I know that you will strive earnestly to achieve this improvement .
this case and others , notably the wave of anti-Muslim hysteria in various European countries and the racist violence recently unleashed against the Roma community in Italy , show that xenophobia and violent racism are with us and we cannot afford the luxury of minimising them .
furthermore , the Commission should consider producing more measures in the field of energy performance and also of more renewable energy sources because , as you stated on 26 August , Mrs Wallström , if all the public authorities of the European Union were to move over to ecological energy , CO2 production would be reduced by 62 million tonnes , which would allow us to comply with the 18 % Kyoto commitments in the field of emissions reduction .
this will give us the materials we need to be able to reach decisions .
I think that this would be wrong and irresponsible of Parliament , and that is why we are asking for this item to be withdrawn .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , I would like to thank the honourable Members for their comments and suggestions , which will be taken into account in the Commission &apos;s thinking about the WTO reform .
finally I would like to say that what is happening in Georgia is perhaps also the key for Armenia .
first of all , I should like to thank the three rapporteurs for the volume of work they have carried out .
and I can inform you that the question of human rights and thus of respect for and protection of minorities have been key elements for the opening of accession negotiations since the introduction of the accession process by the Copenhagen European Council over 10 years ago .
because the new identification regulation is a Community regulation , I am quite sure that the information and advertising measures for the regulation must be exceptionally financed entirely by the Community .
that is not the long term , that is tomorrow .
Mr President , the European Commission boasts a whole raft of competences which are important in terms of a civil contribution to keeping those situations under control which threaten to get out of hand .
it was precisely that which each and every one of the Women &apos; s Committee intended , and that is why we can withdraw Amendment No 10 .
seven , to make it possible for these funds to be used in the event of an environmental emergency : for example , in reforestation following storm damage , or restoration of the natural environment following an oil slick , etc .
so what impact can the rapporteur &apos;s recommendation to the European multinationals about the moral duty to &quot; be in the vanguard of social progress &apos; have ?
on the contrary , military violence gives rise to hatred and to demands for revenge , as well as producing suicide bombers .
it is not a product which affects the environment to any great degree .
in the case of crime policy , fighting the trafficking in human beings should not be the remit of Europol alone .
a huge number of Members were very happy with your original draft calendar for the part-sessions , which brought the July part-session forward by one week .
I believe we should really focus on the need to ensure that the decisions which have already been taken are actually implemented , and that we monitor the way in which promises are being honoured .
I call on my fellow Members , the Council and Commission to support this .
many people have touched on the issue of EU agricultural policy and there is not much that I want to add to this .
that is an inadequate answer to give to European citizens , to whom we are all ultimately accountable .
these alerts and accompanying supplementary information are used for the transmission of European arrest warrants between Member States .
but back to Europe .
indeed , all of us here handle taxpayers &apos; money , and so citizens have a right to know how we are spending that money .
none of the draft budgets of the institutions include costs related to the Lisbon Treaty coming into effect .
I agree on the importance of rebuilding the infrastructure , and I agree that we have to ensure that the role of the United Nations is recognised and make sure that they are able to fulfil it well .
practitioners from other Member States must be treated in the same way as Italian citizens .
then there are Amendments Nos 6 , 7 , 9 , 10 and 11 . In one sense , I might be pleased with the amendments , because they propose that we return to some of the limit values originally proposed , or that we tighten them further , and I can only be pleased that Parliament agrees with the Commission &apos;s original proposal .
it also means that we think it necessary to have supervision .
we must remember , however , that there will only be a European social union with the involvement of European unions .
whenever we are invited to compare our growth rate with that of the USA , the lack of virtually any kind of social system in the United States must not be left out of the equation .
I will mention just two of them . We are developing measures to support the transfer of research outcomes and their transformation into tangible , marketable products and services .
for this reason , rapid action by the EU is sought .
how did the state of Israel come about ?
I hope that when a similar situation arises following the next intergovernmental conference , our procedures are changed to facilitate such a vote .
I emphasise this because it is mostly up to the Commission to come to us and say that a particular country has passed the technical criteria .
Mr President , Madam Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the fisheries agreement with Morocco is the most important fisheries agreement concluded by the Community , not only because of its economic value , which is of course considerable , but for its far-reaching social and economic implications .
we are very happy for petitions to be submitted in Welsh , but we do not agree with the amendments which state that it should be permissible for them to be submitted without a translation .
for this reason , achieving the Lisbon Strategy will also be dependent on how and when the Member States and the European Union as a whole manage to convince the citizens of the EU of the fact that without achieving the Lisbon Strategy in the long term it will not be possible to achieve the goals of growth and employment .
it is cyclical .
we have also started to consider the transparency with which the institutions operate .
the first cases were reported almost two years ago - on 25 March 2009 - and the WHO declared a phase 6 alert level on 11 June 2009 .
perhaps we should also mention that after that the Ioannina compromise was made .
I leave those pointers and I hope that the Commission will pick them up in moving forward into this new era of framework legislation for electronic commerce .
it must be addressed on a very amicable basis with our counterparts in the countries concerned because a positive development is only possible in a society when women are able to live free of fear and aggression and when threats , which are made against them and from which they suffer because they are women , are prosecuted appropriately .
as I was saying in my previous speech when my microphone was cut off by the President of the sitting , because I had exceeded my speaking time by ten seconds , when Mr Brok was able to exceed his time by as much as he liked , the ‘ European Foreign Minister ’ , who , according to the draft Convention , would implement this policy , would , moreover , combine the competences of the Commission , the High Representative and the Presidency of the Council of Ministers .
this plenary could even be held without a debate or by restricting the discussion to the two-minute speeches by the Commission and the person who drafted the report .
that is why I also believe that the EU needs to show foresight in taking action at long last to counter this dramatic development .
the Balkans , with their reputation as the &apos; powder keg of Europe &apos; , remain primarily , in spite of the progress made in recent years , a potential hotbed of interethnic tension , with political instability and the economic and social crisis added to this .
we need a genuine European forestry policy , which does not exist because it is still fragmented .
finally Mr President , the Icelandic volcano highlighted one major thing : it has strengthened the argument for a Single European Sky better than any politician could have done .
therefore , I think that there is a need for independent analysis and proper surveying at EU level , without any vested interests involved , to really establish what is good and what is bad , what is beneficial and what is not , and then we can regulate accordingly .
I especially welcome the proposal for joint hearings with the Commission and Parliament .
it is an important step that such a common minimum level should be established for the whole of the EU .
I can speak from experience here : I myself am involved in the work of a small NGO in Central America , and what the people suffered there as a result of Hurricane Mitch and Hurricane Stan is just a small foretaste of what we can expect if we do not get climate change under control .
why did the rapporteur , Mr Weber , decide to deny the European Parliament &apos;s powers by doing his utmost to get us to adopt at first reading a Council common position - moreover one that was basically unacceptable - at a time when we are having difficulty convincing citizens of the value of giving the European Parliament strengthened powers ?
the age of application varies from 58 to 67 .
true to itself , the Committee on Budgets continues to state that the decisions taken in Edinburgh on this subject must be applied to the letter and that the budget approved constitutes an objective for expenditure .
governments therefore need now to resist pressure from the federalists who want to detach Members of the European Parliament from their respective countries on the pretext of a principle of equality between MEPs that exists nowhere in the Treaties and that is entirely invented .
we might say that the enlarged EU is starting to work to an established routine .
nevertheless , we did not succeed in convincing the Commission and Council that this condition would place an excessive administrative burden on the applicant countries .
– Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , unlike Iraq , the occupation of Afghanistan rests on a solid legal basis .
all villages organise annual cultural festivals , attracting large numbers of visitors to our region .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
therefore the introduction of changes , which should be as far-reaching as possible and which would make the movement of people easier , is very important , as also is broad support for the region &apos;s young people .
I do hope that , as well as making speeches in the Chamber , honourable Members will get on to their own parliaments and governments to ensure that when we reach agreement on one of these associations agreements it can be ratified rapidly .
Europe has already had a lesson , having been unable to implement the goals set out in the Lisbon Strategy and I hope that it will learn from the mistakes that caused the economic and financial crisis .
this decision confirms the Union ’ s willingness to hold out the prospect of accession to the tormented countries in that part of our continent .
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( CS ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it is a great honour for me to be able to greet you at the opening of your five-year mandate .
Mrs Kadenbach , for example , has referred to its essential contribution to social convergence .
our Parliament has expressed itself repeatedly on the situation in Nigeria as has the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in a very significant way .
the CIRCA system proposed by the Commission is a commendable step in this direction .
occasionally it seems that , as far as the Commission is concerned , Belarus does not exist – it simply is not there .
today another regulation is being proposed to us which serves an entirely different purpose and which does not mention or budget for protecting forests against fire , and that is &apos; Forest Focus &apos; , with a budget of EUR 41 million .
( DE ) Mr President , I am much obliged to Mr Scurria .
the offers made by donors exceeded by a comfortable margin the expectations at the beginning of the conference .
many Member States had still not notified a plan by 31 March at all , and some have submitted plans that are far from ambitious .
I welcome the debate today and I look forward to the debate in the national parliaments in the months ahead .
he has managed to reflect the position of the committee faithfully .
if we consider that SMEs contribute to economic growth , social cohesion and job creation ; are a major source of innovation and play a vital role in increasing employment , we can understand the importance of the proposed amendments to this legal framework , which aim to improve the functioning of the SME finance schemes .
I therefore believe that enhanced protection of industrial property rights , including patents , is essential for European competitiveness .
I thank you for your huge interest in this debate and I hope that by the end of this year I will be able to present a legislative proposal to this House .
I am often critical of the European Commission , but on this occasion I believe it has taken a step in the right direction .
is the European Parliament to be held hostage by powerful lobby groups representing alcohol manufacturers from southern Europe or the United Kingdom ?
haul them before the Court of Human Rights ?
accordingly , another focus of the Presidency &apos; s work will be the creation of an area of greater economic and social prosperity .
it will not be surmounted unless it is understood and accepted . Let us not forget this fact .
Scottish salmon accounts for nearly 40 % of all Scottish food exports .
no discussion of this nature is ever complete without some reference to the role of the arms trade , and when we talk of major humanitarian disasters , very frequently the arms trade is mentioned and we believe , in the REX committee , that it is essential that the European Union should take steps to establish a code of conduct for the arms trade in regions of countries where obvious tensions exist and conflict is either imminent or under way .
as regards the first proposal , I share the view that we need to make a strong political gesture in support of railways .
moreover , a system of this kind should lead to greater security by providing a tool which is sound and at the same time flexible , and can be used to meet changing requirements .
I therefore believe that any escalation must be prevented .
I can understand my fellow Members &apos; concern that many unscrupulous masters will discharge waste at sea in order to avoid paying fees , but I would like to say that there is another side to the coin .
since the Bosman ruling by the European Court of Justice in December 1995 , sport has been a major topic of public debate .
the second group of proposed amendments contains proposals for fundamental changes to the existing proposal .
we have stood silent .
I do not want to say any more about that intervention .
it is Tony Blair &apos;s and the United Kingdom &apos;s position we should emulate , and I would call upon the Presidency to work towards a situation in which the EU is united in rallying to the cause of combating dictatorship .
perhaps then , one day , we will be in a position to say that the EU has guaranteed equal rights between men and women and abolished gender discrimination in the labour market .
the caring professions need a campaign to enhance their image and we have to explore why they are so unstable and why staff remain in them for so short a time .
thirdly , given that the negotiations will take such a long time and so much needs to be done , the opening of the negotiations does not , of course , guarantee a successful outcome from the outset .
that is totally unacceptable and wrong .
with the REACH regulation a European Chemicals Agency will be created to deal with such tasks as registration of substances .
Mr President , the positions I have adopted on today &apos;s votes on the crisis over Iraq have all been underpinned by an undeniable principle of solidarity .
in terms of statistics , women are not those who are most supportive of the EU .
we must also provide support for our SME &apos;s to ensure that they can comply with environmental health regulations and to take steps to improve the impact they have on the environment .
we are enclosed , shut away in a corner , and we have to work according to the letter of the law , and it is the letter which is stupid .
– Mr President , Commissioner , the EU ’ s draft budget for next year has remained in the shadow of certain major events .
we must therefore provide a stable and shared solution to this problem .
the other amendments are acceptable as they are , either in part or in principle , with the exception of three .
with the present debate , we and the Commission should send a second message : &apos; Do not think that the tragic events in Cyprus will constitute a reason to relax pressure for a solution to the Cyprus problem .
the actual challenge for every institution is to make prompt and comprehensive use of the information available and then summon the political will to take difficult decisions .
that would make me very unhappy .
road taxes will naturally be looked at with this in mind .
this monetary iron curtain separates those outside the euro area from those within it .
it is the self-identity of the European Union that will determine whether we will be able to move forward in the direction mapped by the report .
the second vital point is the link between the clause and the structures for political dialogue .
the joint strategy paper 2008-2013 defines Commission assistance to Somalia and , in concrete terms , the EC support programme for Somalia has a budget of , altogether , EUR 215.4 million from the European Development Fund ( EDF ) for the period 2008-2013 .
President Barroso is not here at the moment , but I think he needs to tell the Council that it needs to redefine the political agenda in at least three areas .
it has to be said , all things considered , that the scope of these proposals is very broad , in a territorial sense as well as time-wise .
in this case , peaceful means are not only unexhausted , they are being deliberately avoided .
the other problem we have with biofuels is that while we are getting cars produced that can take biofuels and getting drivers willing to drive the cars , there is still a great difficulty in most parts of Europe in finding petrol stations that will stock biofuels and enable the consumer to take advantage of this ecologically friendly system .
the people from my constituency , the people across the UK and the people across the European Union are saying , &apos; Let the people decide &apos; .
partnerships are necessary for current and future audiovisual creation , but hegemonic strategies and monopolies are counter to creation itself .
I should simply like to draw your attention here to the fact that subsidising the pig sector at the present time will only compound the problem , because farmers will be less willing to reduce the size of their herds .
they want a flexible institution , with a good cost-efficiency ratio .
I should also like to add that I had indicated that I wished to make an explanation of vote on the Flemming report .
there is no doubt that the Fourth Motor Insurance Directive needs updating after 15 years in force .
the basis used in auditing corporation accounts according to the 7th Company Guideline should also apply to supervision .
he claimed that the objectives of the nitrate directive and this groundwater directive are the same .
and also engine noise , which damages both the environment and the well-being of local populations and holiday-makers .
we need the Member States to act quickly and decisively .
progress is evident in the area of meeting the Copenhagen political criteria , but unfortunately , much remains to be done in the broadly-understood category of citizens &apos; freedoms .
Member States must adopt targeted political strategies to combat poverty , taking into account specific national circumstances and needs .
moreover , Commissioner , the production costs in China have risen sharply again over the past year , which suggests that these prices are practically dumping prices .
yesterday , the army intervened , killing several people including an Italian journalist .
consequently , I call on the Members of this Parliament to assume their responsibilities , so that together we can take forward this report , the difficulties and complexity of which I referred to earlier .
we know that East Timor has a largely Christian population .
we already own the Eastman Building , but between EUR 26 million and EUR 31 million have been allocated merely for renovation costs , plus EUR 3.3 million for the plans alone .
this assessment , in order to be effective , should have included a clear description of the specific objectives , a comprehensive view of all the political instruments used in this respect and then an evaluation of the results achieved .
or at the very least there is tolerance of a type of racism towards these countries .
if we lower the rate , does the percentage for voluntary set-aside accordingly become higher , yes or no ?
we especially object to paragraph 10 in which the unreasonable proposal is made that the &apos; EU should consider making it mandatory for the Member States to provide minimum levels of installation aid to young farmers &apos; .
in this regard , I wish to welcome the Commissioner &apos;s remarks here today .
( the sitting was closed at 4.25 p.m. )
it will take you a long time to find any information on this anywhere .
are Mr Le Pen and his cronies denying the Holocaust ?
this seems utterly unrealistic .
I would now like to go into more detail on the Lusaka peace process .
in that context I should like to congratulate the rapporteur .
now we Europeans have a serious problem : in the financial perspective , this Parliament wanted us to spend 1.14 % , but the President-in-Office , Mr Blair , lowered this to 1.04 % .
we have to hold on firmly to that leading role over the coming years .
in practice , if we accept these arrangements , it would mean that , through the prior consultation procedure , the French government could request to be systematically informed if Spain were to issue a long-stay visa to an Algerian national tomorrow , and it would have the right to object to the request , without anyone &apos; s knowledge , because currently no one knows which countries make use of the prior consultation procedure and the Council refuses to release the list of countries .
as in so many other areas , there applies , in this context too , a rule whereby an 80 / 20 ratio applies according to which a fifth of the cashflows may be controlled here and the remaining portion on a national basis .
we did our best in the circumstances .
I would also like to state that I have completed a survey of my own .
every year , between 70 000 and 80 000 tonnes of pesticides are poured into our environment in France .
then it is undeniably an open question as to the role to which the rotating presidency will return .
this way increases in protectionist pressures could be avoided as could sudden fluctuations in exchange rates and risks to the finance industry .
the European mandarins don &apos;t give two hoots about the election promises made to voters about Turkey &apos;s accession .
that is particularly important to small and medium-sized businesses , since late payments , especially by public authorities , pose a huge problem and result in the loss of numerous jobs every year .
according to the Commission &apos;s Green Paper , new forms of organization of work are needed in order to be able to increase the competitiveness of the Union &apos;s companies .
the tax losses due to fraud are difficult to assess .
a few minutes later , the stewardess returned .
– Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the proposal for a directive on unfair commercial practices was approved by Parliament at first reading on 20 April 2004 .
however , does it have the moral basis for doing this after it acquired Václav Klaus &apos;s signature on the Treaty of Lisbon by letting the Beneš Decrees continue to apply , thereby accepting that as a consequence , certain peoples are considered collectively guilty ?
on the other issues raised by Mr Agnoletto , I have taken note with great interest of the issue of TRIPS .
for this very reason , in the decision of 3 July 2006 that is alleged to contradict what we have done - in fact because of that decision by the Committee on Legal Affairs - we have confirmed the election of Mr Occhetto , because at the time the proclamation was in conformity with the European Act , in that we recognised his withdrawal to be invalid , improper and null and void .
we genuinely need to give a strong boost to the Member States and , I stress , to what is actually taking place at a local and regional level , so that everyone , across the board , might play a leading role in implementing this strategy in practice .
Parliament must , though , firmly reject the open coordination method .
I am , therefore , in a position to report on your proposal here and to explain it .
the EU should strengthen its aid to the developing countries according to the criteria of whether enterprises are modernising by moving towards democratisation in decision-making processes , with more transparency in the operation of public service enterprises .
the presidential elections in Ukraine complied with international election standards .
( the President cut off the speaker )
some Member States fail to respect jointly agreed regulations , and continually condone quota violations and other offences .
firstly , I do not believe that creativity is strengthened by emphasizing and protecting objects rather than their creators .
if we allow GMOs that are not permitted within the EU to be exported to third countries for the purposes of field tests - that is , for the purpose of their release into the environment - and do so without the possibility of their being monitored , then we are acting irresponsibly .
Madam President , I shall be brief , as I accept you do not want a debate .
inequalities have continued to increase there as they have in our own countries .
the Commission then found a few more reports .
I would ask that next time you chose the right rule to invoke in order to raise a point of order , because , if you do not do so , the President will not allow you to speak .
in view of the fact that you have had very forthright things to say in other situations - which I did not always find easy to defend back home , but I defended you because I have always valued your clear language - I think it important that you should find equally clear and unambiguous words in this connection .
we are particularly anxious about this matter at a time when many of our fellow citizens are deeply concerned about , and doubt , the European Union ’ s ability to control economic globalisation , given the way in which it is being managed at the moment .
in Italy , my country &apos; s national airline company has contemplated recapitalisation .
Mr Takkula , one moment : the procedure ... we are going to give you the floor soon as an additional speaker , because the representative of your group was indeed not present .
the outcome of this conference was communicated to the Council on 14 October , so it is very recent .
clearly , they need to reform .
that which has been achieved must now be defended , and I hope that the comprehensive reform of the European Union can now enter into force .
I am not , of course , going to enter into such a debate right now , even though Europe cannot remain apart from these debates , and so the Presidency , like the Commission and Parliament , must necessarily get involved .
every step , in particular , in the context of the peer reviews , can only be taken on the basis of agreement between the Commission and ENSREG , which means that without the Commission &apos;s agreement , the process cannot be completed .
to find out , you will have to wait to see if the Lisbon Treaty is fully ratified and brings about &apos; a common foreign and security policy , leading to a common defence &apos; .
Russia wants to reform the European Union by paralysing our foreign policy and by squeezing us in an energy vice between the North Stream and the South Stream .
Mr President , the Group of the Party of European Socialists is pleased that the Commission and the Senegalese Government have reached an agreement to extend the previous fisheries agreement with Senegal for eight months .
since 1960 , when the draft convention on election to Parliament by universal suffrage was adopted , our House has produced five reports which have ended up deadlocked within the Council .
it is a very complex subject which it would be impossible to analyse here , but I would like to focus on what is , in my opinion , the most interesting aspect .
we were asked for such an opinion by the Council .
I would also like to hear what Minister Malmström thinks about this situation .
this is the defining issue of the British Presidency ; it is the test of whether Europe is on the move , and we need Europe on the move .
therefore , we need to look at the defects in the system and in its application , without destroying the usefulness of this warrant .
world AIDS Day is an important day and gives us an opportunity to discuss and raise awareness ; but we should not limit ourselves to this one day , and that is why I am happy that , within the European Union at least , we will be discussing these issues continuously .
yet , despite all the fine words , the tariff regime makes the EU a difficult market-place , with 16 % being a fairly typical entry price for ACP goods .
what has happened ?
that , too , is an important message , as those saying that enlargement should be carried out on the basis of the Treaty of Nice have to understand that the notion that Europe could function effectively , and meet popular expectations in the countries wishing to join the EU , on the basis of the existing treaty structures , has been reduced to absurdity .
these issues are discussed on a regular basis as part of the political dialogue with Turkey , and , since the Council expects the principles I have mentioned of the rule of law and the civilian control of the armed forces to be fully complied with in the current situation , the presidency will continue to keep a watchful eye on the progress of the Turkish elections .
there can be no military solution to this crisis ; the only option that can be contemplated is a political solution involving all opposing parties .
I would like to point out that we need to encourage women in their individual and collective efforts , such as setting up companies , and we need to encourage women &apos;s non-governmental organisations to take an innovative approach to social activities which have a positive impact on social cohesion and job creation .
we need to strengthen Europe ’ s position on nanotechnologies in the face of global competition .
and I hear that world demand is indeed fully met now , and Turkey and India had to cut their production in 2005 and 2006 .
those of us in the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left are obviously keen to improve data protection and supervision .
it is time to stop arguing about recent differences and to concentrate on the EU &apos;s proactive engagement there .
the challenge should not be tackled with demagogy : we ask that the issue be approached with due pragmatism and bearing in mind that the worrying economic and employment situation will be a factor that makes inclusion of the Roma people in the labour market more difficult .
I understand that many people in Turkey , especially the pro-European forces , are disappointed by the Commission &apos;s proposals since they do not set a specific date for accession negotiations .
( ET ) Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , in a European Union without internal frontiers cooperation and solidarity to protect our external borders is of great importance , as is further improvement in the activity of FRONTEX .
you also announced last year that we were waiting for the new programme on internal resettlement .
in writing . - ( PT ) Pointing to a rapid rise in goods and passenger air transport , the Commission has decided to produce an &apos; action plan for airport capacity , efficiency and safety in Europe &apos; in which it puts forward a series of measures .
Mr President , I would not like to miss this opportunity to join the other Members , with knowledge of the subject , in complimenting Mr Alain Lamassoure on the quality of his report .
however , the draft text for this has also raised serious concerns in a number of respects .
for pity &apos;s sake , Mr Commissioner , honourable Ministers , give us the resources !
let me just say that , on the point of complaints , people get in touch with the Commission because they have a problem and expect some sort of response - perhaps not an immediate one , but certainly nothing that takes months and years .
I take the Supervisory Committee ’ s clear statement on this latter point especially seriously , as it directly highlights the need to create a European Public Prosecutor to protect the Union ’ s financial interests . This House has called for such an appointment for a very long time and the Commission has now added its voice to these calls in the Convention and at the Intergovernmental Conference .
that was an attempt to limit - to put it in this way - the bill to be paid by the consumer , because our first concern is to have competition and by having competition also to serve the consumer best and to have the most attractive tariff .
particularly in her briefing to aggressive lobbyists who I think have incorrectly interpreted this and who want to achieve exactly the opposite of what is intended with this directive .
( PL ) Mr Barroso , you said in your speech , today , that a priority for the Commission in its employment policy is , among other things , to help graduates and young people be effective in entering the labour market .
they have to learn to change their traditional role as sources of knowledge and make more and more use of the new technologies in their teaching and help the pupils to learn how to choose , so that they take a critical approach to the material transmitted to them .
to this end , the Commission has tabled some sensible proposals .
anything else , therefore , we have to speak out against , as Commissioner Verheugen has done , and I would like to thank him for making the important point that this Europe of ours in founded upon solidarity .
finally , what provisional measures should be taken , and when , if , as seems highly likely , the Council fails to reach a consensus before the process of ratifying the Constitution is completed ?
here are two fundamental thoughts : I believe that in the effort , which Susan &apos;s report mentions analytically , to develop special methods and surveys , we could see , and you too , Madam Commissioner , could look into how to make the best use of Cedefop in Thessaloniki to carry out such surveys .
we have used the World Cup in order to bring a taboo subject to the attention of the public , simply because football is such a big event .
Madam President .
furthermore , I wonder about Mr Mandelson &apos;s desire to fight against protectionism and about his assimilation of it , in the context of future reform - the Global Europe communication - with trade defence instruments .
upcoming EU-US summit and Transatlantic Economic Council - EU-US Data Protection Agreement ( debate )
we need to see progress on the part of the Council .
it refuses to raise the question of EU monetary policy in terms of a choice between a strong euro and a weak euro , as this is a false problem .
bearing in mind that we in this House support the peace process , and that together with our international partners we have committed four and half billion dollars to underpin it , and also remembering the importance of bi-partisanship in the Irish peace process , I would ask you , Mr President , to urge the two main parties in Sri Lanka , together with the Tamil Tigers , to support the re-opening of negotiations to ensure that permanent peace is brought to that troubled country .
this applies to the question of the threshold for incoming funds , which will remain traceable , while the threshold will prevent legal over-reaction against the participating banks on the issue of possible international threshold values .
in conclusion , I would like to say that as a doctor I am pleased that Directive 2004 / 40 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down requirements concerning the establishment of action values and exposure limit values for individual electromagnetic fields , as well as requirements for the protection of the health and safety of workers exposed to electromagnetic fields in the course of their work .
Mr President , I agree with the initial analysis made by the President of the Commission , Mr Prodi , when he referred to the fact that recent years have been marked by a impressive collection of dogmas that have been destroyed , of impossibilities that have become a constant reality and of constant realities , such as the Berlin Wall , that have fallen like the Cedars of Lebanon , as recounted in the classics .
it should of course be borne in mind that decisions taken in areas with geographical indications must be taken with due regard for - and under the supervision of - those who have invested their capital and labour in these projects .
the first concerns the incident at Dover , which shocked us all .
some have said we have to accept the results of democratic elections .
where should these troops withdraw to ?
I will present this paper to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in more detail on 9 May .
adversity sometimes produces an opportunity to be constructive , positive and to build better for the future .
fourthly , we want a further look at the flexibility clauses so that certain Member States are able in practice to deepen their relationship without threatening the acquis .
the cost-effectiveness of establishing a fuel industry based on renewable resources is dependent in the early stages on the attitude of this Parliament and national governments .
inevitably , all these situations are having repercussions for us here in Europe .
who is it supposed to exert this influence on ?
this is a misapprehension that crops up occasionally : whereas a fine imposed by the Commission for a cartel or abuse of a dominant position is credited to the Community budget , an order for reimbursement of illegal and incompatible state aid requires a transfer of money from the firm that wrongfully received it to the Member State in question and not to the Community budget .
( BG ) Ladies and gentlemen , the Attack Group is voting against the Turkey progress report because we do not see any progress .
it aims to provide opportunities for those who are taking part in work-linked training and their employers to benefit from the trainees or apprentices receiving part of their training in another Member State and for that training to be accredited .
let me just read you the figures for the afternoon . That afternoon , the time available for speaking to the reports amounts to 50 minutes each for the Council and the Commission , while Mr Brok , the rapporteur , gets five – which is quite utterly inadequate in view of the importance of his report – and all the Members put together get 90 minutes between them .
that was not the final solution , and we think that using CO2 , maybe a little bit later , would be a much more effective compromise .
Sinn Féin believes that the enlarged EU must adopt a new set of priorities .
start representing your people and not just your car manufacturers !
the Angelakas report offers a welcome simplification of the eligibility conditions for investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy for housing .
it is creaking under the strain of the mass movement of 21 million migrants a year .
– Chancellor , the recipe for success is very simple : take a large photograph of Blair , hang it opposite your desk and write underneath it &apos; I must not copy &apos; . You are sure to succeed .
in this regard , I would like to warn the representative of the Council , the Portuguese Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs , that the Intergovernmental Conference should already be starting to prepare for this eventuality .
but two chapters , telecommunications and the CFSP , remain on the table and will still have to be discussed in due course by the conference .
to my fellow Members Mrs Lynne , Mrs Sinnott and Mr Burke I will say , by way of example , that the EGF can achieve a lot , but it certainly cannot solve all regional problems .
the Palestinian Authority is still facing financial and institutional collapse .
would that meet with the agreement of the House ?
lastly , I decided also to support the report when it states that it is crucial to include explicit provisions on public access to documents .
as I mentioned , I am planning my own visit and will discuss this issue when I meet representatives of the Greek Government in October .
furthermore , I should like to add that the price element is only one aspect of the exhaustion issue .
any discussion of the most disadvantaged people living in the worst circumstances must make special mention of Roma women , a significant proportion of whom live in villages and small settlements .
it is crucial that the Convention responsible for framing the text completes its work in sufficiently good time in order to be able to deliver the charter by the end of this year .
now , that is the question the British and Dutch governments should be thinking about .
what we need , then , is a new chapter in European space policy , and I very much welcome the positive approaches contained in the Green Paper on the subject .
written statements ( Rule 149 )
the will of Moldovan citizens has been undermined by the authorities through the numerous irregularities which can provide arguments to support the assumption that the elections have been rigged .
there were , let us be honest , certain attempts to reduce and to weaken the competence of the Commission .
first of all , let me emphasise that the aim set forth in the Commission communication &quot; Reinvigoration of the Barcelona Process &quot; was twofold : to draw up a balance sheet of the Barcelona Process and to formulate recommendations in preparation for the ministerial conference in Marseilles in November 2000 .
Mr Bourlanges has already produced a report on the Council , adopted by the House not very long ago , which includes a series of suggestions designed to improve its functioning .
can I assure her that our attitude is not guided by any motivation to farm out . We are concentrating on core tasks and we are concentrating on priorities , not in order to evade any obligations but to absolutely guarantee that we can totally fulfil the central obligations that we have .
legislating on environmental liability is like opening a Pandora ’ s box , so badly is environmental damage defined and so imprecise is the scope of the legislation , particularly on the issue of biodiversity , which is already governed by two major international conventions , those of Berne and of Bonn .
first of all , I would like to congratulate Mr Corbett on his superb report and on the clear explanations he provided , both at the beginning and at the end .
they are : a high standard of living for all our citizens , a high level of social security for all our citizens , a high environmental standard for Europe as a whole and awareness of our global responsibility .
a smokescreen of market confidence has been cast to cover up certain real problems .
this figure is simply too low and substantial investment will be needed if wholesale expansion in this sector is to occur .
it is most important that we do not , whether consciously or not , have any confusion in our minds - either in the minds of the public or , as I have seen in this House , in our own - about the use of depleted uranium weapons and the use of nuclear weapons .
it is in this spirit that we are working within the convention , both in terms of the timetable and the form .
in the meantime , the whole problem has taken on even greater urgency .
in other words , what had previously been a three- or six-monthly event is now the habitual manner of governing the Union in order to provide an immediate response to immediate challenges .
what we want is not just economic upturn but its conversion into a sustainable process of growth which creates new jobs .
we must not lose sight of the fact – which the groups ’ resolution makes clear – that it is for us in this European Parliament to state that the conditions are formally met – in contrast to their form of words , which refers to ‘ sufficiently fulfilled ’ – and that issues of minority rights , issues relating to the processes of reform within Turkey , and the freedom of religion issue have a major part to play in this .
nevertheless , since 1996 the European Parliament has also been calling for legal specifications for agricultural and forestry tractors .
I fear that this incentive for a modal shift , of which we are , of course , in favour , is counterproductive , brings about distortion of competition and undermines the work that has been done in the framework of the rail infrastructure package .
in my view , we have come full circle . We not only need a coherent policy within development policy , but it has to be important for EU policy as a whole to engage in a tangible way in the fight against poverty and underdevelopment .
you quite rightly referred to the mechanisms which are being established in connection to the Lamfalussy procedure , which we doubt the Council and the Commission would wish to extend to other areas , hence the importance of obtaining a genuine call-back procedure for Parliament .
these events and struggles led to the democratic transitions in central Europe in 1989-90 .
does the Council have a particular strategy on how to compel Russia to join the WTO ?
furthermore , Hungary has attracted one of the highest rates of direct foreign investment of any applicant country and its gross national product accounts for nearly 13 % of the total GNP of all twelve applicant countries .
Mr President , a report such as this one , on the proposal for a Council Regulation creating a mechanism whereby the Commission can intervene in order to remove certain obstacles to trade , deserves another debate , not the one on the agenda at this time .
our proposals are much more ambitious than the current directive .
however , today , the third generation of nuclear power stations is completely different from what was built in Chernobyl .
I would also like to express my thanks for the contribution made by Mrs Sbarbati , draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets , as well as for the interventions of the other speakers who have participated in this debate .
in any case , it is a shared concern , and therefore we must ensure that we provide high-quality training and that there is guidance available .
a study by the Commission is now available on the competitive position for various types of shipbuilding and in particular gas tankers .
if we do not take a decision today , this Parliament will be acting as a eunuch because the Council can move forward and take the decision without the opinion of Parliament .
I wonder , Minister , if that means that you will be publicly putting pressure on Britain , Sweden and Finland , among others , to cease selling arms to places like Indonesia where they have been used in genocide campaigns against the East Timorese .
risk communication will also be a key element .
the Member States are capable themselves of dealing with matters relating to population and housing censuses and this is an area in which the EU does not need to interfere .
so what have we done in 1997 to tackle the points made by the Court ?
the real reason was that he refused to do something which is a matter of course , which is the duty of every Austrian citizen , namely to render account of his activity if he is being paid for it by the Austrian Government .
but I can assure you that there is a heightened and increasingly strong awareness that we must share that responsibility and give effect to that solidarity .
we need to simplify , open up , clarify and review all of the European Union &apos; s tasks and bring about an order in which the EU concentrates on fewer things , that is to say the genuinely cross-border problems .
– Mr President , I too would like to refer first to aspects of research and development that can be the driving forces generating value for businesses .
more than forty years have passed since I learned from Patrick McGuilligham at the Faculty of Law in Dublin what the expression &quot; rubber stamp parliament &quot; means .
he has done a good job over a relatively short period of time .
consequently , the threatened total abolition of import quotas next 1 January may seriously hamper development and exacerbate unemployment , especially in areas with the highest concentration of textiles and clothing companies , such as the North and Beiras regions of Portugal .
Mr President , there is a long-established principle in the European Union , established , in fact , by Jean Monnet himself , of the beneficial crisis : whenever something is going badly wrong , whenever national governments are concerned as to what to do , when the public are deeply fearful , then the answer , of course , is more integration and more central control within the European Union .
and that is therefore not a choice that the Luxembourg summit should make .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Madrid European Council granted a mandate for defining ways in which the European Parliament could be closely associated with the work of the conference .
this , however , is not the case , as the broad lines of these proposals are public , having been posted on our web site at the end of the year 2000 , and there have been no changes to the political principles since then .
Mr President , we addressed this question last week in a perfectly normal manner .
the report on innovative financing addresses a number of important aspects .
the Commission has already responded within the framework of a written question . The Member States are not bound to transmit information relating to the management of complaints from air passengers or to the penalties imposed on airline operators .
France loses between EUR 1 billion and EUR 4 billion .
2 . Europol staff : adjustment of basic salaries and allowances (
these crimes are suppressed as much as possible .
we therefore voted against this report .
attractive objectives are set .
the Danish Social Democrats have a positive attitude to promoting equality between men and women .
in this time of economic tumult it is imperative that all nations in Europe are on a level playing field and should not have to be concerned about jobs moving to non-EU countries involved in supplying state aid to ailing firms .
where good alternatives to animal testing are available , these must be used , as we want less animal testing .
he contrasts the position in the United States and the European Union in terms of jobs , spin-offs and the development of a scientific culture .
if the resolution were really aimed at an effective criminal prosecution of fraud and criminal activity detrimental to the interests of the Community , it would have received our support .
they still earn 15 % less than men for comparable work , and they have fewer opportunities for promotion .
however , despite some positive proposals , these are regrettably overwhelmed by those which the European Parliament regards as negative .
in writing . - ( HU ) The extremist movements that are growing stronger throughout Europe give us cause for grave concern , since their political activities are based on inciting hatred against the most vulnerable groups in society , and they preach intolerance and social exclusion .
there is , however , one positive aspect that I would like to mention , and that is the Interinstitutional Agreement , which it is intended should be now concluded , following lengthy preparatory work by Commission President Prodi and in Parliament .
a lot of good things are written about life-long learning , about further education and about education in general .
if these targets are not met in 2020 , the Commission can take Member States to court for non-compliance with the requirements of the Directive .
I would like to stress the following fact .
it has been , and will continue to be , guided in its actions solely by the necessity to protect the health of its citizens .
B5-0156 / 99 by Mr Barón Crespo and others , on behalf of the PSE Group , on the aviation accident at Ustica ;
as rapporteur for the air quality directive I can tell you I wish that all technical systems were as clean and energy-efficient as our modern passenger cars .
in vitro diagnosis
I am much obliged to him for this .
the Bureau called on the Zimbabwean Government to put a stop to the violence in the country and to respect human rights and the rule of law .
I hope that the Commission will reflect on its future approach to cooperation with Members of Parliament - including outside the European Union - but above all , with regard to the subject matter , I hope that it will work much harder to preserve the conditions necessary for the survival not just of the European Union and its almost 400 million inhabitants - which soon will exceed 400 million - but of the whole planet .
the problems of agriculture will not be solved in this way .
B5 ­ 0725 / 2000 by Mrs Schroedter and others , on behalf of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , on the danger of nuclear submarines ;
in the former case , despite the corruption and the more inferior services now provided , the job gets done and some form of utility is provided , while in the latter nothing ever gets done and the economy suffers .
( IT ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this report makes it a good day for Parliament for a number of reasons .
it is for that reason that I attach particular importance to the major summit meeting to be held in Barcelona at the end of November , at which Heads of State and Government will , for the first time , be able to have their say on this subject .
the car service is often abused and we have to make sure that it is very carefully controlled indeed .
it is perhaps his right to say he has no answer , but he cannot be allowed to ignore justifiable parliamentary questions , that is not done !
you need only look at the map and see the distances they travel .
you will agree with me that these amounts , which are already lower than in 2001 , are very modest and are really the minimum required to ensure that Europe can play a prominent role on the world stage , especially in those regions which are being plagued by the crises with which we are all familiar .
in connection with Amendment No 10 , there have been discussions between the Commissioner and his employees and , especially , between myself and my own employees .
it is also a consistent position , because it asks for human rights and fundamental freedoms to be respected , in order for Cuba to be rooted in our system of values and not in foreign systems such as those of China or Vietnam .
we do not have the figures as yet and without figures , it is very difficult to establish the budget .
this has meant a lot of rhetoric about a citizen &apos;s Europe but not much change in the mentality or administrations of the Member States , as Mrs Wallis has pointed out .
since I am basically critical of EUROPOL , and Schengen in general , and I believe that having one General Secretary instead of three does not equal better data protection , I intend to abstain .
that is why I warn against the hysterical cries of a European Union crisis coming as a result of the problems of the reform of the treaty .
the EU , together with the United States , international organisations , foundations and the opposition in these and other countries should therefore take a combined initiative and devise an international peace and democracy plan for the whole of the Middle East .
we also know , however , that other Member States that do not face such problems consider their humanitarian obligation fulfilled if they accuse other states .
Turkey is the key element in this area as demonstrated in different ways by its growing dispute with Greece over Cyprus and the Aegean , the agreement with Israel , the military presence in Kurdistan and the attitude it had adopted to the Iraq crisis .
if your group gives you two minutes ’ speaking time , then you stick to those two minutes .
I hope that they will make use of it for the good of Europe .
of course we have to complete the rest of Agenda 2000 as well but we have to be there for the March Summit .
the budgetary procedure for 2010 has been demanding and I am pleased with the agreement that was reached between our institutions during the conciliation meeting in mid-November .
I wish to thank the rapporteurs , Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck , for these conclusive reports , which also lay very definite emphasis on this .
the programme is , of course , also a result of intensive contact and in-depth negotiations with the EU Member States and also with the European Parliament .
( SV ) Madam President , in the European Parliament we have often spoken about respect for democracy and human rights and freedoms , but the truth is , and this is something I am sure we can acknowledge this evening , that we have often given priority to something else , namely political stability and good business relations .
it was also an occasion to seek greater commitment from the parties implementing the Dayton agreements .
it is indeed important when introducing this kind of measure that all airlines , both EU and non-EU carriers , are subject to the same requirements .
both measures discussed today will significantly contribute to paving the way for the revision of the EU financial and supervisory framework .
in this connection , I have taken a careful note of the invitation which your Member and my friend , Mr Jan-Kees Wiebenga , addressed to me .
I therefore note that with regard to this ruling of the Court of Justice you are using different methods of implementation depending on the point in question .
– Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , some years ago the British Commissioner responsible for international trade was asked : ‘ What should be the minimum market share that the textile sector in Europe should be guaranteed ? ’ The reply was : ‘ None , if the market is pushing in that direction . ’
in any event we should praise the efforts of all those who are striving to ensure high-quality teaching and assistance in the integration of and familiarisation with multicultural Europe .
in addition , they suggest some interesting lines of approach for the future .
Mr President , honourable Members , in this first plenary part-session of the year I should like to wish all of you an excellent 2006 .
the result would be an increase in emissions and at the same time tens of thousands , if not hundreds of thousands , of jobs would be lost .
the offer of an exchange premium for reducing cultivation of apples and pears by 10 , 000 hectares , with a further 10 , 000 hectares for peaches and nectarines seems balanced .
nobody wants an all encompassing IGC dealing with every subject facing the Union in the Maastricht style , but there is a strong case to add to the agenda half a dozen key subjects which must be resolved if our Union is to work efficiently , transparently and democratically and is to be capable of facing up to having nearly 30 Member States .
I invite my colleagues to condemn the use of force in Fiji , not to recognise the usurpers of power , and to support the opposition &apos;s invitation to the people of the country to oppose the revolution through peaceful demonstrations .
indeed , since then , the Council has made little real progress following the highly verbose phraseology of space and freedom , security and justice .
both a pensioner spending three months with his children and a student making use of the Erasmus programme will therefore have access not just to the necessary health care but also to the care that would be offered , in the same situation , to persons residing in the given Member State .
secondly , you ask me what provision has been made for sanctions by the Commission .
the last EU-India summit held two weeks ago endorsed an ambitious joint action plan which provides the framework for a qualitative transformation in the way we engage with India .
one illustrative element is the measures announced recently for cars .
similarly , I would like to ask how training is evaluated and its cash value determined ; what is the definition of voluntary work , and what sort of cash value could be worked out for it ?
and the staff have to be on fixed contracts , whereas temporary staff have to be for precisely that - for work which is only temporary .
at the IGC Conference , this central issue of democratic control is not even being touched upon , except in the case of the Belgian Government , which just last week put forward a proposal to review this issue .
( DE ) Mr President , neither party to the conflict has so far met the demands of the United Nations for a credible and independent investigation into the accusations of the Goldstone report .
we have seen 311 million Europeans enjoy the advantages of having a common currency , and we have also seen all of the Member States of the European Union enjoy the advantages of the fact that twelve of them have adopted the single currency .
as is indicated in the directive , the concept of fair compensation offers Member States a considerable degree of flexibility or freedom of judgment when they decide on the form , the modalities or the level of fair compensation regulations .
they say this so often as if it is a fact .
in my opinion , the Czech Republic and other countries should and can continue bilateral negotiations with the United States .
as you know the Commission and I personally are committed to fully implementing the European action plan against trafficking in human beings which I proposed here at the beginning of 2006 and which this Parliament endorsed .
maintaining access for this humanitarian aid is crucial , and we will continue our work , even if the circumstances are difficult and appear to be worsening at present .
in its present form , the agreement constitutes a restriction on Parliament &apos; s right to information , as guaranteed under the Treaty .
in fact , their role will change from being passive beneficiaries of a service to becoming active players in the market .
Mr Pirker , I feel the best course of action , in fact , is to move on quickly to the report .
the Prodi Commission – as my colleague has already explained once again on the Commission &apos;s behalf today – took action as soon as the scale of the problems became known .
that means dismantling export refunds .
we cannot let emissions be auctioned off ; we have only bad experience of the UMTS and other auctions .
it must surely be clear to everyone by now that our climate is changing .
to my mind , the Feio report is the most professional report we have had in the last three months .
there are still six years to go .
written statements ( Rule 142 )
firstly , not all of them have entered into force ; they are even taking a long time to do so .
we have already had a whole series of debates on this .
furthermore , it may also help if mutual trust has already been established between the various groups .
the third contribution that I want to mention here is our experience with the crisis in the banking sector which we went through at the end of the 1990s .
it is a problem that affects a growing number of people , particularly the young and , to an increasing extent , ethnic minorities .
in addition to its direct input into the economy , the creative and cultural sector has an indirect impact on the European socio-economic environment .
the fight against drugs must be conducted at all levels , i.e. at local , national , European and international level .
it was at my suggestion five years ago that we adopted this position , which the Council approved in a meeting on 25 March , following the tragic attacks in Madrid .
there are still one or two questions to be answered , and I am not sure whether Mrs Gradin can answer them today .
I doubt it .
I support what Mr Menéndez del Valle said about needing more resources .
Mr Cot replied that this was an exception , and that there had been translation problems .
obviously I am bound to refute his assertions .
Mrs Jeggle , you proposed that we should at least utilise the appropriations in 1b - i.e. those for rural development - and you linked this to the disastrous storms in Badem-Württemberg in which many trees were uprooted by the strong winds .
what does taking responsible political action actually mean ?
the countries which have not ratified the Kyoto Protocol are trying to gain an unfair competitive edge .
today at the Hannover Messe , I saw that smart metering is making good progress and companies are taking these decisions on board .
just one example of this is Eurostat .
I think it is a good thing that , amidst the commotion that has preceded this debate and to some extent surrounds it now .
I hope that FIFA recognises that and will now finally come up with something that the Commission can include in its proposals , as long as they do not run counter to the Bosman judgment .
thus , Mrs Bonino , a resigning Commissioner , visited the headquarters of NATO , an international organisation , to meet its Secretary-General for the first time .
that makes Darfur not only a disgrace to the Sudanese regime , but also to the international and European institutions .
on the substantive issue , while being aware that not all Member States are involved in the Schengen Agreement , of course , it seemed to our committee that we should bring the rights of third-country nationals into line with those of citizens .
at the beginning of February of this year , the Czech Republic joined the calls for enhanced cooperation , and I therefore hope that accession of my country to the unitary patent protection system will help to support scientific resources and better scientific results , both in the Czech Republic and elsewhere .
it is important if we wish to improve air quality .
this has been one of my group ’ s main areas of focus .
this resolve provides political momentum for the French G20 Presidency that will take up a comprehensive reform of the international monetary system .
it is , first and foremost , private investors who find this attractive , as it helps to further develop each country &apos; s specialist knowledge of production niches for exporting goods in terms of the requirements of the global market and not of populations .
the role of local and regional authorities must expand by adopting a local development methodology based on regional partnerships , especially for projects relating to urban , rural and cross-border aspects .
the situation in Europe has without a doubt become more difficult again for competition policy .
in order to achieve these objectives , the proper coordination of National and Local Action Plans is crucial , and these must clearly indicate the role and the level of participation of local authorities , so that the training and the information provided for all actors involved contributes to the improved organisation of the measures to be adopted .
the members of this committee were unanimous in extending protection for maternity and paternity leave , for adoption and during pregnancy and , once again , we recommend , as Parliament has done , that Directive 92 / 85 / EC be revised .
people who rely on help from the European Union do so irrespective of the institution , and that is why cooperation between the institutions is so very important .
in this connection , we warmly welcome the fact that the new rules will be applied according to the principle of subsidiarity by transposing them into national programmes approved by the Commission .
they introduce selective immigration governed by market requirements .
even now , when hundreds of thousands of jobs are at stake , the Commission is spouting the dogma of competition , hindering national measures designed to prevent job losses , and demanding explanations from Renault in order to satisfy itself that the increase in production in a factory is not the result of a relocation of operations .
with respect , that is sleight of hand and is targeted at people &apos;s ignorance ; it ignores the fact , for example , that if we did not have EU law , we would still have national law , even in the United Kingdom , and indeed in particularly large quantities , as we know .
the Commission &apos;s proposal is flawed in that it fails to propose a time-scale for revising the application of the directive .
even though our goal is to simplify commercial transactions between Member States while at the same time safeguarding security and protection of European citizens , such a goal would not be feasible without the presence of customs representatives , namely specialised professionals with certified knowledge .
– Mr President , I should just like to protest against the fact that this motion for a resolution is only available in English , since all the other language versions had to be pulped on account of errors .
Mr President , last Monday &apos;s joint declaration by France , Germany and Russia begins with a sentence which I believe everyone will approve of .
admittedly , the Council &apos;s idea of nominating cities in turn for each Member State has been preserved , but the direct choice of city to nominate by the Member State has been abandoned ; several cities in the same country may submit an application .
the costs have been four times , and even ten times less than the estimates made beforehand .
the answer most frequently given to this serious accusation is that the best way in which the European States can defend themselves is to improve their competitiveness .
the debate on European citizenship , as Commissioner Frattini quite rightly says , is directly linked to the harmonious integration of immigrants and the major question of political citizenship .
the eco-audit is one such approach , and that eco-audit has done a great deal to bring about a situation where thousands of enterprises have now declared their willingness to play an active part here .
this study also highlighted some differences in the methods of financing .
Mr President , I do not know whether to comment on the hysterical remarks by some Members of the House , or simply to ignore them .
relations between Mercosur and the EU are going through a very important period , since the negotiations for a free trade area have reached their sixth round and are proceeding at a fast pace .
this is inadequate , and I am personally delighted that Mr Barnier has stated an idea close to my heart and which , moreover , I expressed when I told the press in Bordeaux what I am hoping for , and that is the establishment of a reinforced policy of European civil security .
this is not America , where migrants who all live in one and the same community yet speak different languages by origin , need to adopt the official language in order to be able to communicate with one other .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Ribeiro e Castro &apos; s very useful report mentions , in particular , the importance of transparency and the importance of reliable statistics on jobs .
this is just the first step : we should continue to press for more .
when we talk about 2007 , we also talk about enlargement , because Romania and Bulgaria will most likely become Member States of the European Union by then .
I therefore voted against the report and contributed to its rejection by Parliament .
let me offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur for his endeavour in pursuit of this goal .
also , aside from risk jobs , we have very vulnerable sections of the workforce - elderly , disabled and workers who do not speak the language of their present workplace .
– When you buy a new car in , for example , Portugal , you have to pay an astronomical registration tax to the government , sometimes nearly half the final cost of the car .
those who have done so have all been ousted , while those who have come to power have promised easy solutions .
in the matter of controlling mergers , the Commission &apos; s priority for 2001 will be to continue to re-examine the mergers regulation .
we need to pre-empt rather than react : when a crisis is with us , it is too late .
after enlargement the Baltic Sea will virtually be an internal sea of the EU , except , however , in one corner where it meets Russia and what is almost that country &apos;s most populous region , St. Petersburg and the area around it .
in numerous documents , and recently the report on a citizens &apos; network , Parliament has emphasized the social importance of public transport .
but since the case-law of the Court of Justice considers that this article is not applied to compulsory social security schemes , where they are directly regulated by law , the same is not true of occupational social security schemes .
I believe that consumers also have the right to know whether or not they have been produced using genetic engineering .
I hope we can draw a more favourable conclusion in next year &apos;s report than we were able to do today .
these measures have made the democratic process devoid of content and forced a quarter of the country &apos;s population to emigrate .
in the short-term , there needs to be severe restriction of the number of goods vehicles passing through the region , including the Mont Blanc Tunnel when it reopens at the end of this year .
and they , or their fellow travellers , are the ones who come and give us lessons in &apos; human rights &apos; !
we began to discuss the future of Europe in Cardiff ; this process should be intensified in Pörtschach and be continued at the Vienna European Council and during the forthcoming presidencies .
we saw how the Nigerians operate at the last ACP meeting when fifteen diplomats flew in in a special plane to intimidate the other African countries to such an extent that they did not dare vote in favour of a resolution criticizing Nigeria .
I call on the Commission to begin taking , as soon as requested by the respective Member State , all the necessary steps to mobilise as much of the European Union Solidarity Fund as is possible .
we have to take into account that some Member States keep blocking the adoption of this necessary document .
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned .
this subject is usually good for the emotions and it is used from time to time to upset food consumers .
that is why reproductive material , which guarantees that forests will withstand the harsh climate , is absolutely essential and indispensable to the safety of the Alps .
this means that the Commission will always present the reports and suggestions on time .
- Before the vote on Amendment 37
( DE ) President-in-Office , I think that the Czech Presidency is taking a very positive and proactive approach to this issue .
we are prepared for that .
in all of these cases the position lays down clear objectives .
the report seems to respond positively to these questions . It also puts forward certain proposals that would undoubtedly improve the current situation .
how is democratic scrutiny at Community level to be ensured ?
Mr President , I should like , above all , to thank the Liberal Group for proposing this resolution .
the coup d &apos;etat is seriously undermining the Fijian economy , primarily in the tourist sector .
no one really wanted to give the Constitution active consideration .
for example , steps must be taken to ensure that exchanges between the databases of Member States actually work in practice .
although no one can argue against the need for such a guaranteed minimum income scheme , it may obviously be open to abuse .
those measures will be effective only if their principles and their provisions are applied by both the Member States and non-EU countries .
specific actions should be proposed regarding alcohol and speed , such as alcohol locks in certain vehicles or more stringent requirements for novice drivers .
I am one of those hoping for serious debates to take place , including in this House , so that we can take decisions based on careful consideration .
we urgently need to focus our efforts by expanding our programmes to cover the central and eastern European countries and equipping them with the appropriate material resources .
please God .
however , Mr Gahler , you should at least be made aware that I made very clear , in a press release , no less , which was also on behalf of my group , that the secret services must be monitored .
however , as the Commissioner said earlier , the roots of this situation are political and the solution to it must be political .
European Investment Bank , European Commission , we are actually asking for an investigation into the activities of the European Investment Bank towards the end of September this year so that we can start the next discharge procedure with proper documentation .
sadly , however , the Union &apos; s policy is ambivalent .
let us allow time for ideas to germinate .
I support the idea that cooperation between participants in programmes financed by PEACE and IFI ( International Fund for Ireland ) should not cease when the programmes come to an end .
Europe &apos;s responsibility , Minister , is therefore becoming overwhelming .
these financial regulations were introduced because Parliament asked for them in the past .
the outgoing Commission stood on collegiate responsibility .
the Commission has been leading and coordinating the development of a coherent European response .
next year there will be elections in several countries of the European Union and we need an institution which not only cares for the coming generations , but which takes account of their concerns and challenges .
I believe that the report we now have before us achieves a good balance between the views of those who believe that we should regard Russia first and foremost as a strategic partner , and of those who believe that democracy and human rights must be the focus of our relations with the country .
that is , it ends up calling for the same type of monetarist and neoliberal policies and criteria , tightening the veritable stranglehold imposed on the Member States , without a care for the causes of the problems , or for alternative policies that take into account economies &apos; different levels of development .
if we do not do anything now , a million people are condemned to die in a few months , but if we continue to do what the international community has done up until now , these famines will reoccur cyclically .
the rate of this loss from the planet has accelerated to a point where it is occurring at least 100 times faster than natural cycles , and during the last 50 years , it has reached unprecedented levels .
the recommendation for second reading , by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , on the Council common position for adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the Registration , Evaluation , Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals ( REACH ) , establishing a European Chemicals Agency , amending Directive 1999 / 45 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Regulation ( EEC ) No 793 / 93 and Commission Regulation ( EC ) No 1488 / 94 as well as Council Directive 76 / 769 / EEC and Commission Directives 91 / 155 / EEC , 93 / 67 / EEC , 93 / 105 / EC and 2000 / 21 / EC &#91; 07524 / 8 / 2006 C6-0267 / 2006 ( Rapporteur : Guido Sacconi ) , and
I have abstained from voting on Resolution regarding Haiti because I believe it is urgent for civilian professionals such as doctors , architects and fire-fighters to be sent to the region instead of troops .
in addition to high food prices , the EU faces rising oil prices .
what we , and many sides , are describing means , however , that one already has .
this , therefore , raises several questions .
for Poland , and also for Warsaw , a key factor will be the level of funding and the priorities set out under the cohesion fund .
nobody has so far been able convincingly to disprove information that such experiments have also been carried out with human beings .
from the Council &apos; s perspective , the UK Government expressed a similar view . It seems unlikely that a French Presidency , which is highlighting consumer affairs , will take a different view .
it allows us , of course , to have spin-offs in a variety of sectors which have already been mentioned and which will enhance the SME sector .
it is a member of the European Free Alliance ( ALE ) , which has been a European political party since it began .
I am going to turn my attention away from the text again for just a moment .
we will need all our available strength at political level simply to hold Member States to respecting their 2005 commitments .
the Commission considers that only if there is detailed dialogue with all social players , at European as well as national and local level , will it be possible to identify the solutions we need .
the regulation only covers the procedure in the case of Article 291 .
as far as possible this should be fresh local food , and this will mean we will support home food producers by raising demand .
demographic , economic and social factors in Europe demand solutions that will turn the professional and cultural experience of older people to good account , ensuring that their living conditions are of as high a quality as possible and minimising the expenditure arising from this demographic trend .
the Danish Social Democrats agree to the report &apos;s many good job-creation proposals .
the Europe which has no army of its own and has a European army with an American commander-in-chief like ΝΑΤΟ ?
like so many of these detainees , Mehdi Ghezali is young .
we will look at what improvements can be made to Frontex and to its operations as the need arises .
Robert McCartney will never see his children grow .
so I want people to know in advance : whatever that platform is , I want to use it in a way that opens up space to have creative political debate on the floor of this House .
the problem is that protectionism still persists in many Member States .
how many of the 40 organisations will be sent as representatives of employers ?
Mr President , credit is certainly due to the Danish Presidency for producing a more judicious immigration policy , particularly as regards questions such as the very sensitive issue of asylum , for policies on these matters have , for a long time , in practice , actually tended to encourage illegal immigration .
question Time ( Commission )
it is said that some of these people receive funds from Iran and other fundamentalists centres in the Middle East and that there are people in Europe who are supporting them .
the Presidency will shortly be taking measures to that end .
thanks must also go to colleagues from other groups who have made very constructive suggestions .
Mrs Oomen-Ruijten is to be congratulated on the fact that in three months she has produced a wide range of consensus in Parliament , which I hope the Commission will note , on the substance of these proposals .
– Mr President , Mr Frattini , ladies and gentlemen , I do not wish to add anything to the reports by Mr Di Pietro and Mr Costa , with which I am in absolute agreement .
people have to wait until the following harvest in September or October , always assuming , of course , that there is a proper rainy season .
we also express our concern for Mr Hu Jia &apos;s health .
on the strength of that report ’ s findings , the Commission immediately contacted the countries concerned in order to investigate the present situation precisely and called on the authorities of the countries concerned to inform the Commission of the existing circumstances .
they should cover all categories of legislative proposal and employ a clear methodology .
concerning the increase in GDP , statistically of course it is not possible to have a direct link , but you can do correlation analyses from which you can find out that this is correlated in the long term .
this is a unique institution , bringing together representatives of the European Parliament , the Commission , the Council of Ministers and other organizations relevant to the further development of a pan-European transport policy - for example , the Council of Transport Ministers , the United Nations Economic Commission , the Economic and Social Committee and the Civil Aviation Authority .
we need an EU policy and an EU mechanism to combat corruption and fraud in a robust way within the EU , and the Stockholm Programme must reflect that need and commitment .
President-in-Office , your Prime Minister must hold firm to Europe &apos;s red lines and he must deliver next week a treaty able to underpin a strong , responsive and effective Union .
but , these specifically are the issues involved in the work which will be carried out within the convention and , on behalf of my Group , I wish to state the importance we shall accord the charter &apos; s content in terms of such questions .
in Portugal , in my region of Oporto district , this tragedy was felt very deeply . It has left families without their father , husband or son , the man who guaranteed a livelihood for the family at a time of high unemployment in Northern Portugal .
this just shows the importance we must place on examining the accounts of this House .
is there an agreement with the United Nations for &apos; the day after &apos; ?
this latter directive is , moreover , the subject of a change that seeks to make the installation of safety belts obligatory in all vehicles .
should there be a decision to impose measures , they usually take the form of a duty calculated on the CIF import price .
finally , I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on her report and I support her amendments , in particular those regarding the free professions in the Council Decision .
there is now an opportunity to end yet another division in Europe .
.
what can be done in order that countries of origin , especially those considered ‘ safe countries ’ would cooperate ?
this will provide financial assistance from the Community budget for the reception , the integration and the voluntary return of refugees , displaced persons and asylum-seekers which is a relevant instrument to give a human dimension to the asylum policy of the Union , as one Member of the House requested just a few moments ago .
in writing . - ( PL ) I voted in favour of adoption of the resolution on combating cancer as diseases of this type wreak havoc the world over , including the countries of the European Union and my home country , Poland .
their position and social standing is extremely well protected by various articles in the directive , right up to their training and professional qualifications .
I now note that the Council and Parliament have reached agreement on a board for the ECDC to consist of one representative per Member State , three from the Commission and two from Parliament .
this may be at the cost of the urgent attention still needed for prevention , for strengthening the health systems in developing countries and for long-term solutions to the problems , which means the development of an AIDS or malaria vaccine .
with the best will in the world , we were not able to do so .
the current state of play - and we would do well to remind ourselves of this again - is that there are in fact judgements from the European Court of Justice relating to employees , I refer in particular to those relating to the Rush Portuguesa case and that of van der Elst .
that market is confined to the European Union . It is not something that appertains to the whole world .
much has changed in the 50 years that separate the Treaty of Rome and the Declaration of Berlin .
I should like to point out that the new Corporate Operational Plan , which covers the period 2001-2003 , redefines our priorities along the lines proposed in recommendations 3 and 5 .
written statements ( Rule 149 )
to which of the Rules of Procedure does your point relate ?
as a result of this Sakharov Prize , I have started a trust fund to invest in education , because I think that is the way forward .
I share the rapporteur &apos;s view that not all kinds of investments require the same high level of protection and that , for example , short-term speculative investments do not deserve the same level of protection as long-lasting investments .
we have our reservations about the content of Mr Mantovani &apos;s report .
Shirin Ebadi &apos;s persecution is not an isolated incident .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start by reminding you that Parliament has already criticised the enormous delays in implementing the second generation Schengen Information System ( SIS II ) .
I would be grateful if the Commission could use this positive definition in future .
the principle of reciprocity must be respected , because that is the only way to achieve a balanced outcome of the negotiations .
imperialist infighting has been temporarily covered up in order to launch an even greater onslaught on workers &apos; rights and freedoms , and to stage an increase in monopoly profits .
we therefore voted on the Elles report without knowing exactly what we were voting on .
with elections pending for December of this year , the key political leaders are unable to participate in dialogue , inhibiting the democratic process .
we have been working on the basic process of possible amendments to the existing European legislation .
in any event , however , it is also very probable that the elections scheduled for 2006 may have to be brought forward to 2005 for the reasons I have just explained .
we need these extra resources to repeat the successes , like the extension of the primary health care system to 80 % of Afghans - including far better treatment for women and girls - and recent success in turning provinces poppy free .
however , I recognize that we have serious ethical considerations in this directive .
however , this is a matter for its own people and does not warrant foreign intervention .
indeed , the European Parliament itself has always insisted that a pact on employment is required , since the stability pact urgently needs something to counterbalance it .
beyond rural development , the report also addresses issues related to EU trade and agricultural policy .
I would say to the ministers and also to the officials - although I know that this is unusual - that they really need to change their attitude and their approach .
while the EU &apos;s competencies in this sphere are not extensive , it should intervene wherever possible , such as through the ERDF , to ensure that decent housing is provided .
the agreement between Italy and Libya is much more complex : it is a treaty with precise conditions regarding more complex issues than joint coastal patrols .
first observation : we have an institutional problem .
it would be a colossal enterprise to set up when the problem , in reality , lies elsewhere .
so you see that , from this standpoint , all of us , including the presidency which , as the President-in-Office has just pointed out , is making this a priority , have tried to ensure that a certain number of Commission proposals are transformed into action after they have passed before the Council and Parliament , so that we can look ahead to this conference at least with an easy conscience .
southern Italy and the Mediterranean have been left on the fringe of a genuine growth and stability strategy .
I do not need a plea for this .
but , as everybody expected oil prices to come down to USD 9 per barrel , the world was late , and now we know that we should follow this policy .
the Fianna Fail MEPs reluctantly voted in favour of this proposal .
finally , any incentives to remain in work should , as a precondition , include safety valves to overcome any barriers which might prevent young people from accessing the labour market , especially at a time when unemployment has , unfortunately , soared to invisible heights .
I should like to welcome Mr Oreja and wish him a happy New Year , and ask him to reply to Mr Vallvé &apos;s question .
we must remember this .
what would agriculture be without energy ?
this is an important issue and should be resolved before accession negotiations commence .
but the current crisis in the process of integration shows that the method has had its day .
this group , as has already been said here , probably did not have only trade goals , but also aims relating to power politics , as , for example , its opposition to real or imagined US unilateralism .
what I miss , though , is an action plan .
if modulation must be applied to all axes , then we must also pay close attention to the level of their appropriations .
Mr President , my group , the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , has tabled a resolution which has the support of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and large parts of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament .
we need money for this and we need the money to be properly and fairly distributed .
these women are active participants in this process and we live in the same world as they do .
it is clear that the two questions are linked .
fourthly , we want Europeans not to be distracted from their common commitment to a more just world order , in which law for all replaces force exerted by the few .
if decisions in the Council required unanimity , that would not happen .
the Austrian delegation &apos;s support for it is expressly subject to the condition enunciated by Mrs Doyle and given on the basis of Commissioner Kyprianou ’ s statement .
that is why the initiative of launching the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All is a very constructive one .
that is quite unacceptable .
this is a commitment which needs to be implemented within five years .
fourthly , it is particularly important that there should be more awareness-raising campaigns in order to convince all relevant target groups that undeclared work needs to be combated .
the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Security and Defence Policy has , nevertheless , identified its priorities for the budget .
if I may cite a few examples , satellite-guided air traffic control will make the work of flight controllers easier , thereby ensuring greater passenger safety .
a great deal has been promised .
Thalys is the right model for Europe , as it is characterised by European rail cooperation that complies with the statutes protecting workers and with maximum safety rules .
furthermore , the sums allocated for agriculture include an increase of EUR 14 billion for promoting rural development and EUR 300 million for supporting dairy producers who have been hit very hard by the economic and financial crisis .
about ten thousand British soldiers are stationed in an area amounting to approximately four per cent of the territory of the island , known as sovereign British bases .
but I am sure that we will still have needs , especially on the financial management side .
all of this is very complex but we must be careful about how we present matters .
the Council , for all its faults , at least contains representatives of Member States .
I want it to reinstate the Human Rights Commission .
however , the moment that has been chosen to do this comes at a very difficult time .
some of the amendments are still very controversial .
almost 50 % of the human blood and blood plasma needed in the European Union has to be imported , mainly from the USA .
outstanding commitments remain the biggest problem with the EU budget .
thank you very much , Mrs Berès , for your initiative , and thanks to all of those who have said that they want to attempt to make progress on behalf of people who , as we all know , deserve protection .
because most forests are damaged by discharges which come from a long way away , responsibility for the air and climate is global and European .
but , Commissioner , I am very grateful to you for your answer and that you want to raise the matter during the talks with Poland .
no , thank you , Mr President .
thank you , Mr de Silguy , for attending and for your responses .
unfortunately , despite long negotiations with the Commission and the Council , the latter agreed to a figure of only 115.5 billion , that is , 0.99 of the GNP of the European Union .
Europe is at a crossroads .
in 2010 , we witnessed the three greatest humanitarian catastrophes in recent years : the earthquake in Haiti ; the drought in the Sahel ; and the floods in Pakistan .
this shows that agriculture should not be depicted as an environmental villain .
it is also important to keep abreast of developments in training techniques .
on the specific question of relations with the national parliaments or your Parliament , the proposal to incorporate a reference to closer association between Member State parliaments was not accepted . This was because of pressure by a number of developing countries that were not really in favour of the idea and because of the American position , which could be described as reluctant , to say the least .
these are not a random collection of disparate items .
this morning we are of course mainly concerned with the first part .
there is an obvious need for solidarity between generations , between social partners , between more developed countries and less developed countries in the areas of security , disaster relief and so on .
I have to emphasise this , as things are not going well for us . They are not going well for me and they are not going well for the Commission either .
the local population , however , despite suffering from the loss of material goods and of loved ones , is rolling up its sleeves and rebuilding its future .
our point of view - because we have discussed this question in the ITRE committee as well as within our group - is that it should be a matter of voluntary responsibility .
we must begin by harmonizing quite distinct areas of judicial cooperation .
the Commission has submitted proposals in this area .
my thanks go also to the Commission ’ s staff and , of course , to my fellow-Members as well .
that is where the contradiction in your statement lies .
I think he gives an excellent answer to all the questions of concern to the European Union here .
the last point concerns infringements .
therefore we regard the spheres of education and culture as particularly important in an age where nations are planning to draw close together .
we recognise that current public procurement rules are really suited to the particular needs of the defence procurement .
then again , even if Iraq were armed , what right would we have to deprive it of all means of defending itself ?
this chance is now already small enough , particularly in those countries which will not be permitted to join the single currency .
in my opinion , both components of this strategy offer scope for further development .
EUR 6 million has been allocated to the Special Olympic Games , with a provision for further funding to be provided in 2011 .
we have to act here with some sort of morality and say : OK , maybe the underspend will pay for it but we actually have to find a way .
it is true that times have changed , and today we can all enjoy extensive liberties , but we must also remember those who restricted that freedom .
I also wanted to take this opportunity to say goodbye to Mr Santer as President of the Commission , as I believe that this is the last debate he is going to attend .
I refer in particular to the moisture content of cereals and the monthly increments .
I had noticed what the British Minister of State , Denis McShane , my old school mate , said yesterday in the region .
as well as the many good proposals , the White Paper unfortunately contains seriously mistaken evaluations .
at present , European citizens are effectively being denied their right to free movement during their working lives and during retirement because of the patchwork of national pension systems .
is the impression correct , which you also may have gained , that the necessary solidarity within the Arabian area itself was not forthcoming because of the Israeli crisis and the opinion of many Arab countries that America had applied too little pressure in the days leading up to the crisis ?
the ratio of 90 / 10 proposed by the Commission made it possible to produce a natural flavour with tastes differing according to the products , targets or the culture of Member States .
the concerted actions of the United Nations institutions have played an important role here , as has the Bretton Woods system .
I took soundings in the press where I heard very many concerns from Lithuania about this settlement .
what does the EU mean to them and what does it offer ?
the report deals with some very important issues related to regulation of the organisation of sport , and emphasises its economic dimension .
the answer to this question is often determined by the choices we make .
in view of the limited funding available , it is important to establish which goals and priorities should be focused on , for example the development of small and medium-sized enterprises in the global economy , whilst at the same time safeguarding environmental protection and job security .
at times we remember this and smile .
clearly , voluntary selfregulation is not sufficient .
let us make real efforts , within the framework of EU 2020 , to bring about a compelling investment rail project which will be good for the individual citizen , good for the environment and good for employment .
&quot; Credit rating agencies will not be subject to EU regulation for the present , said Internal Market Commissioner Charlie McCreevy in a speech in Dublin on 5 April 2005 .
solidarity is important .
I am delighted that the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , and now Parliament as a whole , has adopted paragraph 15 with its positive wording concerning European states ’ , especially Ukraine ’ s , future opportunities to become members of the EU .
the only people above all suspicion are the rulers of the ÅU and the USA .
this matter could have been corrected in the Maastricht Treaty .
it is a very serious issue in the Scottish farming industry .
I have one minute left , which I would like to use to briefly address another point , that being parental leave , which has also given rise to vigorous debate among us .
as we all know , if this programme is not applied as broadly as proposed in Mrs Gröner &apos;s report , we shall not be able to limit either superficially or materially the phenomenon of violence that is present at all social levels , violence which is spreading its social fabric and constantly extending to the large social groups now facing it and that is why I think that the European Union should step up its efforts .
that is why I am in total agreement with the position stated by Pierre Moscovici and what I would say today is that we shall not help to bring about peace by taking sides in the debate and in the difficult negotiations under way .
ladies and gentlemen , I am not talking about a definitive reform of the European institutions , but of a reform that is far-reaching enough to prevent the institutions being deadlocked or choked , a reform far-reaching enough , as a Member of Parliament said the other day , to enable further development in future .
I should like to conclude by asking you , on behalf of my group , for a separate vote on section 4 of the resolution .
how does Europe intend to keep its human resources , which are so essential to innovation in Europe &apos;s schools , universities and research centres ?
and if we forget to do this , if we neglect this word and this value , the citizens will distance themselves from us .
pending its entry into force , the trade provisions of the PCA are being implemented by means of an interim agreement .
we can also already see that , internationally , these discussions are not characterised solely by a will to find common ground , or else Canada and Russia , for example , would not have attempted to block the EU &apos;s observer status in the Arctic Council .
I do not want to spend any more time talking about the issue of the institutions .
it is also necessary to implement a restructuring of competences in order to provide greater coherence and coordination in responses to disasters by the EU .
a single framework greatly enhances the coherence of the EU &apos;s external action : the new Treaty implies a major step forward when compared to the existing arrangements .
the rest is simply a brazen lie kept alive by Heads of Government afraid of their own people .
in fact , the euro is coming into the world after having been on a diet for several years and after following a strict fitness programme .
it is also vital that effective initiatives are taken in Nigeria and elsewhere to stop Taylor from continuing to interfere in Liberian affairs and destabilise other countries in the region .
reading between the lines , we can see its true purpose - to create a climate that is most favourable to entrepreneurial activity .
this is surely some mistake !
as the sun of freedom and democracy rises over the Middle East , clouds of division are hampering European unity and the ability to take responsibility .
the decision on all this will be implemented through different UN agencies , EuronAid and FAO for the food security component and different NGOs for the de-mining operations .
the Hungarian Presidency is strongly convinced that the newly adopted - not revised - Hungarian constitution is fully in line with the basic values and principles on which the Union is founded .
no prisoner has escaped or tried to do so .
on 17 October 2003 , Mr Alvaro Gil-Robles , the Council of Europe ’ s Commissioner for Human Rights , published a recommendation on ‘ Certain aspects of law and practice relating to sterilisation of women in the Slovak Republic ’ . The recommendation states that there has been no organised policy in this area .
in the field of human rights , all the reports from the OSCE support group , from the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and from the various NGOs continue to give cause for concern .
it has been felt that it is more appropriate that , instead of the outgoing Commission , the new Commission takes a clear position on this issue because the new Commission will be in charge of defending or promoting the EU position at the conference .
so , even if there were a possibility , I think that would represent only five tonnes of opium production .
you cannot have your fudge cake and eat it by denying such inherent flexibility in the Treaty .
I am pleased that the directive has taken into consideration the specific protection measures that are already in place in some Member States , and I say that with particular reference to Denmark , which applies strict standards for pesticides on account of the fact that groundwater is used directly as drinking water .
we do not question Iran &apos;s right to the peaceful development of nuclear energy , nor do we intend to underestimate the important role that Iran can play on a regional level , its legitimate security requirements , or the need to create a credible system of regional security that involves all the nuclear powers in the area .
the European Parliament has been duped and I was one of those who fell into the trap .
how can the European Union condemn itself to zero growth in a crucial sector in which production worldwide is increasing by 5 % per annum ?
military spending reached USD 956 billion two years ago , and last year the figure topped USD 1 trillion .
Mr Duisenberg referred to &apos; frontloading &apos; , which is the advance circulation of low denomination notes in automatic cash machines .
unfortunately , all of these terrible things can also take place in our society here in the EU .
in principle , the recognition of social rights as human rights cannot be questioned either , since there is no human dignity without basic security .
in this context , allow me to lay special emphasis on the measures connected to citizenship , particularly those related to culture and to young people .
Mr President , we have a problem , because the whole House is asking the Commission to revise the legislative package on these matters , and Mr Barrot has , very charmingly as always , told us that this goes back a long way , that it has been debated a great deal and that on 1 January , it will begin to operate .
it is the first time that Article 138b of the EC Treaty has been used as a call for legislation .
the complicated part is that hundreds of specifications feature on this non-exhaustive list of cultural goods attached to the draft ; games , leisure activities and sports , culinary traditions , costumes , cultural tourism , pottery , textiles , embroidery , baskets , glassware , jewellery , leather goods , wood , metal , furniture , interior decorating , designer goods , and the list goes on .
such problems stem from a hard working life and high unemployment .
the next item is the voting on objections concerning the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance .
we need to recognise the effects and risks of reprocessing , shipment and reshipment on everyone , not just the countries of origin and destination that are making money from the nuclear business .
that does not mean that she has washed her hands of it , far from it ; she has done a fine job of work , and I would like to thank her warmly for it .
I will be presenting this package to the Council of Fisheries Ministers in Luxembourg on 24 June with the intention of adopting a formal proposal on this subject as early as July .
the inclusion of the European Parliament in the legislative decision-making process was one of the hallmarks of the British presidency .
the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance would have liked to have seen somewhat more thorough work , in particular , as regards protecting the victims of human trafficking .
there are plenty of measures out there which are being completely unimplemented by Member States .
I agree completely with my colleague , Mrs Hirsch , on that point .
total social harmonisation .
a further 150,000 civilians have been killed since then .
nonetheless , I believe that agreement will be reached in Copenhagen .
this is a very retrograde step and will be used as a pretext to return to violence by extremists .
that is impossible , because Parliament will always have the last word when the negotiations are concluded .
regrettably , however , the institutional framework and the acrimonious relations between the two main political parties do not bode well for a peaceful and democratic electoral process .
I commend the electorate of the Irish Republic for exercising good sense in the first referendum , sense that I believe that they will show once again in the second one .
let us wait for the results of the referendum , and here we must support the United Nations by doing all we can to ensure that the referendum takes place at all .
there are many outstanding issues but , with the conclusions adopted at the Brussels Summit , the European Council has clarified matters regarding the maximum expenditure on the market-related area and direct payments for the budget period up to 2013 .
it is the case that , thirteen months ago , Parliament delivered its opinion on services of general interest by a well-supported vote , with 435 votes being cast in the final vote .
in other words , biotechnology has many benefits , and this is widely recognised .
we must respond to this situation with increased cross-border cooperation and intensive checks in border regions .
the first is that what is ultimately being fabricated is not a Europe of social cohesion and solidarity ; it is marketplace Europe and , secondly , in certain instances , enlargement policy has problematic relations with international law .
as the Union does not want to impose decisions on the individual Member States , this is an attempt to coordinate their policies .
the adoption of the action plan between the European Union and the twelve States bordering the Mediterranean is a step forwards in the much-needed creation of a Mediterranean free trade area , which I would call a genuine form of discreet enlargement towards the South .
therefore , I think that it is important that we all support adequate funding for research and innovation in the EU budget ; we should not say we support it in this meeting and vote against it in the budget meetings .
there can be no tolerance of modern-day slave traders .
Mr President , the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is very happy with the content of Mr Tannock ’ s report , but we would have liked to see a few conceptual improvements to it .
lastly , let me express my warmest thanks to Mrs Gurmai for her outstanding work .
now that the Member States have recognised , at the behest of the European Parliament , that the declarations they are being asked to provide are necessary , we can look forward to a very successful Court of Auditors .
our attempt at finding air transport a place in the logic of optimising transport overall could not , unfortunately , be enshrined in the Regulation on slots .
there is no doubt , however , that , while the fight against the funding of terrorism is a vital instrument for preventing terrorism , this fight cannot undermine or limit a fundamental right , such as that of customers to have their personal financial data protected .
compensatory payments for less favoured regions made under the common agricultural policy also benefit mountain regions in many cases .
for this , however , the international community must be fully committed , and the UN mandate renewed , as some countries have suggested .
for example , the Directive on Unfair Commercial Practices ( UCP ) aims at protecting consumers , including young people , from practices that harm their economic interests , such as misleading advertising or aggressive practices .
the Commission should therefore review its proposal and identify specifically those situations where European legislation is called for .
Commissioner , a system has emerged here that continues to benefit those who already ensure that large concerns pay less and less tax and who are now apparently giving up paying tax .
this is appealing and necessary .
you will understand , Mrs de Sarnez , ladies and gentlemen , that I am not at liberty to divulge the details now , but we will most certainly take account of the many ideas contained in Mrs de Sarnez &apos;s report .
Madam President , those who are familiar with Russian politics and style are well aware of the fact that we can achieve more results using a more realistic , pragmatic policy that is more ready to compromise , than by exerting pressure .
I , too , in the 20 seconds I have left , Mr President , will take advantage of this last-day-of-school atmosphere to thank my classmates and those with whom I have had occasion to work over the last ten years , since I now have the great pleasure of ending my final day in Strasbourg with my last but by no means least contribution .
as the Commission knows , current market prices penalise Europeans for being outside their country of origin , and the prices charged for roaming calls also vary for users from different European states .
Italian Members submitted further proposals at today &apos;s plenary session , including broadening the regulation to encompass shoes as well .
innocent civilians are the one who suffer and their feeling of security is very seriously undermined by these attacks .
in my opinion , the solution can be found in the quote of Goethe .
the Portuguese Presidency has always tried to maintain a frank , open and constructive relationship with the European Parliament , both with the plenary and its committees .
if we do not succeed in applying pressure and making it clear that we need new institutions specifically in order to support the poorest countries in the world , then we will still be sitting here after Pittsburgh pointing out that , ultimately , nothing has changed .
how is it , I would ask the rapporteur , that payments can fall so far short of commitments ?
( applause )
on 8 March , International Women ’ s Day was celebrated throughout the world , and I would therefore like , on behalf – I believe – of all of the Members of this Parliament , to take this opportunity to express today before Parliament our rejection of the violence perpetrated by the police against a group of women who were demonstrating peacefully in favour of their rights in Tehran .
the first results should be evident as soon as 2005 , and upon further research , it now emerges that too little has happened in this field .
once again , this year we have found major irregularities .
rapporteur . - ( ES ) Thank you , Mr President .
this country , which was part of the former Soviet Union and gained independence in 1991 , has still not fully broken away from the practices of the former Communist regime , though of course efforts have been made to do so .
henceforth , international corridors linking the Member States will be managed by cross-border authorities which coordinate infrastructure management and slot allocation .
the Presidency is committed and will do everything to reach these targets .
my scepticism stems mainly from the fact that more nuclear power stations are to be built in order to reduce CO2 emissions .
the evil empire created by Stalin was unacceptable , even though before then the victory over Nazi ideology had been jointly celebrated .
the implementation of aid aimed at retraining and reintegrating these workers into the work market is crucial , not only for the economy to pick up , but also for social stability .
in other words , businesses should not bear the responsibility for the shortcomings of administrative cooperation between Member States .
 
dispute between the EU and the USA
during the meeting with Mr Verhofstadt , the latter made two interesting pledges .
I should like to ask you to take on board the views of those who know more about children in the developing world than perhaps you or I do , and who are concerned about the fact that we are perceived as a Union that concentrates more on large infrastructural projects than on children , and perhaps to think more deeply about the needs of children in terms of medical care and other assistance .
will the Commission comment on how it is seeking to achieve a fair balance between respect for fundamental freedoms and measures to combat terrorism ?
we welcome him here , we accept him here because his voice is also necessary in this debate .
I could not end , Mr Commissioner , without expressing my pleasure on hearing your proposals a few moments ago in which you expressed the view of the Commission which would , you mentioned , support the inclusion in the annex to the new treaty of a specific statement on the arrangements for island regions .
although they could have done it straight away , back in 1991 , the Iraqi Government did not take steps to set up an arrangement with the UN before 1995 , when Iraq agreed to the &apos; oil for food &apos; facility as set out in the UN Security Council resolution that year .
thank you very much , Mr Chichester .
we want an independent Bank .
furthermore , the privacy of users and creativity must also be guaranteed .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start by thanking Mrs Roure for her work on this report .
firstly , there is no legal basis for that kind of measure .
this improves budget control and transparency .
many airlines have made improvements under a voluntary agreement .
we are now only a couple of months away from the final deadline for transposition by the Member States of the directive on payment services .
at the same time , the whole of the Serbian minority in Kosovo remains just as vulnerable to acts of terrorism committed by Albanian extremists .
.
the Commission takes note of the decision to postpone the Sixth EU-Uzbekistan Parliamentary Cooperation Committee meeting and regrets that the delegation would not be allowed to travel to the Andijan region nor to have unrestricted access to members of the opposition , non-governmental organisations and the independent media .
but when somebody accuses me of behaving like the policeman presenting corrupt evidence , I have to say that I regard that as an attack on my honesty and my honour .
this regulation will make sure that hydrogen-based systems are as safe as the conventional propulsion technologies , contributing to the stimulation of industry for building such type of vehicles .
it was clear that a considerable number of Heads of Government regard it as extremely important to find a fair and acceptable solution to this question , bearing in mind that the majorities to be obtained must be seen to be legitimate .
consequently , the specific measures intended to promote equality between men and women , women ’ s independence and their role in the economic , social and environmental spheres make significant contributions as well as being a matter of fairness .
Parliament should say so , loud and clear , to the Council of Ministers .
ladies and gentlemen , I see this as a mark of respect for the linguistic pluralism of this House .
as usual in EU nomenclature , the title conveys the opposite of reality .
if we compare the past with the current complex programme , we can see the hard work that has been done .
despite the fact that it holds itself up as the moral police force of the world , it is murdering people every year - and thinks that is right .
while this programme does not specifically target women , it supports equality of men and women and the participation of diverse civil society groups and associations at local grassroots level in the process of strengthening democratic structures .
the role and competences of the institutions are laid down in the Treaties .
clearly , therefore , we must also adopt a position on this issue at European level .
however , this new incident and this new crime in the Middle East is , in fact , evidence of general developments and ongoing intolerance of religious freedom and lack of respect for those who are different .
I find the guidelines set out by the Commission interesting because they could lead to a less simplistic understanding of Member States ’ public finances .
naturally , it is not perfect , far from it , but until now , it is the best .
you will see that it contains significant and detailed legally binding commitments on the way that the US Treasury Department can process data under the agreement .
in the area of cooperation in criminal matters , there is a possibility that still remains , which is that a quarter of European Union governments can take initiatives in this area .
but I think we are not being careful enough about the various concepts involved .
that is why the Communist Party of Greece is against the proposed agreement and is doing everything it can to coordinate the grass-roots fight in every country for international trade based on mutual benefit of equal value to all .
we need this to be a study which tells us of the shady side of what proclaims itself to be a respectable trade .
we were able to work together productively , each putting forward his or her own points of view , and I would like to thank them for that .
perhaps , with regard to the intentions declared , but it all seems very hazy to contemplate setting a date by which the Union will be able to be an autonomous political entity with foreign and security policies .
it is imperative that the validation of alternative and non-animal tests be speeded up and simplified .
thirdly , the techniques , costs , etc. and financing of decommissioning .
I am glad that we have achieved this result and that we will therefore be giving this our 314 votes at tomorrow &apos;s sitting .
but generally Parliament was excluded from the whole process of setting up regional funding . When we are talking about a large proportion of European expenditure that is entirely unacceptable .
it is very important to go on holding legal seminars .
there are shortages of essential foodstuffs and agricultural infrastructure resulting in severe nutritional deficiencies .
this Parliament spends many session hours every month on fundamental human rights in countries outside of Europe .
it is in the interest of all of us that the take-up of this programme be good .
perhaps you could find out and let us know .
we are not asking to have power over the committees , we just want to have a look at the work they are doing .
however , generally speaking the Heads of Government felt that the Conference had made excellent progress , and the round-table discussions looked at a number of different subjects . Among these was the review , which covered the inclusion of more specific provisions on human rights in the Treaty , the introduction of the principle of non-discrimination , a chapter on employment , the reintroduction and consolidation of the social protocol and the removal of the United Kingdom &apos;s opt-out , a new legal basis for openness and transparency , the consolidation of the European Parliament &apos;s legislative role and the simplification of procedures , the extension of the powers of the Court of Justice - particularly under the third pillar , and the combating of fraud .
they knew which people were laundering money .
the section of this amendment concerning the submission of a report to Parliament is fully in line with current practice , and can be accepted by the Commission .
the problem is the result of that financing . The result is that production has doubled .
Mr President , I recommend a vote against Amendment No 12 .
I want very briefly to emphasise a number of points .
we thought too that account should have been taken of the findings of an evaluation study , because we now have the excellent monitoring centre for drugs .
in a world that is becoming ever smaller and better connected by sophisticated methods of communication , a world in which islands of wealth , peace and well-being are surrounded by poverty , war and destitution , considerable migratory pressures from the less-favoured regions are inevitably brought to bear on wealthier parts of the world .
I have thus voted in favour of the Council &apos;s recommendations for the conclusion of the new partnership agreement with Seychelles .
Mr President , honourable Members , I wish to make a statement on behalf of the Commission .
the fact is that we often know nothing about how MFA is handled once it is transferred directly into the budget of the beneficiary country &apos;s central bank .
there are probably few people around who could really understand it .
I have just one supplementary .
I also think that the issue of air traffic control and of everything involved with the regulation and safety of air traffic are tasks that are the responsibility of the public authorities , who should be considered as public services .
I did not want to point the finger at any specific country .
it must act quickly to establish a consistent and effective immigration policy .
not all my colleagues , however , have taken such a responsible view of the matter .
I refrained from voting , owing to the fact that I am unfamiliar with the details of the amendments to the said motion for a resolution .
subject : London buses
it is not coincidental at all , because it all concerns the question : are we going to take a new initiative or not .
the Community has various instruments at its disposal to help improve access to reliable data , in particular public sector data , in the first place , and later standardise it to make it comparable at Community level .
it must be able to allow a more expansive economic policy in times of crisis so that it is possible to escape from the economic crisis .
it is therefore very important , in addition to having measures of a regulatory nature , to develop an active policy of combating trafficking in human beings , because such trafficking constitutes , above all , the exploitation of a great deal of misery , poverty and fear , by organisations which are highly efficient and who not only traffic in human beings but also engage in other criminal activities .
for that reason , we need good governance as well as democracy if we are to combat corruption .
a new project has already been planned for , concerning satellite communications - also coming to be regarded as a common interest sector .
that is why the Commission is not in a position to accept your amendment aimed at extending this maximum rate reserved for cross-border sections to natural barriers .
the Community must assert itself , uphold its uniqueness and be proud of the guiding role it continues to have in this process .
it is precisely at such times that we need to ban this sort of weapons system and , more importantly , to strengthen international law .
Croatia and Bulgaria have refused to sign .
these are the reasons why I shall be voting &quot; no &quot; if no far-reaching change is to take place . Firstly , your Commission reveals a democratic deficit , Mr Prodi .
may I say that in fact two speeches have just been made in the Chamber ...
on the matter of copyright , the Commission is organising a workshop in the next few weeks on digital rights management technologies .
that is why the Commission supports a limited change to Article 136 of the Treaty .
my group stresses the importance of strict budgetary discipline .
however , that is of little use to the fishermen if , as the previous speaker says , they find themselves before the courts .
we believe that this study should contribute to an increased understanding of volunteering in sports , in both societal and economic terms , as a basis for responding to the political demand to promote voluntary activities in sport and its underlying structure in an EU context .
in other words , in the context of this Seventh Framework Programme we are facing an attempt to commercialise research , to the detriment of public research .
Madam President , the increasing prevalence of allergies and other diseases caused by impurities in the air shows that air pollution is a growing problem .
this must come to an end .
in this way , the scope for fraud is reduced , licences become more forgery-proof , and we may be sure that the driver of a bus or of a vehicle carrying hazardous materials is qualified to drive that particular vehicle .
what he did not reveal , however , is that two thirds of these savings have simply been transferred to the 2013 or 2012 financial year , so that we will have to decide what to do about this money next year .
swift ( debate )
in any event , I am in favour of this improved coordination and confirm my personal undertaking to make good use of these various tools for evaluating and monitoring the 1 500 directives associated with the functioning of the internal market .
mechanisms for monitoring to be carried out by the Commission , particularly for sensitive sectors in the event of increased imports , are also provided for .
thank you again , your Holiness , for your presence and your message .
what is needed , perhaps , is to think about another , more fundamental type of measure to provide alternative employment for these fishermen , for example , fishing in other waters in the medium term .
as I said , Amendment No 13 on the compilation and reporting of data is acceptable in principle .
faced with the scale of the disaster in Portugal , I was struck by the lack of resources on the ground .
the disintegration of the Soviet Union was the result of its own impossible situation , but our splendid European project deserves better .
it will also strengthen the integration of our own aviation sector as it will , of course , our negotiating position in relation to third countries .
the vote will take place tomorrow , Thursday , at 12 noon .
this is a first and important step in making Parliament a more effective voice for the people in EU decision-making .
the existence of a sector not subject to competition is , in effect , indispensable to the economic viability of the universal service .
the Union of the Europe of the Nations Group will therefore vote in favour of the proposal .
the same goes for development cooperation .
normally , as you very well know , I should not have taken that vote , because it is only possible to do that when the report is called in the agenda , and that is a time when the number of Members present is least .
it has repeatedly , and quite rightly , been said that Europe does not have a face .
so that is why I ask Mrs Gál to continue her excellent work .
I am very pleased by that and I hope that this House will do the same .
we must call upon the Union to take this decisive step at last .
he asked me to mention that ultimately , at second reading , this regulation represents a compromise , a good compromise in his view , but there are nevertheless still a few issues that will need further work .
the Council reiterated its conclusions of December 2000 regarding the measures to take with regard to the Erika .
Mr President , on a point of order .
firstly , when I came to this Parliament many years ago I was told that if you had a difficult job you gave it to a Liberal .
the European Parliament ’ s attention is focused on the arrested opposition leaders and we are demanding their immediate release .
in assassinating Marco Biagi , the terrorists had in their sights a man who was highly regarded both professionally and personally , and a creator of the indispensable policy of labour market reform to promote employment in Italy and in Europe .
I would ask the Commissioner therefore to monitor this affair very closely , as it is of great significance for all communities and inhabitants in the region .
 
this will be a big opportunity for Bangladesh and the other least-developed countries to present themselves not as patients on a sick bed in hospital , with the rest of the world looking at them like curious doctors , but as partners in the global society , representing cultures and potentials which are important in keeping alive the diversity of globalisation .
he stressed that point several times in his contribution .
pursuant to Article 82 , we want the OLAF regulation to be supplemented with a clause which provides for the appointment of a public prosecutor with powers limited to punishable offences committed by the members and staff of the European Union in respect of the budget .
the movement of people , ideas , goods , the end of certain great totalitarian empires , the crumbling of walls and iron curtains represent real progress overall .
has the Union now got a decision-making system which is capable of strengthening the work in the field of justice and home affairs ?
given that the opposition alliance is fragile , outside support for its aims might convince the population that a change of government could mean a step towards more democracy .
the consumer ?
in this respect , it inspires passionate sentiments , as has been pointed out and as we have just heard a moment ago .
I would just like to tell you about the French situation , where we have a law which is currently being implemented for local elections .
the more public transport relies on the market , the smaller its chance of survival becomes .
that was the approach that the Committee on Regional Policy took , and there are , essentially , three things that I would like to address .
I wish you the best of luck , Commissioner , in your new role .
in fact , this is a crisis which is not of the poor countries &apos; own making , but they are the ones being hardest hit by it .
even quite recently , European Union Member States regarded energy as an issue to be resolved at the national and not at the European Union level .
EASA must also be able to take decisive action and that depends on the structure , but also on the quality of the managers .
in this report , we have attached the utmost importance to the question of the role played by women in the work done .
there is still a lot to do on the social and economic front and the European Union must help new states catch up and provide the means to create unity within the European Union .
there can be no economic progress or investment while lawlessness is rife .
at the same time , this also demonstrates that it is not possible to have a zero dioxin value .
if you are expecting the people of the United Kingdom to make any sort of arrangement for their lifeblood , the very lifeblood of the nation state , and to base it on people who have no fundamental interest in the wellbeing of the United Kingdom , I can tell you that it will not happen .
we have seen a host of action plans and plans for reform over the last four years .
I believe that the forthcoming visit by President Bush offers a wonderful opportunity to restore that strategic alliance , that harmonious partnership between the European Union and the United States , and to ensure that the values we both advocate – including human rights and fundamental freedoms – can be taken on in all regions of the world , be consolidated and be truly effective .
Madam President , Members of the European Parliament , I am very happy to be able to appear before you and speak for the first time in the European Parliament as Finland &apos; s Prime Minister .
what we need now of course is for these priorities to be accepted by the Committee on Budgets and by Parliament as a whole , with any modifications which the Committee on Budgets may have to make .
misleading business directories ( debate )
our bilateral relations are based on a solid foundation of around 20 important and over 100 smaller sector-specific agreements .
I believe , Mr President , that the Committee on Citizens ’ Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , until the day it voted on this report in committee , voted and worked as it has done over the last five years , that is to say , in a reasonable and sensible way , listening – something which I believe is not very common in this Parliament today – listening to each others arguments .
Liechtenstein has been steadily integrating into the European trade area since its accession to the European Economic Area ( EEA ) in 1995 .
for example , we will send a delegation to Sierra Leone in August ; I will not be surprised if there are very few takers .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , Sir Robert Atkins has , in my view , compiled a sound report .
it is a priority to understand what happened at that level and thereby avoid repetition of the errors of the past .
nonetheless , I will repeat this again and again : we still have work to do on this matter .
what is of importance now is for a fact-finding mission to visit Iraq and to give a more definite picture of the possibilities for EU action .
Burundi has been selected as a pilot country with a view to implementing the Council conclusions of November 2007 , this has been mentioned , and I am delighted that is has been so selected .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , first I should like to say that I support , as does my Group , the decision which has been taken to postpone Croatia &apos;s admission to the Council of Europe .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
I believe that this directive will brook no delay .
( applause )
at the same time , however , we know that the decreasing number of contributors , the increase in expenditure on public health systems and the tightening of budgets in response to the convergence criteria are difficult to reconcile .
it is up to us , the people and states , and the European Parliament , to make the euro into a great shared house and not an unfinished tower of Babel .
I would like to underline one thing that I think is important when we are discussing the policy for supporting innovation : there is no better precondition and no better basis for innovation than competition .
we can finally say that we have come up with a decent document allowing us , the European Union , to proceed in a fairly reasonable manner , taking into account all the interests of all stakeholders .
I voted in favour of the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) in favour of the Netherlands because I consider that instrument to be a valuable resource for the support of workers in difficulties on account of the economic crisis .
she has been extremely sensitive to the different points of view expressed and , true to her nature , she has defended the interests of the consumers and users with pugnacity .
nevertheless , until the WTO includes in its debate the international system of geographical indications and thus until we have an international register of geographical indications , it does not make much sense for the modifications of our Community Regulation to go any further than is strictly necessary .
let us hope that the arduous process of ratifying this Treaty has finally come to an end .
the vote will take place shortly .
( HU ) The Szigetköz , lying partly in Austria and Slovakia and the Hungarian stretch of the Danube , is one of the most beautiful areas in Europe .
for Croatian to be an official language , the Treaty has to be modified .
but if there were as many cars on the roads worldwide as there are in Europe , then the stock would be quintupled .
your presence here today is undoubtedly more than timely and I am therefore happy to extend our most cordial greetings to you .
they believe that it will allow farmers to focus on products that give them the best return on sales without having to keep an eye on the size of the subsidies given to the various products .
but should not the situation in France prompt the Commission to make it clear to the Council just how important social dialogue in Europe is ?
in any case , as I am also Vice-President responsible for multilingualism , I am going to try to talk to the interpreters , my friends the interpreters , to see how the term &apos; catch the eye &apos; can be translated into other languages .
the second interesting example is the e-EUROPE initiative , which incorporates five different specific lines of approach defining the needs of people with disabilities as regards access to all the new technologies and IT systems .
they have virtually no chance of promotion via continuing vocational training , and they have few leisure opportunities .
Mr President , I believe I speak for many other Members as I put the following question , which I hope the Commission can respond to .
my question is : are depleted uranium weapons being used in Kosovo ?
Mr President , as others have said before me , this directive is particularly important because it harmonizes patent law in the Member States in the area of biotechnological inventions , in order to clear up the legal uncertainties and to avoid the risk of it all falling apart .
the difficulty of this task lies in the fact that this validity is not only global and horizontal , but also individual and vertical : it extends from the Nobel Prize winner to the totally defenceless embryo , from the brain to individual body and gender cells .
frankly , when I listen to you , I feel as though I am listening to western intellectuals talking cheerfully , many decades ago , about the economic and social success in the countries of the USSR , with a complete inability to go and see what our shared values stand for in practice in those countries .
Mr President , I shall just comment on one point made in the report by the Committee of Independent Experts , which is chapter 5 , concerning fraud in the European Union .
if I had been asked ‘ what does a candidate like Mr Bemba represent ? ’ , I would have answered ‘ the hope of the Congo ’ , because all those who take part in an election represent the hope of their country , in this case above all because it was the first time that an election was being held .
the Lamassoure report ( A5-0133 / 2002 ) concerns the division of competences between the European Union and the Member States , something which constitutes one of the most basic issues for the Convention .
Mr President , I am very glad that the Commissioner has accepted all seven amendments .
Madam President , I voted against Mr Brinkhorst &apos;s report because in reality it seeks yet again to call in question the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure .
the Commission should therefore evaluate the possibility of merging agencies with overlapping or complementary activities .
volunteering needs financial and political support from all interested parties : non-government organisations , governments , administrative bodies of both national and local government , and businesses .
all major enterprises apply them and they work very well .
some say : &apos; Yes , but this Europe of asylum will be a beacon for unfounded asylum requests . &apos;
I do not know if you can speak Greek and understand my Greek .
what can , and should , Europe do about this depressing state of affairs ?
firstly , in accordance with the Subsidiarity Protocol , the Commission has to carry out consultations prior to each legislative proposal . Secondly , we need to take account of the views of all the varied organizations and associations which are so active in Europe , since they make a major contribution to the quality and feasibility of the initiatives .
we have to respect whatever this country wishes to call itself .
and farming is being turned into a sort of employment agency , with administration and control systems gaining in importance over good , professional practice .
they should not be stigmatised from birth , and should of course go to school regardless of their parents &apos; status , and should not be condemned to social exclusion .
another point is research .
there are victims in France and Spain and this evening we think of them and their families .
the joint motion for a resolution proves once again that the European Parliament , like all the EU institutions , represents a serious danger to grassroots freedoms and democratic rights .
in implementing and operating monetary union , we want to allow our Parliament to play the role which is its due under the Treaty .
yet EMAS-registered companies were not performing better , and the system of environmental excellence was weaker as compared with the ISO 14001 .
single-sector initiatives are needed – you referred to some of these yourself – in areas such as health services or social services of general interest , and cross-cutting initiatives are needed too .
.
respect for human life has to be at the forefront when we are drafting our immigration policy .
the lack of vision in the social sector is not limited solely to consumers .
given that the Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey is undoubtedly one of the most important events in the field of cooperation during our Presidency , Spain wishes to attach special priority to this event and this priority is reflected in the level of the official representation .
these are real issues raised by EU citizens themselves , and we ignore them at our peril .
Mr President , anyone who visited Uzbekistan during the Soviet era was enchanted by its glorious Islamic heritage , its thriving markets - especially compared with the markets elsewhere in the Soviet Union - and its lively atmosphere .
the report correctly pinpoints certain inadequacies of the proposed directive and we agree with some of the amendments .
along with the new possibilities for advertising , however , come new problems with hard sell , deception and the exploitation of gullible children and young people in the face of powerful assaults on their feelings .
this is very sad and this is why we specifically refer to that problem as one of the elements in the broader topic of the untying of aid .
I support what Mr Whitehead has said on nisin . I challenge the Commission to produce any evidence that it acts as an antibiotic .
as the problem is currently arising in different ways in several Member States , we are trying to develop a coherent method .
the European Union &apos; s budget , using subsidiarity as a pretext , is pushing this tendency even further by cutting social expenditure to a negligible level .
and we are talking of 2 , 500 employees .
in writing . - Mr Bono &apos;s report on the cultural industries in Europe calls for greater recognition of the industries &apos; contribution to the European economy .
I have heard Commissioner Frattini confirm the need to patrol our coastlines .
I support the call for access by public service broadcasting organizations to major sporting events .
there is a real problem in obtaining money for clinical trials .
this is a key issue : unless these values are respected , we may have a healthy economy , we may have jobs , but there will be no Europe .
atypical contract work is a growing trend which , if used in an efficient way , can result in a useful tool for escaping the current economic and social crisis .
what is more , such a defensive stance sends a most unfortunate message to the CEECs , to the other Europe .
( DE ) Mr President , the annual conference of NAFO made amendments to the Ottawa Convention of 1 January 1979 .
I represent London , which I think is the greatest city in the world , capital of the greatest country in the world .
it is having to invent common rules , a common mentality , a European approach to ethics , bit by bit .
I would like to ask the House why our cooperation with the United States has to be organised in this way .
the expiry of the Cohesion Fund at the turn of the millennium is another part of this equation .
I am afraid you have waited too long to express your objections and I urge you to do so earlier next time .
I must also make a reference to some small technical amendments that were introduced , after the services of the President of the sitting pointed out the need for them , to improve the legal quality and the visibility of the text adopted by the Committee on Employment and , at the same time , to enable us to bring our text into line with other texts adopted by Parliament , such as the minor technical amendments to Amendments Nos 10 and 2 , and the new Amendment No 18 .
an increase in support for biogas installations is to be rejected , however , in order to exclude the possibility that high-value foodstuffs will be wasted on fuel and energy production .
the term &apos; highly skilled labour &apos; should therefore be defined and common criteria for training should be standardised and established within the European Union .
if we are to get a common transport market genuinely up and running , it is important that we should not only have regulations but that these regulations should also , as far as possible , apply to every country .
derogations are good for dealing with minority problems , but when the exempted minority is in fact the majority it is time to change track .
an example of one such incident is the position recently adopted by Mr Schröder , the former German chancellor , on the construction of the gas pipeline along the bottom of the Baltic Sea .
otherwise , we will not be consistent .
this is particularly important in this period , when we are all working to strengthen the Lisbon Strategy and economic and social cohesion .
we must bring an immediate end to the impunity enjoyed by those who commit such abuses , and we must also ensure that the authorities do in fact respect human rights .
we were all very frank with one another .
in order to achieve a normal way of life , the Palestinian people need to create for themselves a state based on democratic institutions and the rule of law , which would ensure economic development .
( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , I agree with many of the arguments put forward by Mrs Thyssen , Mr Karas and Mrs Castex .
Mr President , Commissioner , may I give you a very deeply felt piece of unambiguous advice ?
we have no energy of our own .
the situation that has arisen today is , to a very large extent , due to immediate surroundings .
where , on the one hand , is there real financial support , and to what extent , on the other hand , are we resorting to the preamble of the PCA in order to ensure that measures are taken in those two countries to abolish the death penalty in law and in practice ?
that statistic speaks volumes ; we cannot continue to bury our heads in the sand .
guaranteed access for citizens to certain broadcasting services and certain types of content is a question of defining the public service broadcasting mandate and , in accordance with the Amsterdam Protocol , is therefore the responsibility of the Member States .
lastly , I wish to highlight the simplification achieved by cutting the number of arrangements from five to three , so that now there is a general arrangement , a special arrangement for sustainable development and good governance , and a special arrangement for the least developed countries ( ‘ Everything but Arms ’ – EBA ) .
I am glad that , after its initial emphasis on a police-based approach , the Commission is now moving forward with a much better overall approach .
this is not the situation we have at present , given the failure of the Lisbon Strategy .
we were also delighted to hear from the Minister that the Council is ready to seek a compromise and a way of reaching agreement .
we Greens hope that you will support the amendments to that effect that we tabled to the compromise resolution , so that we can vote for the compromise .
in terms of Parliament &apos;s role , we are not in favour of a temporary European Monitoring Platform under the auspices of Parliament , nor of the appointment of special rapporteurs within this as these proposals seem to involve activities that do not fall within the competence of a parliamentary assembly .
( DE ) Mr President , I just wanted to ask Mrs McCarthy whether the weapon she has with her is marked and registered and whether she has permission to bring it into the House .
I also believe that Parliament is adding a new important element which the Commission &apos;s proposal has omitted .
nevertheless , to effectively combat child pornography , it is necessary , in my opinion , for Europol to be immediately informed of cases of child pornography and for the exchange of information with the competent authorities to be carried out quickly and directly , as stated in Amendment No 20 from Gerhard Schmid .
between now and the meeting in Vienna under the Austrian presidency , we have four stages to work through in order to improve employment strategy .
we also welcome the strong emphasis on the need to identify and exchange good practices at European level .
it is very important to be able to protect both young girls and young boys against sexual crimes , sexual abuse and sexual exploitation throughout the EU .
we would ask the Commission for an independent and much stronger guarantee that , in the internal market , the principles of transparency and governance will be duly respected by all financial operators , including these funds , based on European and not solely national or international criteria .
the debate is closed .
the problem with the recycling target is that it can never absolutely suit all countries .
thank you .
this should be of concern not only when outrages are committed , but also when seeking to prevent and overcome a political culture which indirectly protects terrorism and its authors .
the issue of ongoing support of the educational process for the disabled and their carers is both a tremendous opportunity and a problem for families with disabled members .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
. Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , following a depression during the previous EU legislature and the previous US administration , the skies over the Atlantic Ocean seem to be brightening up .
such a permanent mechanism must minimise moral hazard and provide incentives for the Member States to pursue a responsible fiscal policy and incentives for investors to pursue responsible lending practices .
what we need is the rebirth , the resurgence , the re-emergence and the redevelopment of Haiti .
indeed , we suggest this 15 % in the explanatory memorandum as an indicative figure and stipulate in the regulation that particular emphasis must be given to these two fields .
this strategy could , I think , be called a peace dividend method .
I would also like to congratulate the Council on resolving the issues relating to the financing of the closure of Ignalina power station .
it is now nine years since the 1991 directive was produced and it is time to update it .
little was said at the summit about the problem of oil and how it curbs European growth .
to crown it all , it is actually dangling the idea of full employment , i.e. the creation of 20 to 30 million new jobs , before our noses .
most of them , however , did not want to stay ; they wanted to go to other European countries .
we do support the creation of a budget entry sufficient to support LIFE funding for nature protection and biodiversity which we do not feel will be adequately protected or financed under the Commission &apos;s present plans .
the next reform of our institutions must not ignore that .
written statements ( Rule 149 )
since this debate opened , we have scored points by tabling proposals for amendments that substantially improve the original draft .
come on , prime ministers !
( CS ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , China obtained some enormous advantages when it joined the WTO in 2001 .
we should continue along the present path of reinforcing the multifunctional aspects of our agricultural policy .
nonetheless , the immense wealth in terms of the linguistic and cultural diversity of Europe is , at the same time , the cause of the greatest structural problem on the audiovisual markets in Europe .
these three form the core .
I am mobile enough to take the stairs down from the sixth or seventh floor .
Madam President , I can concur directly with the remarks made by Mr Imbeni and I shall also try to respond to his comments .
I know the budget has limited room for manoeuvre , but I think that , on such serious issues , which directly affect our citizens , the Union needs to make its priorities clear and find suitable solutions .
the next summit has to approve a financial perspective that will enable the institutions to function normally .
so , we say yes to reforms .
a shortcoming , however , in the measures being taken is the absence of a provision to deal with the problems of unemployment and deteriorating competition among Community seafarers .
I also welcome the very clear message in the report calling for a significant increase in research and science because that is one of the priorities we need to have .
the Union only has significance for the citizens by means of the implementation of its policies .
( RO ) Mr President , the free trade agreement with India will become the most substantial agreement of this kind if the negotiations are concluded satisfactorily for both sides .
thank you very much , Mrs De Palacio .
I hope Parliament will fully endorse what is proposed here .
for example , I should like to discuss rationalising and streamlining any form of red tape that places a burden on small and medium-sized enterprises . Or we could even give such enterprises access to a powerful network for market research and for passing on the information gleaned from these markets .
this is an oral amendment .
the economic crisis tested our faithfulness to the idea of integration to the full , adding an even more urgent significance to the Czech Presidency &apos;s motto .
the agreement consists of three basic components : an agreed schedule of tariff reductions for most-favoured nation ( MFN ) banana exporters ; agreement on how to deal with &apos; tropical products &apos; and products subject to &apos; preference erosion &apos; in the wider WTO negotiations ; a financial package , amounting to EUR 190 million , of assistance to ACP banana exporters , to be known as the Banana Accompanying Measures ( BAM ) programme .
the two best examples to date are the task forces that have been in place for some time now for Haiti and the Great Lakes region .
the debate is closed .
this report is currently being drawn up jointly by experts from all Member States and the European Women &apos;s Lobby , and will also be financed by the DAPHNE programme .
thirdly , we have no interest in abandoning Turkey to the Islamic fundamentalists , for we are opposed to all religious or other forms of fundamentalism on principle .
we have made a firm commitment to training human resources , providing infrastructures and expanding communication technologies .
estimates indicate that between 35 000 and 50 000 employees could benefit from this support each year .
Mr President , I wish to say that the debate is important , but I feel there is a certain lassitude and perplexity about it , especially from the answers given by the President-in-Office , whose intentions are clearly good .
the debate is closed .
as well as criminalising the offenders , as described in Mrs Angelilli &apos;s report , we must also raise awareness among people who look after children and explain the risks involved in Internet use .
it is the United Nations , therefore , which is assuming responsibility just as it assumed this responsibility for the Israeli State , which proved to be fair for some and unfair for others .
we have a responsibility to create legal instruments which can deal with this international crime affecting individuals in their everyday lives , often very tragically .
Madam President , Parliament must deplore in no uncertain terms President Bush &apos;s military order permitting the secret trial of prisoners in Guantanamo Bay by a military commission , which may adopt its own rules of evidence , judge and pass sentence .
- After the vote on paragraph 66
that is to say , there are many quarters where religious values are not respected .
I think that is the first matter to deal with . At present only some of the languages are available .
allow me as well to ask you to make sure that this gets done in the best possible way .
and now , Ladies and Gentlemen , I have some good news for you .
processing is indeed involved and there is also a supra-regional aspect to this , which recently emerged in the debate in committee on added vitamins , and which needs to be examined in much more detail within the Commission .
as we are always saying , commercial , migration and security policies must be consistent with development goals .
the new provision would allow such behaviour to continue and put it on a legal footing .
in its communication on corruption control , the Commission covered a wide range of issues , but failed to mention corruption within its own organisation .
it has rejected the two amendments and adopted the rest .
things have developed very differently from what we expected just over a year ago .
Madam Commissioner , we shall never understand why the Commission did not adopt the simple formula of distinguishing between the generic designation of a product and the specific designation of particular products derived from the basic product . I doubt that you are interested , Madam Commissioner , but in my view that was the only rational solution .
we both need to promote the message that clean , efficient technologies and &apos; green jobs &apos; can play a role in economic recovery .
I am an MEP from a new Member State , and when we discussed the annual report of the Ombudsman last year , I had no personal experience with the Committee on Petitions or with the institution of the Ombudsman .
because if we are not careful we shall soon find ourselves with no accused and no finances before the tribunal .
( FI ) Mr President , we all know that Mr Wojciechowski , as Chairman of the Committee , is only the formal author of the question .
secondly , there was no red light after two minutes were up .
day in day out you decide to save banks ; meanwhile , the Irish are sinking .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , dear guests from Thuringia in the visitors &apos; gallery ,
three of the 31 negotiation packages have been concluded provisionally , and four more are about to be concluded .
the Council and Parliament must consult with each other in order to find a solution to this conflict .
perhaps this is because it cannot be objected to on legal or economic grounds .
please use the proposed reform to facilitate the concentration of supply in the face of distribution monopolies , the operators who dominate the market and who set their own prices and conditions .
. – Mr President , the situation in North Korea , if one thinks about it at all , appears depressing and hopeless , but I find myself having , time and time again , to think back 25 years to the days when I was a young assistant in this House and was fortunate enough to have had a hand in the first resolution – which was in support of Charter 77 .
many colleagues felt that there should be a specific extension of this to satellite and conditional access systems .
our ties are therefore based on a partnership instead of on aid and a relationship of dependency as before .
the political groups constitute a practical arrangement for giving MEPs the opportunity to work in conjunction with more or less like-minded people .
however , the boundaries on research in these fields must be marked out if we are to avoid ethical , social and legal problems .
we are calling on Iran to resume cooperation with the IAEA before the issue is discussed in the Security Council .
I welcome and support this report on Europe &apos;s wilderness areas .
with regard to long-term non-thermal effects , however , it is considered on the basis of opinions from certain international bodies that there is insufficient evidence to lay down limits for such exposure .
history and the direction of history are unequivocal .
as your colleague , Mr Barnier , said - and this is written in black and white - you lack the legal and moral basis to reform the Structural Funds now .
I do not really think that limiting the candidates to &apos; five plus one &apos; is a courageous approach to the problem of reforming the institutions , which was evaded at the Amsterdam Summit .
data supplied by Eurobarometer and gathered by Coldiretti in Italy show that in a food emergency , 43 % of Italians , for example , avoid the foods they have heard about for a certain length of time , whereas 13 % cut them out of their diet for good .
the Pact has been called ‘ stupid ’ .
I will put off any solution for ever and a day .
as the questioner pointed out , it is however also extremely important that this question not only be discussed within the European Union but also at international level and in conjunction with work being done by the United Nations .
we also emphasize in our report that public access to documents is not worth much if not everyone can find out which documents exist and then request some of them .
for these reasons , I have voted against the report .
it must also be mentioned that the court of law in the Danish bottle case announced that a return-of-deposit system was a fully acceptable system for recycled packaging , and it is also a possible solution , of course , for non-recycled packaging - as is the case in Sweden .
if we do not follow the WTO &apos;s ruling we will be exposed to costly counter-measures .
eventually , legislation will have to be modified at international level , at the level of United Nations maritime law , so that the rights of coastal states and coastal populations are better safeguarded and taken into account in a more balanced fashion .
the trade movement asked for a &apos; Social Europe &apos; , and the Council , the Commission and Parliament created the impression that this social Europe was on its way .
we must , therefore , respond vigorously to those who are responsible for these appalling acts , which are genuine acts of war against the free world ; not only to those who were directly involved in carrying out the acts but also to those who have given shelter to , protected , funded or encouraged these people .
Mr de Villepin and Mrs Merkel , like many others , are quite right when they say that in that case , Turkey does not belong , and so I hope that that is the message that this House will be sending out .
although he does recognise the benefits of such agreements in principle , the rapporteur does not forego a differentiated approach and , on several occasions , calls for a constructive dialogue between the Commission and Parliament .
I am just troubled by the fact that the committee did not accept an amendment I tabled to set a limit - the total amount - on the loan to be registered .
I congratulate the rapporteur on the work she has done and hope that the Commission and the Member States will commit themselves more to solving the countless problems that people affected by this disease have to face – taking account of this report and the work done by organisations representing multiple sclerosis sufferers – in their fight for equality of access to treatment and services and in defence of their dignity .
we must also try to negotiate with our neighbouring states in order to adopt the same policies so that we would have a one-sea , one-policy system , which undoubtedly would be beneficial to all .
I therefore support Parliament &apos;s maintaining of the initial funding allocated to these areas .
we are , however , determined to continue that work and to present a full account of its results as soon as possible .
thirdly , Parliament envisages that the retrofitting of all existing rolling stock should be eligible for state aid .
but just as we declined yesterday to talk again about Turkey , so we shall not always be able to give our approval to this resolution . Because , if you demand in recital G an open and continuous dialogue with China about this question , then it makes no sense to pass a resolution against China at every sitting of this House .
what is more , like all medical procedures , it is never without risk .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Florence European Council will be the culmination of the Italian presidency &apos;s term and the government of my country is approaching this important appointment in full awareness of the responsibility facing us , but also of the significance and value of the work that has been done since last January .
the training of seafarers - including the issue of a common language , Commissioner - is essential for improving maritime transport safety and preventing accidents .
we will have to take a closer look at the implications .
I welcome the report by my Dutch colleague in the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) , Mrs Oomen-Ruijten .
furthermore , I believe that transparency is a good thing , not only in terms of the control which this House has to carry out , but it is also good in itself .
in this instance , recourse to the precautionary principle should be linked to empirical data and should lead to the implementation of a monitoring system .
directive 94 / 45 has long since lost currency and it is not harmonised with other EU directives , especially Directive 2001 / 86 supplementing the Statute for a European company with regard to the involvement of employees and Directive 2002 / 14 establishing a general framework for informing and consulting employees in the European Community .
my question is , how do we consider things ?
what is clear is that the military headline goal agreed at the Helsinki European Council will require a concerted and coordinated effort by all Member States .
we expect and we hope , Mr Hatzidakis , that these points will also be quickly finalised .
the rapporteur said that the original text was in German .
however , here too real investment is needed in the economy , together with more control .
he has done an excellent job .
they do not see the government . They see Shell .
in our view , your approach and that of the right-wing majority in the Council pose the biggest threat to the very future of the European idea because they are destroying the notion of belonging to a community , the notions of solidarity and cohesion .
I would like to say that the remedy for the current crisis certainly is not greater regulation , nor is it higher taxes or more intervention .
Asia - this is my greatest recent understatement - is an extremely large region and therefore we are not advocating a &apos; one-size-fits-all policy &apos; .
in so far as international rules allow , they reserve the right to do so themselves .
thank you very much , Commissioner , for the answers you have given to all these questions .
my thanks go to all of you too , beginning with Mr Borrell , who closely followed all the stages of the procedure , and in addition , of course , to all my fellow Members , who made their own contributions via ideas and proposals , and who I hope today will also use their vote to contribute to a positive outcome , honouring me with their trust .
there have definitely been failures in the integration processes .
the indicative fund level , as just mentioned , is no higher than of 0.5 % of the Community budget , expressed as an annual average .
this is my last speech in this plenary session .
Mr President-in-Office , I assume that you missed some of what was said because Mr Cohn-Bendit was talking to you .
the main aims of the proposal – to improve road safety and reduce environmental pollution – are worthy ones , but there is not sufficient evidence that this is the best way to achieve them .
we feel , however , that the need to have the ability to intervene in order to prevent disruptions on the currency markets has been underestimated . It has been underestimated firstly in respect of the economic risk presented by monetary disruptions associated with the fluctuation of considerable flows of private capital ; we should recall that the loss of wealth through the devaluation of shares that followed the crisis that began in Asia a little over a year ago is estimated at between $ 1 600 billion and $ 3 500 billion .
Georgia deserves to receive our support .
initially , however , it did not adopt a particularly interventionist line . One section of the administration used the trauma of 11 September to impose its own unilateralist and extremely interventionist agenda which predated those terrible events .
it would be much more efficient if monitoring were also carried out on the basis of prices - and this a priori , or at the time licences are issued .
the report questions whether the present system ensures the effective supervision of large groups that operate in various countries and sectors .
that means savings as regards contractual obligations and savings in areas such as conferences , mission costs , meetings and information technology .
but , turning to the report , I think our role should not be to regard technology with suspicion , but if necessary to establish rules guaranteeing universal access to new opportunities , rejecting public monopolies and exclusive positions .
have you stopped to ask what kind of effect the debate we are having here and the statement delivered by the Council Presidency last weekend are having in Austria itself ?
I am arguing today not for more rights for terror suspects but only for them to be able to rely on their rights like anyone else .
they want to demonstrate the fact that they have been fighting for a long time for their rights and for the developments that have taken place in their respective countries : the right to move and work , and to educate their children .
to that effect , I will gather consumer and business stakeholders together at a joint meeting in June 2009 to clarify elements of the proposal and to further discuss the most important aspects of the proposal .
it is a question of the utmost interest to all of us and all of our citizens .
let me just mention two projects that have been successful .
does the President-in-Office of the Council believe that the figures included in the financial perspectives are sufficient to resolve these problems facing the southern flank of the Mediterranean ?
there are major discrepancies in fireworks legislation in European countries .
food prices in Europe ( short presentation )
secondly , Article 137 of the Amsterdam Treaty lays down that the number of Members of the European Parliament must not exceed 700 , but at the next elections 626 MEPs will be elected for a 5-year term of office .
creating a single internal energy market is referred to as a political priority in the agreement and long-term strategy of the troika of Spain , Belgium and Hungary .
thank you for your attention .
the Commission is very pleased with the outcome of the negotiations and can accept the proposed compromise amendments in full .
consumers will be able to make their purchasing choices in full knowledge of the rules relating to their desired product .
Mr President , Commissioner , honourable Members , we now turn from such fundamentally demanding issues as energy and climate change to discuss another very important matter that has , in the past , demanded your attention here in the European Parliament , and also that of the European Union as a whole not merely on one occasion but repeatedly , and the issue to which I refer is that of the sharing of airline passengers &apos; personal data .
we must put safety first and ensure that as much as possible is done to protect our citizens whilst travelling abroad .
current estimates show that bushmeat is being consumed on a massive scale across the humid tropics , particularly in Africa .
in regard to Mr Rübig &apos;s question , let me point out that today we are indeed benefiting from high world prices , which is an opportunity for European exports .
( Applause from the right )
this notion of the small establishment will ensure the survival of the small abattoirs spread evenly across the territory .
. – The European Union and the international community are preparing to write off some of Iraq ’ s debts and , at this moment , the debts of the countries ravaged by the tsunami .
this does not in any way affect the individual Member States &apos; procedures , nor is it a measure which tries to be ambitious and look again at the whole issue of asylum procedures as such , or indeed asylum criteria .
immediately after arriving in Chile &apos;s capital Santiago , Commissioner Georgieva travelled to the area most affected by the earthquake and tsunami , including the coastal region around Constitución , Talca , and Concepción .
in other words , Council and Parliament decisions are subsequently interpreted by the Commission , where possible , in the way which the various interest groups perhaps want them interpreted .
if you compare that with the number of trees that you have , which make up only 20 % of the overall total , and with the surface in hectares , which amounts to only 18.8 % of that in the EU , there would actually be justification for transferring part of your guaranteed amount to Spain , rather than in the direction in which you have called for it to go .
this means that Iraq should give full unrestricted access to UNMOVIC inspectors to any site , area , equipment and installation at any moment without any conditions .
firstly , the frequency of controls should be increased , both within the EU and in third countries . Transport problems usually occur not because of faults in the legislation , but in its execution .
let me say , in the presence of the Vice-President of the Commission , that I very much regret – and this is not a criticism of the Dutch Presidency , but of the Council ’ s General Secretariat – that the Council is not present on this important day .
5 . Draft Amending budget No 2 / 2007 ( vote )
it should be a tool at the service of genuine economic and social cohesion .
in any case , despite Mr Pirker &apos; s laudable efforts , this report is ambiguous in the way it is worded in general , because it does not dare to say clearly that the Commission &apos; s approach , in its communication on immigration , is wrong .
this security of energy supply depends upon investments that are already clearly inadequate .
thousands of jobs have been lost .
the next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance .
the reference to comitology was inserted at the request of those MEPs who support delegation by Member States .
apart from this , agreements of key importance have been reached with regard to the common agricultural policy and cohesion policy as well .
in the case of excessive distances , for example , the environmental burden outweighs the benefit .
however , it also became obvious , and the debate on Afghanistan is an example of this , that there is a high level of civil and military cooperation in an area where the European Union can make a significant contribution .
we need exploration of knowledge , we have to expand , and therefore it is of critical importance for Europe that patents , whether with enhanced cooperation or with the common European directive , get off the ground .
I would add , moreover , that the presence of the Convention is a breath of fresh air amongst the closed doors of secretive diplomacy .
without talking clearly about that perspective - and I am talking to all friends from every part of Europe - we are , in fact , going to be working together to maintain badly functioning democratic systems in the East .
therefore , my appeal can be summarised by saying that , today , the great educational challenges must be pursued very conscientiously and quickly .
I voted for this report .
that is what our fellow citizens expect .
naturally , I will inform the President and the necessary steps will be taken , you have my word .
this is what I would like to see , rather than the method of &apos; shut your eyes and advance &apos; .
experience of the ad hoc procedure has been reasonably good to date .
any upsurge in the flow of illegal migrants must be decisively countered .
please let us avoid a repeat of Rwanda .
the problem for a European Public Prosecutor is simply what is the legal basis for such a prosecution .
in future , we will certainly have to examine carefully whether the registration procedure will ensure a sufficient degree of safety .
the connection between immigration and employment is to be discussed at a joint OECD / European Commission conference in January 2003 .
I am sure his experience will help there in the future , because the Lisbon agenda is all about delivering growth and jobs for Europe , and the Minister knows about delivering those two things .
I would like to thank the draftsperson , Mrs Sauquillo , the Commission , the Council and all those who will accept my compromise amendments and thus allow the report to be adopted today , just in time to ensure that the regulation enters into force on 1 January next year .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12.15 p.m.
first the Council : the Council adapted its Rules of Procedure to the regulation on 29 November and published them on 3 December - just in time , in other words .
European citizens do not believe today that the Shanghai agreement was the most correct framework ; or they probably believe that it was very late coming .
the directive provides that , in future , citizens will be able to choose in which Member State to receive planned medical services .
from the point of view of European SMUs , it is particularly important that European third-party certifiers should continue to be able to place their own marks on all products .
this was unmistakably the basis for further persuasive action and tying up loose ends in the negotiations over the last few weeks .
this demonstrates yet again how the House views these recommendations .
secondly , this report appeals very clearly to Europe &apos;s own responsibility in matters of securing peace and of reconstruction in this war region .
in my report , I have outlined three points , and today , I should like to do this again .
these biological resources are too often used without the consent , or indeed against the wishes , of the indigenous peoples or local communities in whose country they are found ; we might even say they are being stolen .
however , Community law allows the application of national safeguards with regard to media pluralism .
turning to the content of your report , let me begin with the role of the producer organisations .
are there any comments ?
the authorisation of a harmful substance must , in my view , be an essential stage in the regulation .
we will therefore vote against the text which has been proposed .
we did .
she is undoubtedly an excellent MEP whose work is very good , but ultimately , she has aligned herself with the Council &apos;s view .
as far as we would be hesitant about insisting on reciprocity and meeting commitments , it would be unrealistic to hope that EU support for Russia &apos;s membership will make Mr Putin &apos;s state behave according to the WTO rules .
this is quite significant for the new Member States , since their contribution to aiding developing countries is gradually increasing .
I said this morning that enlargement is the future of the Union .
in all essential respects the resale right is a national matter and that is what it should remain .
we are looking for the Lisbon Treaty to be approved in Ireland .
the Commission does not believe that the problems arising in Europe relate to an expansive fiscal policy .
to take three questions together and only get through ten questions is really a reflection on this House .
Mr Gollnisch , I am a very nice and patient man .
the March or June summit should give a mandate to its president , in close cooperation with the Commission , to submit an ambitious plan for the strengthening of economic governance in the EU for decision by the December 2010 Council .
Mr President , I want first of all to thank the chairman of the committee , who is also the rapporteur for this matter , for the work he has done .
secondly , the minimum period of use .
the introduction of technologies that block access can be one way of doing this , besides making families and children aware of the dangers .
subject : Measures to reduce alcohol consumption
seeing the enthusiasm that greeted the euro on 1 January , welcoming this new currency for 300 million people in the European Union , we have to recall , on the one hand , how difficult was the road to this .
observance of these principles should help to protect relief workers and give them access to victims in cases of conflict .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to come back to the issue of the European Union &apos; s signing of the additional Palermo protocol , entitled the &apos; Protocol to Prevent , Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons , Especially Women and Children &apos; .
the amendment is still on the agenda , since it was re-tabled .
at the same time , the Pakistani Taliban has become a real threat to peace and stability in the country .
while the Member States must specifically retain their competences regarding the security of their external borders and the establishment of domestic immigration quotas , it is equally necessary and urgent to set up effective transnational cooperation to create a common on visas , border control and repatriation , as the rapporteur has underlined .
the second is that the International Labour Organisation ( ILO ) uses the data provided by these organisations to saturation point and the third and final issue is to remind the House that discharge for all four organisations was approved just yesterday .
it is true that the activities of the Council bodies will result in changes to the tenor of some provisions of the proposals or initiatives being submitted to them .
furthermore , the cross-border radioactive contamination of the river Nestos is an indisputable fact .
it should also be possible to reach a compromise this year , and our argument should be the strength of Thursday &apos;s vote in the European Parliament .
I will therefore ask you again : when Mr Oettinger says &apos; We suspect that some of the plants currently connected to the network will not survive the stress tests &apos; , I interpret this to mean that you are aware that safety at these plants is so poor that they will not meet the criteria .
these are atrocious as a result of Russian bombardments .
we all talk about the impending crises over water shortages .
before undertaking such activities , it is vital to carry out a very careful analysis of their potential influence on the natural environment .
the European Parliament does not represent the people ; it represents the interests of capital .
we must make vigorous joint efforts to this end .
Mr President , there is something missing from this text that I must point out since it deals with a framework programme for culture .
it is on the roads that most accidents happen .
in 1996 , I demonstrated against Milošević in Belgrade together with the members of the current government , and I could wish for nothing better than for this government to be the one to bring Serbia into the European Union .
the Commission &apos;s non-existent policy on non-existent Structural Funds does little to promote a feeling of belonging on the part of the European Union &apos;s citizens .
I was therefore pleased with Mrs Trautmann &apos;s initiative in this matter , and I support it .
I am happy to go along with Commissioner Malmström &apos;s proposals on this - her proposals are very broad - and I invite the Commission to follow Parliament &apos;s lead , rather than the lead set by certain representatives of the Council .
in the case in question , the flow of information to Parliament has been slow and fragmentary , at least in previous years .
we think it appropriate to place the main emphasis on the social aspects which necessarily underlie the subject under discussion .
a few months ago , we had a entire debate because the President of the Commission , Mr Prodi , said that European history dates from the time of Charlemagne .
one might venture to say that the means are overshadowing the ends .
it is thus a delicate matter to find a balance , and I shall not claim to settle these very difficult matters in a few minutes .
however , if this is what the budgetary authority wishes to do , the Commission can accept to treat about 250 million euros as &apos; provisional appropriations &apos; and place them in the reserve chapter B0-40 .
attempts - and now it is a question of more than mere attempts - to compare Zionism with racism , as at the Durban Conference and , therefore , to transform the Israeli-Arab conflict into a racial and religious conflict , when in fact it is a political conflict requiring a political solution , will certainly not have helped matters .
at this point I would particularly like to congratulate Commissioner Liikanen for the innovative measures that he has brought forward and the way that he is striving to bring Europe into the 21st century .
that study gave us a strong indication that criminalising the demand for trafficking has a very strong impact and that it substantially lowers the number of girls and young women being trafficked .
and on the subject of human rights , I would like in particular to ask you to help us defend them in Bolivia .
I would like to finish off by saying something about labelling and tracing of loading units containing dangerous goods .
I sincerely hope that , as a result of those comments , the overall report will receive widespread positive support across and within political groups , because making patient needs a priority should surely be above party politics .
thus , he ranks among the architects of the Stability and Growth Pact , and he has spoken out consistently and clearly against watering it down .
we cannot have a situation in which some countries , like my country , Germany , bear a far heavier burden than others .
in relation to the issue of a safe country of origin I do not think there is such a thing as a safe country anywhere .
I believe that we can make progress , resolve some issues and get some important processes off the ground relating to those matters that we have in common and need to resolve in a close and strategic partnership with the American administration .
so we have efficiency , renewables and gas , and then you want to invest EUR 1.3 billion in carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) .
please promote the whole agenda , so that we do not have to end up regretting unfulfilled decisions , as happened in Laeken with certain decisions taken in Tampere .
I am struck by the degree of consensus there usually is on this important subject right across the parliamentary groups .
this was designed firstly to ensure that this body took advantage of the experience gained in other institutions in the administrative and financial fields through the transfer of know-how ; secondly to enable it immediately to take its place as an institution by exercising its functions and prerogatives ; and , finally , to ensure compliance with the golden rule of good financial management through the introduction of economies of scale .
although we made faster progress with integration during the 1990s by following a federal approach , the voice of the nations seems to be making itself heard again since the drafting of the Treaty of Nice .
in this sense , therefore , the category of young people is particularly concerned , and the text we have adopted today must be addressed first and foremost to them .
we do not need imposed redistribution ; what we need is partnership and cooperation .
I also welcome the President-in-Office ’ s stated intention to consult on the Constitution , but we need to consult not only each other in the institutions but also the public and take note of what they say .
the Commission has always maintained that decisions in the field of immigration have to be compulsory and there must be some guarantee of controls by European Parliament .
I do not think it is a good idea for the Fourteen to try to take decisions together , leaving the United Kingdom in an isolated position on all the issues in question .
in home affairs policy they perhaps concern a legal culture , national traditions , and different notions of social values .
I would also condemn all violence against women .
that takes me to the fourth point . The money that will now flow from Brussels and from the national treasuries into the large-scale rationalised holdings will be used by them for further rationalisation and growth .
so it is an extremely balanced report , too , as regards it terms of reference .
( FR ) Mr President , Mrs Ashton , the events on Ashura Day and the bloody repression of the recent demonstrations in Iran have shown that it was a total mistake to make a very artificial distinction between the hardening of the regime internally and the inflexible policy that it pursues externally , in particular , on the Iranian nuclear issue .
we feel , however , that it fails to condemn the EU ’ s repressive , securitarian policy , which criminalises illegal immigration , whereby measures are taken to seal off borders , to set up detention centres and to expel immigrants .
( PL ) Mr President , I would like to express the hope that the Knowledge and Innovation Communities that make up the European Institute of Technology will be spread evenly across the European Union .
our group has serious doubts , however , as regards the proposal to introduce a tax on currency speculation .
Madam President , the Tillich report is bone dry , I agree , but frankly its importance is such that there is no excuse for this debating chamber to be virtually deserted .
I hope that the initiative from the European Parliament to issue a declaration strongly condemning all the warring parties in the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo and to distribute it more widely , including to the UN Secretary-General , will bring about an improvement in the situation of the civil population , who are the real victims of this senseless war .
within five days , a decision is made , and a plan drawn up , specifying the duration , geographical location , the mission to be undertaken , the composition , number and profile of experts that each Member State is to supply to the team .
I will return to this in a moment , but on behalf of my staff , I would very quickly like to thank those Members of this House who have carried out the Commission &apos; s work .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , war is always cruel , and civil war even more so .
you are creating a bureaucratic monster : a laborious and lengthy authorisation procedure for every single advertising slogan from 25 Member States , obviously to be submitted translated word for word into all 20 official languages !
Baroness Ashton , in the current state in which Bosnia finds itself , stability and stabilisation are actually dangerous .
I wish to begin by thanking Mrs Schierhuber and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for all their work on this report .
in this context , I believe that the fundamental principles of coordinated development and urban-rural partnership are especially important and must be strictly observed .
the European Union wishes to see Tunisia maintain and develop its security and its prosperity .
we simply want the overall social importance of sport to be recognised by the Commission and in European law , perhaps giving it its own budget heading so that it does not just have to be promoted through pilot projects .
the Neighbourhood Policy has been developed , and we have seen how , in many of our partnership countries , democratisation has progressed and , in certain others , unfortunately taken a step backwards .
the inadequacy of the means harnessed by the countries of the EU as a whole is not desirable either for Europe or for our allies in NATO .
in the case of the cross-border region of Spain and Morocco , it is incumbent upon both the Spanish and Moroccan authorities , in partnership with the Commission , to identify common priorities for action for the period 2000-2006 .
these include the creation of a specific 2020 fund , the increase in state requirements concerning the environmental performance of goods , and the incentive to construct energy-efficient buildings .
we have tried to unfreeze all those which we find not to be incompatible with the Court decision .
those who know me know my unwavering commitment to this , today as Commissioner and previously in other capacities .
 
think about it in the Commission before you make any over-hasty decisions .
 
despite these shortcomings , however , we must pay tribute to what is , in many respects , the historic impact that this joint text will have on many countries and regions .
we know that on the eve of the WIPO informal meeting , we have one further chance to address this matter in September .
the right of workers to be consulted and involved is not just a matter of courtesy or form .
now , I have no choice but to repeat my question , because the new document does not say a word as to why this failure happened .
everyone has shown a lot of commitment and a desire to obtain an outcome that is good for dogs and cats .
your answer was interesting .
it is evident that , meanwhile , unilateral action from either side is to be discouraged , as this could well harm future negotiations .
because I have found that almost nothing has been taken into account by Mr Sindal &apos;s report .
Mr President , the report works on the basic assumption that the easily-accessible fresh water reserves have been largely opened up , that long-term water use and savings can be achieved by using economic leverage , and that this would promote the responsible use of water .
this funding comes within the framework of decisions by the European Council , which unanimously decided that &apos; the stability of Iraq is a shared interest &apos; , emphasising &apos; the Union &apos;s commitment to supporting the political as well as the economic reconstruction &apos; of the country .
( PL ) Mr President , the position of Parliament on the global division of obligations concerning CO2 reduction unfortunately lacks balance regarding the way the costs of this reduction are to be borne .
I would ask you to let us proceed with our agenda and stop listening to this nonsense .
the approach taken in the report seems to be undermining the efforts now undertaken by the government of Sri Lanka to promote truth and understanding , not least through the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission , and the government actually having released more than 200 000 detained Tamil prisoners .
 
I hope many local authorities will actually participate in these consultations .
 
as the rapporteur said , it is true that not all of the aspirations of the European Parliament contained in its previous report , drawn up by our friend and former colleague , Mr Georgios Anastasopoulos , have been taken into account .
personally , as a member of the Committee on Culture and Education , I submitted an amendment to the opinion drafted by CULT regarding this report .
I naturally attach great importance to this report and to the Commission report , because the ever-recurring conflicts between the United States of America and Europe can be attributed not least to the fact that we have particularly close economic ties with 70 countries throughout the world and that great mutual support exists .
nevertheless , recurrent problems arise in fields such as the protection of intellectual property — the fight against forgeries and counterfeits — the transparency of legislation , standardisation and certification , the openness of services , in particular financial services , telecommunications and transport , and numerous non-commercial obstacles , such as the CCC , the notorious China Compulsory Certification , which is almost impossible to obtain .
the European economic and social model must be defended , but it must never overstep the boundary into protectionism .
question No 3 by ( H-0444 / 01 ) :
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Oostlander &apos;s report is most welcome .
finally , all this is particularly important because the Treaty of Lisbon is to be ratified over the next few months .
Mr President , the new Irish vote , this time approving the Lisbon Treaty , is indeed very good news .
what can we do now ?
it is absolutely essential that Parliament , in partnership and cooperation with the Joint Parliamentary Assembly , should be able to exert its influence .
Mr President , I may be mistaken , but I was under the impression that to amend such allocations an absolute majority was needed .
it includes specific measures to secure external borders , as well as data protection .
I represent fisheries policy .
the EIB has seen its role expand in 2008 as a result of the financial crisis .
lastly , I think that a committee of wise men , which will not produce its proposals until May , will work for the next Commission but not for this one .
I can understand your being embarrassed , Mr Coûteaux .
in the short term , the governments of the countries concerned should adopt more resolute strategies of escape from the crisis .
many here have said that this is a new kind of collaboration .
this also applies to independent resellers , to those known as grey resellers .
we shall also continue to underpin the efforts of Member States to improve their energy efficiency , by exchanging information on the one hand , and by closely monitoring the performance of energy efficiency on the other .
I regret , Mr President and esteemed colleagues , that I must inform you that the situation with regard to minorities and human rights in the Mari Republic has not improved since that time .
there are no other criteria that should apply .
they take no notice of the rest of the world .
it is clear that we must underline and strengthen the national and indirect option and it is also obvious that this is the majority &apos; s preferred option .
if you will allow me a comment on the side , Mr President of the Council : If it is true that secret data from the Schengen computer has been sold to organized crime , as the Neue Zürcher Zeitung has reported , that would be an unprecedented scandal and would have to have consequences both in the security system and for the responsible individuals , and I believe that it would be altogether advisable if the President of the Council would look into it , even though the Union has not been responsible for Schengen up to now .
we are therefore awaiting the package with eagerness and interest in spring 2011 .
we unreservedly support the proposal to withdraw tariff preferences for Burma .
( the speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
within our institutions , we must give ourselves the means to prevent all forms of conflict , for they are also a source of tension .
I believe that all these objectives are contained in the measures included in these three reports .
I would like to encourage the ECB to do its utmost to ensure that all reforms to the pact are interpreted correctly and increase transparency and efficacy along with expediting the structural consolidation process .
we have a huge opportunity , and a huge prize is on offer .
in the budgetary situation in which several Member States find themselves at the present time and in view of chronic deficits in excess of the 3 % ceiling , these data assume even greater importance as a means of accurately measuring the extent of the problems with a view to taking appropriate remedial action .
to start with , it is very good that , after a long time , European labour legislation is now being laid down again .
I voted against the resolution on the lessons to be drawn for nuclear safety in Europe following the nuclear accident in Japan .
an extreme ecologist position , unreasonable in economic terms , has thus been avoided .
that notwithstanding , we have proved that we are capable of coping , shortly before the end of the parliamentary term , not only with enlargement , but also with giving a social policy reform greater depth .
the Commission has set out the guidelines for the pre-draft of the budget by highlighting the need to adopt a strict budget in order to alleviate the tasks expected of Member States preparing for EMU .
in the meantime , it also intends to convene a meeting of political and economic agencies operating in the Alps and the Pyrenees .
we have noted , for example , that technical cooperation is provided for in the area of the environment so that the most efficient flight routes can be used in future .
to this end , I recommend that anybody who is not convinced should read the latest essay by Susan George .
such innovations hold the greatest potential for limiting emissions , by even more than the target of 20 % .
so if there are specific sectors which guarantee adequacy , each Member State must highlight and state what measures it has taken in its reforms .
what Russia needs most of all is an open Europe , willing to plan a joint security structure instead of adopting senseless decisions , such as the expansion of NATO and the drawing of new frontiers by means of the Schengen agreements , which in reality have the effect of partitioning Europe and furthering confrontation .
we need all the ingredients to be able to revolutionise urban mobility and establish this new culture .
we are therefore talking about reactors which are constructionally unsafe and whose constructions cannot be upgraded , at least not at justifiable costs .
instead we must strengthen our effort to ease the burden on our companies .
however , as the panel of experts presided by Ambassador Amorim noted in April 1999 , the Iraqi population would not have suffered such privations had the measures taken in 1991 by the Security Council not had to have been extended .
in writing . - Madam President , in Russia today , we are seeing the harassment of civil society by the authorities .
so be it . But the 200 grammes that make up the difference will be seized upon by many private and therefore profitable bodies .
the opinion of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy .
I am , however , resolutely opposed to the calls for health warnings .
companies also have a social responsibility , which is something that Levi Strauss has totally forgotten in this case .
such industrial and international fishing threatens traditional coastal fishing in the Mediterranean .
although firms from outside Europe are also involved , we should very definitely be working through and analysing the list naming European firms and private individuals . This should be done in the individual Member States and with a view to criminal prosecution .
firstly , I feel that this Temporary Committee should not have been set up in the first place , given that the Council of Europe carried out an inquiry into the matter , under Article 52 of the European Convention on Human Rights .
first , why has the European Union sent almost one billion euro to Algeria since 1996 , when that country is implementing a blatantly anti-Semitic policy ?
there is more work to be done in developing the scoreboard .
the Bureau is looking at the technological aspect .
where we can – and I am specifically saying this on behalf of the Council , we will actually do this in the Council as well – where we can , we must support and strengthen each other in this , and also learn from each other .
the most important thing is to refute the Russian accusations of poor quality and meat smuggling without delay in order to prepare the ground for negotiations on the strategic partnership agreement due to expire at the end of the year .
however , in Annex 1 it states very clearly that ‘ the European Union will maintain its aid efforts at at least the same level as that of the ninth EDF ’ .
the measures being proposed to safeguard a humane approach to immigrants do not satisfy us .
measures taken separately by individual countries under pressure from the protests will only make the situation more problematic and will distort competition .
when the Intergovernmental Conference attacked the results of the Convention , abolished the Legislative Council , re-introduced laws made by the Council and added on the third part - and all these things that really upset us today - I had the idea of a First Amendment of the Constitution in a far and distant future .
it forces each Commissioner to reflect upon his or her visions and ideas .
also , driving time , which has a real effect on road safety , is regulated by a different act of law , Regulation ( EC ) No 561 / 2006 , which also applies to self-employed hauliers .
for my own part , I am convinced that the most important thing about this is that we need , in transport and energy , a new culture , so what do I mean by that ?
I give the floor to the President-in-Office to answer Questions Nos 10 , 11 and 12 together .
after all , these priorities are going to influence distribution of the future budget , so we should maintain the possibility of financing such areas as development of cultural infrastructure and protection of cultural heritage as part of the European Regional Development Fund .
basically , this is a measure designed to bring about what has been called the &apos; single European sky &apos; and the liberalisation of air transport and air navigation at EU level .
we condemn the use of war , and we condemn most especially inhuman attacks on defenceless civilians , women and children , attacks that nothing can justify .
so we have no results that can be monitored and accordingly no way of evaluating the programmes .
I welcome provision for fines in the case of falsified statistics , so as to penalise fraud relating to deficit and debt calculation , both inside and outside the euro area .
let me put it bluntly : every government has the duty of protecting its citizens from the violation of their human rights by others ; failure to do anything is a gross violation of human rights .
these and other processes that serve to improve the quality of the heart valve can of course be carried out on a commercial basis .
once again , the question of human rights and democratization was raised , but we observed some change in the tone of the reply we received .
you too have made many appeals today .
I support this report and the proposals contained therein .
this is our chance to put right this sorry process of delay .
I hope that the Summit can send out this message .
Madam President , what Parliament wants to achieve with its resolution on dementia is to involve the European Union more , including financially , in the fight against Alzheimer &apos;s disease and other dementia diseases .
it contains arrangements for the EU &apos; s military crisis management which enable consultation with , and participation of , European NATO members which are not members of the EU and other countries which are candidates for accession to the EU .
I doubt they will render the desired result before disproportionately hurting the people of Iran who , as a result , become more and more dependent on the hard-line government .
it was a warning both for the United States and for Europe .
( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the United Nations has set 10 December next as the deadline for determining the future status of Kosovo .
but maybe then it would not take so long .
we want more insistence on the importance of the greenbox and more attention to special and differential treatment .
we will see if the House will accept the technical amendment tabled by the honourable Member .
they have destroyed regulatory instruments for production , such as quotas and production rights , along with mechanisms for intervention and market regulation .
in reality , own resources mean a new European tax , which I do not want .
Mr Winkler , I was sorry to notice that you did not say a word on the subject of the implementation of the law , even though this subject concerns the Member States most of all .
what I wish for on behalf of my delegation but also as one of my country &apos; s MEPs is proper supervisory control over the Commission and confidence on the part of the citizens in both the Commission and the European Parliament .
it is important that the Commission shows how this is to be done .
Mr President , Vilvorde is a textbook case . This is indeed the end result of the ultra-liberal policy that a majority of EU governments support and that many of the Commission &apos;s services also pursue .
despite this , however , not all the objectives of the Helsinki Process have been fully achieved .
the motion for a resolution on Turkey draws attention to the situation on human rights .
thank you , Commissioner , for your update .
this is what such a distinction may result in .
what has it done to encourage the development of renewable energy sources such as solar energy ?
there should be a clear majority in the House for a change of responsibilities , not just a small margin , especially when , as at present , we have said two different things in two different amendments .
the European Union must not contribute to this , because , as you are well aware , in the last vote in the United Nations , the General Assembly condemned the embargo as illegal by an overwhelming majority , and therefore condemned the Helms-Burton Act .
I think , therefore , that we can use this experience and be bold enough to take this approach .
I consider the division of tasks to be sensible , decided in all good faith but on an experimental basis , and since I have the power , under the terms of Amsterdam , to redistribute these competencies , I believe I will be able to do so fairly easily .
the low level of qualifications implies a high risk of unemployment , but continuous training and learning may help both the person and the economy .
at a social level the increased polarization caused by the US labour model is driving large sections of the population to become marginalized and the society of the USA , slowly but surely , to become a third-world society .
I have set out our ideas for a carefully targeted Iran strategy in an alternative motion for a resolution , and on the grounds that I have described , I shall call for the Belder report to be rejected .
the &apos; no &apos; vote in the Irish referendum , like the &apos; no &apos; vote in the Danish referendum last September , is a warning .
the Commission is therefore asked , in its own assessment report , to explain the impact of the programme on the dissemination of literature in those languages .
( PT ) I shall begin by saying that I am an associate member of the Sociedade Portuguesa de Autores ( Portuguese Authors &apos; Society ) , the Portuguese collective rights management society ( CRM ) in this area .
the proposed 3 % increase in expenditure seems to me excessive .
Mr President , last year Mrs Maes , Mrs Carlotti and I were in Chad to look at the pipeline project and its impact on the local people and communities and on the environment .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( EL ) Mr President , I should like first of all to say that I have the special honour of also speaking on behalf of my honourable friend Mrs Rothe , who is absent this evening .
to support the recommendations it had made , the Council highlighted a number of points , including the idea that a well-considered initiative involves a risk , or a measure of failure , which must be seen mainly as an opportunity to learn .
it was a concern at the early stages of the text that a &apos; one size fits all &apos; framework designed for equities was being imposed on the bond markets .
however , in the desirable process of expanding its external action capabilities , the EU must not confine itself to the military dimension alone : it must undertake to develop , in parallel , civil crisis management mechanisms involving action by the police , civil administrators , the judiciary , civil protection officers and so on .
there must be opportunities for both men and women to combine work and parenthood .
we should take note of that in respect of our fisheries policy , ecology and human rights .
.
now , at a time when we are seeing the positive results of the European Union &apos;s strategy in the area of growth and employment , it is the right time to begin to pursue social goals .
the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy adopted some proposals that , if realised , would make it harder to practise ecologically justified coincineration .
when I see that we alone in the European Parliament are planning an increase of 0.07 % in comparison with the year 2000 , then this rigour is guaranteed and we can show our face .
the rate of GDP growth in the euro zone in 2003 fell once again , from 3.5 % in 2000 to 1.5 % in 2001 , 0.9 % in 2002 and 0.5 % in 2003 , which means that the European economy was close to stagnation .
let us say it one more time , the Commission &apos;s proposals are not acceptable as they stand .
on the other hand , recent developments , such as the ruling by the Constitutional Chamber , certainly cast a shadow on the seriousness of the Nicaraguan Government to live up to its commitments .
hence the need for this Presidency to pay particular attention also to the preparation of the next Millennium round .
I saw Slovenia and Croatia become independent states and experience war at the beginning of the 1990s .
so whom do we owe it to ?
the services sector long ago stopped absorbing surplus labour from industry and agriculture .
however , Mr Santer , we wish to tell you that those are yesterday &apos;s priorities , not the priorities that the people of Europe are expecting today .
I shall give a complete list of the Commission ’ s position on the amendments to Parliament ’ s Secretariat .
but the setting up of this Tribunal persuaded me that it is an extremely useful instrument for international peace and for preventing other large-scale crimes .
this morning we are debating the scale and extent of it .
let us remember , however , that there are not just gulfs between countries but gulfs too within states , and these are growing all the time . That is a real yardstick for measuring the success of our societies , including our very own .
the financial Regulation or the response to Parliament &apos;s demand that the legislative and budgetary procedures be updated are two clear examples of the fact that interinstitutional cooperation is still unsatisfactory .
now the means of transport have changed : Georgians are deported from Moscow in planes used for the transport of cargo .
however , there were certain questions that we had to raise .
no sign so far of a coordinated economic policy , of an end to fiscal and social dumping throughout Europe !
it would discredit the European Union if we turned a blind eye to some severe offences in some countries , while imposing sanctions on other countries for identical offences .
this is why the right of trade unions to represent the interests of these workers is so important .
that is an important element in the criteria for Maastricht and the arrival in 1999 of the Euro .
are we doing everything we can to combat climate change and encourage renewable energy sources ?
I believe that the candidate countries must be given a place , the best possible place in this convention .
in comparison terms , Mr President , Morocco has slowly become one of the least dictatorial of the Arab States .
obviously our group agrees with this .
a defined list of the required data , which should not be excessive ;
that is my personal request to you , to Parliament and to you , Mr President .
there is a clear way ahead .
I will conclude by extending a special word of thanks to Mrs Thors who has not only shed some light on the significance of the Södermann report , but through her work with the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens &apos; Rights has also given an example which is admittedly not always followed in this House .
why do you not insist that Germany too consult its electorate before making war on the voters in neighbouring countries ?
I believe that it is first and foremost those countries covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy that should have the possibility of taking part in this programme .
so it is dangerous to smoke a cigarette but to smoke a joint is evidently good for your health .
they also mandated the High Level Working Party on Social Protection to study the sustainability of social protection and , in particular , of pension systems , on the basis of a Commission communication .
I hope I can take this as a sign that the Commission will be strongly supported by Parliament in carrying out the plan itself .
the Commission is prepared to work together with the German or Portuguese authorities to assess all requests for support from European funds .
I want to express my appreciation to my colleagues in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for their cooperation over these 10 years .
although small in comparison with national public budgets , the European Social Fund has been helping the Member States weather the recent economic crisis .
sulphites should be limited , also because in many cases they are unnecessary , as we have seen in the debate on dried fruit , for example .
clearly , we should try to persuade people not to use illegal drugs in the first place .
there are currently stockpiles of 2 million unsold vehicles .
however , they must be credible and it must be feasible for these countries to fulfil them .
following the conciliation meeting in November , Parliament still deplores the Council &apos;s refusal to increase the financing of programmes under the grand heading of &apos; Competitiveness for Growth and Employment &apos; .
naturally , our group agrees with the activists who are currently staging a dramatic hunger strike , and we state our commitment to bringing the question of Tibet to the forefront , with political discussion and a more complete resolution .
the EU countries delivering aid should insist on monitoring to ensure that aid reaches the cyclone victims most in need .
in essence , however , the report aims to do two things . Firstly , to ensure that a new and improved human rights and democracy clause , based on a respect for international law and accepted EU conventions , is included in all new international agreements entered into by the EU .
neither should we underestimate the positive aspects of both decentralisation and of having European bodies spread across Europe .
I am also pleased that there has been no weakening of the principle of the five-stage &apos; hierarchy of waste &apos; : prevention and reduction of waste , re-use of waste , recycling of waste ( less than a third of waste is recycled today ) , other recovery operations and , finally , the safe and environmentally sound disposal of waste .
we believe that we have to try to ensure that these two peoples who have been brothers for five thousand years find a solution which allows them to live together , and therefore I believe that to make this type of accusation is not only unjustified , but also it makes absolutely no contribution to the necessary peace process in the Middle East .
that concludes the debate .
in this context , I am surprised by the lack of reaction from the Commission to measures currently being taken by many members of the EU which break prevailing principles , while Poland has been punished for taking similar measures .
this directive was a step back from the liberalisation that we have already undertaken in the United Kingdom .
we have gained very significant experience in this committee and the European Parliament has been really proactive in investigating a matter which concerns the whole of the European Union , so I think we can congratulate ourselves on the progress this represents .
this is the lesson which we must teach the young people of today : the events of the past and the progress of the present , without hiding the crimes and mistakes which had to be overcome and pointing out the sacrifices entailed in overcoming them .
it therefore falls to the European Union to point the finger and tell each Member State whether its national legislation conforms to the Community acquis .
I wish to stress that this is to go ahead on the assumption that the Edinburgh decisions are not affected and that demands are not made of existing Community financing initiatives .
I have a supplementary question .
they require long working periods without proper rest and they provide completely inadequate medical attention .
I understand what lies behind this recommendation , but would ask you to consider that precisely for the sake of the efficient and rapid implementation of projects article 118 of the Financial Regulation allows services to be tendered for according to these procedures .
it must give consideration to the protection of children &apos;s rights , and recognise the right of orphaned or abandoned children to have a family and to be protected .
the consultations in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs were very constructive , for which , thanks once again to all the parliamentary groups and to all the shadow rapporteurs .
today I would like to briefly summarise our main reflections .
moving beyond words , for us the challenge of the Madrid Summit and the initiative of a global strategic partnership consists of offering an option which is fundamentally different to that of the United States .
it will also be crucial for a good example to be set in public construction projects .
Mr President , first of all , I would like to address my thanks to our rapporteur and congratulate her on the significance and the high quality of her work .
I believe that we cannot stand before the Lisbon Treaty like a rabbit caught in headlights .
integration is a question of pure political will , which lies in our hands and the hands of our colleagues in the Member States .
the Commission too must demonstrate social responsibility and sound management .
if these criteria are not adhered to , then development does not stand a chance
what are our views about what should be done on the Union &apos;s list of economic objectives ?
in its amended form , REACH will target the most hazardous substances ; PBTs , VPs and VBs will be registered early .
all in all , I am therefore of the opinion that conciliation produced a satisfactory agreement and that we went much further than we deemed possible at second reading .
I hope that these directives , improved by Parliament during conciliation , are approved and come into effect as soon as possible .
yet Parliament persevered and built up this consensus which reopened the Treaties – a taboo subject for many years .
we must remember that these problems were exacerbated enormously during the dictatorship of Pinochet .
the Dutch Government is justifying this by stating that in so doing , the Council and Parliament become equal , for indeed , whoever suggests the lowest amount , then that amount is final .
we have to get used to the idea of emphasising regional solutions until an international treaty is drawn up that is legally binding for every player .
for us , this is an issue beyond debate .
the Group of the Party of European Socialists rejected them .
what happens if a non-EU country like Libya does not carry out its search and rescue duty at sea ?
secondly , your reaction to the special report of the Ombudsman which was approved ...
at the end of their working life , many pensioners paint or create works of art , and so I want to protect the pensioners who are also artists .
I followed their efforts from my position here in Parliament as soon as they took up their offices .
we have to look at how we can continue successfully the international campaign against terrorism on as broad a front as possible .
what is true , however , is that some Member States of the European Union are applying principles that are producing excellent results where job creation is concerned .
in any case , President Prodi , I would like to say in conclusion , on behalf of my group , that the report still fails to express awareness of a certain sense of responsibility and to acknowledge the errors made .
consumer choice is the basic principle of the market economy and , as politicians , we should not be instrumental in running a kind of nanny State .
again , paragraph 18 states that it is essential to preserve traditional family farms and support young farmers in less-favoured areas and the outermost regions .
and although my experience is of little scientific value , I must point out that I have been able to note how , in the United States , a product which in Spain costs me EUR 10 , costs me just EUR 1.5 .
the unity and firmness of the international community , as expressed in the unanimous adoption of Resolution 1441 , and the military build-up in the Gulf have been essential in obtaining the return of the inspectors .
sending spam and deliberately creating disorder and malfunctions must be made punishable .
Mr Schulz , I did hear your question .
the first reform will calm citizens &apos; fears of creeping sovereignty transfers and the second should encourage citizens to engage more obviously with the political choices that we face in Brussels and in Strasbourg .
I do think we need to talk more about sustainable production and sustainable consumption across all of our lines - food and , indeed , textiles .
 
however , opportunities for cheating remain , and we do not have any way of checking how these animals are treated in the recipient countries .
these two reports genuinely constitute an important contribution to the interinstitutional dialogue on Community action in this field .
it is estimated that from 500 000 to 2 million people , and the majority of these are women and children , become the victims of human trafficking every year , forced into prostitution , forced labour and slavery or bondage .
that is the finding of the recent BioInitiative report , and its conclusions are indisputable : the risks include forms of cancer , Alzheimer &apos;s disease and nervous problems caused by chronic or excessive exposure to electromagnetic waves .
now , however , importers are to bear a greater share of responsibility alongside manufacturers .
when will European troops or other contributions be sent in to make the invading Ethiopian troops withdraw from Somalia , as decided by the UN Security Council ?
the French built the power station across La Ranche estuary demonstrating the technology ; in the UK both the Mersey , on a small scale , and the Severn , on a massive scale , are suitable sites .
this means that forest management must be well-planned and sustainable in order to maximise a forest ’ s protective and social functions , which are no less important than its productive functions .
the next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Mr Parish , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on animal transport - B6-0496 / 2008 ) .
on the contrary it supports productivism and the devastation of local crop farming here and throughout the world .
this would allow us to reveal the ongoing fraud perpetuated on supermarket shelves by bottles bearing the wording &apos; extra virgin oil &apos; , which instead contain mixtures of rectified or refined oils .
the national railway companies &apos; actions in recent years have predominantly been characterised by the fact that they have continued to try to cordon off their markets , while at the same time coming to terms with the consistent and dramatic decline in their figures in the freight transport sector .
the next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the Millennium Development Goal 5 : maternal health .
if we end up imposing fines , then we will not have achieved our objective .
the systematic slaughter of herds is expensive and ruins farmers &apos; selective breeding programmes .
only by strengthening internal regional trade will many nations be able to face globalisation and WTO rules .
the divergences in competitiveness and the gap between the surplus and deficit countries of the euro area has widened in the past 10 years .
you are now proposing to institute further reform , without any prior environmental impact assessment .
work has begun with a view to improving the quality of data in close coordination with the Member States and with the World Health Organisation in order to provide the Member States with better training instruments .
we will leave it in the hands of the Quaestors to see what further action should be taken .
some countries in the European Union prefer not to mention this facility because it means an additional burden on their domestic budgets .
. I do not wish to intrude on what appears to be an interparliamentary debate now on the relative merits of Brussels and Strasbourg .
in an ingenious way , it is handing over these important infrastructures to private profit-oriented capital and indeed promoting a whole range of legal guarantees to ensure that the related capital and profits will be completely secured .
are there two ways of fixing the price for Europe ?
I must reject Amendments Nos 9 , 47 , 95 and 97 on a 50-nautical-mile economic zone for the outermost regions as they stand , because this is a matter of national law .
secondly and more seriously , we need to aim for more intensive promotion of Community wines .
( Applause from the right )
the aims of this legislative package , with these two directives on transfer and procurement that we are discussing here today , will ensure that it is not just a matter of competitiveness , but also of putting a stop to the wasting of taxpayers &apos; money on the production of defence equipment and of preventing corruption .
Mr President , I would like to repeat again , that we are also each other &apos;s partners .
while these discussions were going on in the Committee on Petitions and when the European Parliament agreed for the issue to be debated publicly , which is what is happening today , additional debates took place in the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy and the Committee on Foreign Affairs .
I therefore ask you what specifically is going to be done ...
they need to know what they can and cannot do .
this set of texts reflects the European Union &apos;s legitimate concern to redefine its relations with the Americas as a whole in the aftermath of the Cold War , and to provide a counter-balance to a powerful zone of economic and trade development centred on the Pacific .
other countries , including my own , are hardly using any renewable energy at all , they are not supporting investments in this area and have no government programmes – on the contrary , they are creating administrative obstacles .
I do not understand how it is possible for aid which is not linked to production , and which is subject to similar criteria of an essentially environmental nature - such as direct payments , agro-environmental measures or compensation payments for disadvantaged regions - to be subject to different bureaucratic treatment and controls , and not be included in a single , unified system .
both we and the media are here for the real debate . The Commissioners are entitled to expect us to discuss this important political issue before we regulate our own internal affairs .
of course support should be provided to those who are there legally , and humanitarian aid should be given to illegal immigrants , but the provision of unrestricted social benefits to families for which this becomes their permanent and sole source of income is a misunderstanding .
I have voted against all the amendments and , in the final vote , against this report since we are of the opinion that the EU is wrong to continue with and give more aid to olive groves than was indicated in the Commission ’ s original proposal .
overall , I think Parliament should be pleased with its efforts .
thirdly , we are helping to reduce bureaucracy .
finally , to Mrs de Brún , who has now left this House , I would say that if she wants to prevent an Irish Ferries-style race to the bottom in the services area , then she should , as an obligation , vote for the amendments that she will be offered here tomorrow , as a first step – not as the only step , but as a first step – to prevent what she fears .
it will prosecute the worst kind of crimes , such as genocide , mass slaughter , widespread rape and ethnic cleansing .
as Mr Rübig just said , there is not one single answer for a pipeline : it would be a mistake to just opt for one ; instead , we need to open up a variety of routes and options .
therefore the independence of meat inspectors would be compromised , as those paying their wages would then be the companies they are in charge of inspecting .
nevertheless , when it comes to funding projects in the field of sport and development , the European Union ’ s support for such initiatives could only be channelled through the existing programmes in the field of development cooperation .
what guarantees does the European legislation protecting the environment offer these communities ?
another area where the Commission is proposing criminal sanctions is the protection of intellectual property rights .
in my opinion , this should be a very important discussion in future for , there too , employee participation should form a part of the tradition and routine .
on 1 May 1995 , Brahim Bouaram was thrown into the Seine and drowned during a demonstration by the National Front .
it is essential that EU programmes be adopted within the framework of the Europe 2020 strategy in the field of lifelong learning and professional training for women , with the aim of increasing employment levels among women .
in accordance with existing procedures , the Community has 60 days as of the date of the announcement of the panel report to all members of the WTO to adopt a point of view .
the President-in-Office has answered my question about how undercutting can be prevented in Europe between EU Member States when they are selling arms to a third country , but perhaps the President-in-Office would like to consider the question of end use which has often created problems in the past in tracing the eventual recipient country .
with the accession of Romania , there are now four European Union countries that share a border with Ukraine and one that shares a border with Moldova , a state of affairs that can only enhance the European Neighbourhood Policy .
we have emphasised that , in order to avoid distorting championship competitions , we are naturally disposed to accept rules limiting transfers to particular fixed periods and , above all , we have stressed that efforts made to develop young talent must be encouraged , which means that we can accept a compensation mechanism designed to reflect the expense incurred by a club in the development of young players , provided that such a mechanism does not put young players in a position of undue dependence on their clubs .
the fact that 14 parties are banned from participating in the elections that are taking place is also cause for concern .
I agree with him in that regard too .
you go to the shop ; the salesperson looks at you as if you were some kind of serial killer and you try to say , &apos; Well , what do you think I am doing ?
I welcome the EU mission in Tunisia to evaluate the legal situation in the stage prior to elections and the observation mission for those elections : identical measures must be taken as soon as stability is achieved in Egypt .
as we all know how difficult it is to reach Strasbourg , we understand all too well when our French fellow MEPs have difficulties with this too .
in the face of the Palestinian , Arab or Middle Eastern citizens , who die every day , assassinated by their Saudi or fundamentalist right- or left-wing regimes , assassinated by the firm , historic alliance of Sheikhs and Middle Eastern rulers , who are allied with the great oil multinationals and with you , the more or less communist left ; in the face of the situation of the Kurds , which is not just a Turkish problem but also an Iraqi problem and the problem of others as well ; in the face of the everyday lives of the Saudi and Palestinian men and women , you are only concerned with them if Israel is involved , and it may have done them some serious damage .
I wish to thank the rapporteur for an excellent report .
it is - I repeat - a small technical amendment that I would like to read , if you agree : &quot; The European Council is asked to observe its undertakings and to propose a single candidate for the Presidency of the European Central Bank during its forthcoming Summit , on 2 May 1998 &apos; .
that is the case .
instead of harmonising downwards and creating a single retirement pension market , we should set up a system based on solidarity and equality at European level .
Thailand has said it is unwilling to grant that , but that is a problem that will not go away .
I endorsed this resolution .
however , in order to be fully successful , we need a legal basis to ensure the continuity of the work on improving the reception , the integration , or , where they wish it , the satisfactory return of the asylum seekers and refugees present in the European Union .
as time goes by , the continent is also experiencing an enlargement of what it means to be European .
amendments Nos 33 and 34 have been withdrawn by the Group of the European Liberal , Democratic and Reform Party , and I therefore hope that other Members will only wish to vote on the committee &apos;s amendments .
as Parliament knows , the Commission at my instigation adopted a provisional technical amendment of Annex 3 to Directive 90 / 220 / EEC , according to which labelling would be required for all products released .
Europe will work with the world community to fight the spread of weapons of mass destruction and to promote disarmament .
I hope to be able to report to the Committee on Fisheries on possible solutions in the near future .
people consider that mass culling for disease-control purposes should be performed in the most humane way possible .
what is necessary is a return to prophylactic vaccination .
the project has already attracted considerable attention from the media and from politicians throughout the Baltic region over the last few months .
Mr President , with regard to Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , and to Article 10 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union , I was informed that , on Christmas Day , a massive abuse of religious freedom took place in the Church of St. Synesios in the occupied town of Rizokarpaso .
seven years is too long to wait for that assurance .
I hope that Parliament will vote for it tomorrow and that the Committee on Budgets will follow suit , something the Committee on Development and Cooperation has not done so far .
perhaps the most obvious are those activities in the area of restoration of our architectural heritage , but culture is not one of the objectives of the structural funds , despite what it has been possible to do .
we know all the excuses .
the importance of this directive , together with the urgent need for its adoption , justify my use of the right to submit an explanation of vote in writing , despite the fact that I am not a member of the Committee on Economic Affairs and , consequently , this is not an issue with which I have been particularly closely involved .
it is unfortunate that the failure of many Czech politicians &apos; courage has prevented that ; hence also my vote against , in solidarity with Mr Ferber .
we are now very close to achieving that objective .
global warming currently poses two major problems to humankind : on the one hand , the need to cut greenhouse gas emissions dramatically and , on the other hand , the need to adapt to the effects of climate change .
and what about combined heat and power generation ?
I do think it is rather worrying , especially after talks with the Info-Point in my home town , that there are obviously different budget lines from which the Info-Points can draw funding and that not all of them are affected by the problems relating to the new budget regulations .
in its negotiations with China , it managed to ensure the establishment in Macau of an institutional legislative framework , which is of particular importance from a European perspective , for the particular way in which we see Asia and the Pacific and in terms of our relations with the great nation of China .
in particular I want to refer to two areas of policy : the stability pact , where the French were right to call for a delay .
Mr President , a cooperation agreement on fisheries has been concluded with Morocco .
we should like to maintain this equality .
by now creating a European Institute for Gender Equality , the EU and the Member States are signalling the high priority they are giving to this issue , as well as the political will to do more to overcome the prevailing lack of equality .
I will also be returning to the matters which Mr van Velzen has just mentioned .
I do not , therefore , understand why some people want to distinguish between displaced persons and refugees .
however , as one of the country &apos;s biggest donors , the European Union must take a firmer stance and do more to ensure that human rights are respected there .
 
part of this amount , EUR 6.5 million , will be payable by the participants : the three institutions - Parliament , the Commission and the Council - and the governments and parliaments of the Member States or the candidate countries .
I therefore propose that the Member States act now to establish closer European coordination to regulate migratory movements in the European Union .
the resettlement programme may help to make illegal immigration less attractive to refugees seeking to enter the European Union .
population growth should not , therefore , be used as an excuse for refusing essential aid and trade preferences .
lastly , the act of directing , promoting , supporting or belonging to a terrorist organisation must also be subject to a common standard .
they will not just become better informed by means of the projects sponsored by Odysseus , but will also learn how other Member States solve certain problems .
there is not much dividing us .
on transport , we wanted to start with large , fixed-point installations , whose emissions can be feasibly monitored .
thank you , Madam Commissioner , for your presence and your statement .
what are the opposing interests in this case and how can we find a suitable balance between them ?
on the web , the best rubs shoulders with the worst : on the one hand , there are tremendous opportunities to diffuse and receive valuable , targeted information , for better social cohesion ; on the other , it is an ideal forum for stereotypes , prejudices , derogatory views and even dangerous content , as was mentioned in the question .
given the severity of the situation , the proposal discussed in Mr Bösch &apos;s report should not , however , be totally thrown overboard . We should be using the leverage it gives us to persuade the Commission to come forward with further suggestions .
to accuse such a person of treason is , I believe , to say the least , unparliamentary language , and he should be ashamed of himself .
if I have to talk of disappointments , then I am disappointed at the Libyan Government which is doing nothing to help allay this serious suspicion .
in any event , I think that , at the moment , as there is no legal basis , all we can do is try to discover , through the various Member States participating in the IGC , whether or not there is a will to work towards funding for European political parties .
finally , the problem of illegal landings .
second , the way to eliminate tax fraud is not through a reduction in competition but by the strict elimination of tax exemptions .
your remarks on the nuclear front , Baroness Ashton , were very clear and also very forthright : Iran continues to produce enriched uranium despite warnings from the international community .
as the House is all too well aware , Europe &apos;s external relations budget is already heavily committed .
there will be no first-mover advantage in financial regulation .
the proposal put forward by Parliament on the use of fuel in private cars is , in my opinion , unrealistically tough .
confidence , however , is not something that we can lay down in legislation .
in fact , the Commission tightened up the regulations as a result of the unfortunate accident which occurred in 2000 .
however , it is not the role of a Member to make the public aware of the problems that might affect people &apos;s safety or that of their families .
you and I come from the same country , and we know that experiments led to a 30 per cent reduction in the quantity of material in consumer packaging over approximately three years .
zero emissions is not a realistic aim .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it goes without saying that precise assessment of risks when giving credit is of crucial importance to the stability of the banking system , and so , whilst supporting the Basel II agreement &apos;s objective of strengthening the banks &apos; hand in evaluating risks , we nevertheless have a number of critical observations to make .
the only time that his wife has been able to see him was for a few minutes a few days ago , and she has been unable to see him again since . &apos;
this must only be in the interests of the investor .
I express my wholehearted support for the report in the belief that at some point the Commission will prepare a similar report on the regions I have mentioned .
unfortunately , the Budgets Committee did not accept our proposals , although they would not cost a penny and do in fact reflect a broad consensus within the Committee on External Economic Relations , having been drafted by the various groups within the committee .
that Cairo conference , like many other international conferences , is often called into question , some people regarding it only as a mass of good intentions , soon forgotten .
in their different ways , all three symbolise the fight to consolidate human rights in the world .
the unfortunate victim of the rape did not , however , receive any kind of compensation or psychological support even though this could have been made available to her .
this was a so-called pipeline that was created between budget lines 3307 - information policy - and 3308 .
the specific geographic features of these areas give rise to particular problems which must be reflected in coordinated strategies and measures .
( PL ) Mr President , thank you very much for your patience .
nutritional supplements should be subject to the same rules as additive premixes , given that both categories of products generally contain the same proportion of additives .
the complicated regulations which even Brussels eurocrats often find confusing are a major contributor to the defective nature of the system .
the governments have very few cards left to play with and not for nothing has it been said that the euro could lead to a recipe for stagnation .
you cannot complain about the European Parliament concerning itself with this matter and then be dissatisfied that nuclear technology is not safe enough .
you would describe it as outreach work .
we are looking forward to continuing working with the European Parliament .
I have asked the European regulators to provide a report on what actually caused this blackout .
why ?
( the speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
in the case of Portugal , a salary cut on the national minimum wage was already planned for the beginning of this year .
in the social sphere we must try to achieve the defined millennial development goals , to encourage a sustainable consumption model , to combat diseases , and to direct more official development aid to education about health and environmental issues .
I believe that that this corresponds to the concerns expressed by Mrs Berès .
– Mr President , in your opening speech you recalled the death of Nicola Calipari , but I would rather call it the murder of Nicola Calipari .
it is the result of free trade , of financial deregulation , of the illicit but permitted flight of capital to tax havens , and of war and conflicts fed by disputes over natural resources .
firstly , the amendments tabled with this in mind by my esteemed colleagues Mrs Schleicher , Mrs Flemming , Mr Wieland , Mrs Emilia Müller and Mr Bernd Lange are unrealistic in practice , as the same vessel is often taken from one water system to another , either by road or by driving it along canals or water channels .
if Copenhagen was the all-or-nothing summit - as the President-in-Office of the Council said - Cancún must be the summit that provides a variety of viable and efficient options .
they are totally dependant on the sector ’ s future restructuring , and it is essential , where there is cessation of industrial activity , that they be considered by strengthening the conditions that manufacturers will have to satisfy in order to receive aid from the restructuring fund .
so just do it at last ; pay no heed to those who whisper lies in your ear , and do not succumb to the deceitful intoxication of power .
in writing . - ( DE ) Across the board , our small farmers , who are the salt of the earth , are being submerged in a sea of irrelevant bureaucracy and subjected to satellite surveillance , and woe betide them if their fence is standing a little too far to the right or the left .
taking this approach as the basis for Commission action , the Commission will maintain and is considering increasing its assistance to North Korea .
the two go hand in hand and support each other .
the Commission thinks that the Parliament needs to be fully involved in this important matter , therefore this proposal will be based on codecision .
our amendments are an attempt to change that just a little .
it also means that proportionality is required when meting out punishment and demanding refunds and this applies both to demands by the Commission and to refunds demanded by the Member States .
of course , the value of the euro has fallen in relation to the dollar and , to a lesser extent , in relation to the yen and the pound .
for that we have LEONARDO and SOCRATES , in which facilities may be found .
fourthly , the Lisbon Summit , midway through the Portuguese presidency , gave another sign in favour of abandoning the European welfare model and changing to the American model .
I hope that we will not jeopardise the entire directive on account of a too principled stance on one point .
thus execution has resumed of some ECU 240m ; for the rest the examination continues and the Commission should take its decision on 14 July 1998 .
I am pleased that political consensus was found within Parliament and also with the Council of Ministers to resolve this issue .
besides sectors such as metalwork , the construction industry , electrical work or forestry , I would also like to highlight the high-risk jobs of doctors and healthcare staff , who in their jobs are exposed to huge risks of infection and AIDS , tuberculosis , hepatitis and many other infections .
these are two elements which I think we need to develop in the coming months .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I congratulate you on presenting a truly high-quality , realistic programme for Europe and also on your personal growth .
 
one bright spot is the fact that the European Commission has put children &apos;s rights on the agenda , but the Commission &apos;s proposal , in our view , still comprises too many fine words and too few specific measures .
at the same time as achieving savings and efficiency , we must create criteria for what constitutes a good deal for human beings .
.
it is important here to stress that medicinal products used in adults should only be subject to investigation for their use in children where this is reasonable and necessary .
I consider today &apos;s debate important and I share the view of the rapporteur that , with a little more time , we still have a good chance of achieving a result together and reaching a sound compromise .
I note that there are concerns .
quotas are a very important asset to farmers .
accurate information on local , national and European tourism will help the EU to develop effective policies and to encourage tourism in Europe .
we cannot allow this to make it more difficult for refugees and asylumseekers to reach a safe country .
this process forms an integral part of the post-Lisbon Strategy .
following comitology procedures , the draft Commission decision will then have to be discussed by this House before being finalised .
I would quote something Mrs Lalumière said , if I am not mistaken : united we can do a great deal .
I note in particular that the report highlights that the reconstruction of the region must not be regarded as merely physical and economic but must also be aimed at the social infrastructure , civil society and the public institutions .
I consider it also of great significance that thanks to the Directive , enterprises will be better informed , more knowledgeable and less dependent .
the Council Decision under discussion ( 2002 / 956 / JHA ) establishes protection of public figures as defined in the national legislation of a Member State or pursuant to the regulations of an international or supranational organisation or institution .
yes .
does it , Mr Kyprianou , have new facts in its possession from Romania or other Member States of the European Union ?
thank you very much for your contributions . I think that this has been a fruitful debate , a useful debate and a debate which demonstrates that the dialogue between the various institutions of the Union is working .
the President &apos;s phrasing - and I will take the liberty of checking the Minutes from this morning - did not imply that the President endorsed the proposer &apos;s concern . The phrasing was this : &apos; Does the House have any objectives ? &apos;
this is an important moment for liberalisation of the European economy .
regrettably , the revision of the TEN-E annexes failed to take the geo-political situation into account .
of course the Commission will review on a regular basis what is happening in this area , in particular how the market will react to this proposal if it is accepted , but the moment for reviewing the situation and revising the proposal is five years after its adoption .
on this point , I think we need to think about the option of Structural Funds for new strategic plans in all regions in order to be able to carry out this adaptation ; and decision makers should be invited to begin that strategic revision of the territory because we do not have responsibility for that area and it will be very difficult to work on it from Europe .
as MEP for the worst affected regions , I welcome the allocation of these funds to repair the damage caused by the storm : it comes as a real relief to all the French départements affected .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the legislative proposal voted on today , which I supported , outlines the importance of pharmaceutical industries in their delicate role as sources of non-promotional information on their products .
in many countries , for example , there are payroll taxes which contribute to the level of unemployment .
this acquis means a lot to Eastern and Central European countries , also for historical reasons , because it provides the opportunity to travel freely without barriers .
first of all , I have a remark to make about the reality as it is perceived .
I therefore call on the Commission to remedy this shortcoming by taking appropriate action to come up with a typology of pension systems in Member States as well as with a common set of definitions in order to make systems comparable .
Mr President , as rapporteur I cannot but agree with that .
as someone has already pointed out in this debate , not all quarries that are extractive industries are the same .
indeed , it is the position of one of the largest component parties of the EPP that there should not be an extension of qualified majority voting .
it has also made it possible for us to give the European External Action Service a solid and timely basis .
it therefore goes against not only the spirit but the very letter of your Constitution .
although Poland is not currently a member of the EU , but hopes to be before too long , it was clear that there was much work which still had to be done in an attempt to produce a more cooperative effect between the different law enforcement authorities .
not a single vote .
as for the opt-out , Parliament could never have accepted its undefined generalisation because , in practical terms , this would have simply meant the deregulation of the labour market .
implementation must take place in ways which the European Union itself sometimes does not allow to proceed .
if we want to be taken notice of and to represent the Union , then we must send the message out in every direction that we are here and that our role is not cosmetic .
in fact I was just showing President Borrell an album of Georgian sites .
the Commission replied ( H-0024 / 01 ) that it was of the opinion that a tax of general application as originally conceived by Professor Tobin ( &apos; Tobin tax &apos; ) , if introduced by a Member State , was likely to be contrary to Article 56 , together with Articles 12 , 39 , 43 , 49 and the corresponding articles of the EEA Agreement and that such a tax , if introduced at Community level , was also unlikely to be possible under Article 57 ( 2 ) of the EC Treaty , since that article provided for restrictive measures only in a limited number of areas .
for example , the Social Agenda attaches little importance to local economies and to small and medium-sized enterprises , which are key elements in economic development and jobs , and are responsible for over 90 % of business activity in Europe .
I hope that we really will succeed in sending a clear signal to Europeans that the EU can make a difference of benefit to us all in this area .
Mr Rato , the Minister of Economic Affairs , says he will not pay a penny , a peseta or an ECU to this programme through the ERDF ; Mr Arenas , the Employment Minister , says he will not give a penny or an ECU through the European Social Fund ; and the Minister of Agriculture says she will not cofinance even half of what was agreed .
the first – and , for me , the most important set of reasons – is the need for the European Union to be credible in delivering the renewed Lisbon Agenda on growth and jobs .
however , the legal basis for this mechanism should be amended to use Article 174 , which involves codecision ; and the preventative measures should be extended to cover civil protection in third countries and marine pollution .
it is for this reason that the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs on this report demands that all measures provided by Parliament be implemented , particularly with regard to CIA flights and the illegal detention of suspected terrorists .
we are , however , able to support those parts of the resolution that take account of the social and humanitarian situation of refugees and immigrants and that try to improve it .
however , it also seems very legitimate to look at the possibilities for energy recovery .
it is only when we work with such authorities , who have vital in-depth knowledge of regional employment needs and peculiarities at their disposal , that we shall be able to reap the potential benefits outlined in this report .
finally , a few words about the directive on passenger registration .
having said that , I am convinced that , in future , we will need to extend our vigilance to other spheres of activity .
generally speaking , one cannot assume that a single vaccine exists that will offer protection against the hundred or so different foot and mouth disease strains that are found .
Mr President , we cannot carry on helping the Palestinian people if their government does not help them , if it does not reject terrorism entirely and for good , if it does not renounce violence and if it does not recognise the State of Israel and the agreements that have been reached between the Palestinian National Authority and the other party in the peace process .
( Speech shortened pursuant to Rule 137 ( 1 ) of the Rules of Procedure )
naturally , the developments in Iran and North Korea are crucial in this connection .
this decision will be both political and based on fact .
and that is just one example .
with regard to consumers , legislators must demand labelling of doses that can be efficiently measured as accurately as possible , in accordance with scientific knowledge .
for its part , the European Council took these considerations on board , reaffirming in the conclusions of the GAER Council of 21 July 2003 the European Union &apos;s fundamental commitment to a successful conclusion of the Doha Development Agenda by the end of 2004 , the DDA being a single undertaking aimed at achieving an ambitious , comprehensive and balanced package of agreements .
however , as everyone knows , European Union aid , like aid from individual states , even the wealthiest ones , and aid from international institutions , is only a drop in the ocean of poverty under which these countries are submerged .
at the same time , it strikes me that a European definition of the family is urgently needed ; after all , it is what we have to work with .
over 20 % European suffer from diseases linked to excessive noise levels .
Europe &apos;s political leaders should be grateful that they have an independent central bank which is prepared to act in order to prevent Europe from lapsing into stagflation , low growth and rising inflation .
however , Romania has responded to all the enquiries from the European institutions , received the CIA committee and supplied all the relevant information .
does the Commission have any plans to elaborate a common and simple set of rules in order to increase the participation of SMEs in EU research programmes ?
we will bring this issue up again .
I warmly welcome this step , although I personally consider the transitional period to be too long rather than too short .
moreover , the Treaty of Lisbon has introduced a solidarity clause for the provision of assistance to Member States suffering the consequences of natural disasters .
notwithstanding this , I also realise that at present , we do not have a majority that is prepared to adopt this perspective .
on the contrary , I propose creating an area of preferential relations , which would help it in its economic and social development and would support the steps taken to create a stable democracy .
the Commission will present its proposals for the reform of structural policy as part of the Santer Package in July this year , and will spell them out in detail in its proposals for a review of the Structural Funds regulation in early 1998 .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , previous speakers have recalled the events leading up to this decision on Community guidelines on the trans-European transport network , as well as the lengthy discussions that preceded the compromise agreement .
this initiative is central for the Union , since it is a test of whether we are capable of collective responsibility in difficult situations .
that will no doubt mean that the member countries will step up their inspection activities , because those of us who know the fleets well are aware that the dispute is still lurking beneath the surface and that rules are still being broken , as the Commission &apos;s own reports indicate .
first , rules for disclosure of basic information about the company &apos;s social and environmental impacts .
what you said about the provisions of the directive on a mass influx of displaced persons being applied before it is applied in the Member States was most interesting .
Mr President , I hope that this subject will not get bogged down in considerations of political correctness and image-building .
earlier in this conciliation , Swedish snuff was discussed , and we believe that a good solution has been arrived at in this area too .
as for the operational expenditure , the European budget has its own internal logic .
the debate is closed .
we cannot postpone the approval of resolutions and democratic standards which protect democrats against the terrorists and against those who prevent the exercise of the democratic freedom of Europe &apos; s citizens .
it has been shot to tatters from all corners .
listening to various honourable Members , one has the impression that their countries should never have acceded to this Union , because everything is evidently better where they live , and the Union makes nothing but mistakes .
for this reason , the action plan ends by explaining its precautionary and purely repressive effects , and it concerns not only immovable assets but also and especially movable assets , current bank accounts , stocks and bonds , stakes in companies and financial transactions .
.
we must provide the backbone for this debate : this House and the European political parties .
unfortunately , politicians in the Member States are reluctant to take the necessary measures for fear of losing popularity or because of short-sighted political calculations or even sheer ignorance at times .
donation should also be voluntary , and therefore requires obligatory informed and written consent by the living donor .
for European standardisation , the challenge is to achieve close cooperation between the creators of standards , innovators , academics and researchers .
in other respects EU support for the draft moratorium would , in all other circumstances , be the best backing we could offer the victims of all despots .
the Commission is inundated with topics of a European nature , such as agriculture , effects on developing countries and trade conflicts .
firstly I would like to say that I agree with Mr Harrison that the burden of proof should lie with the Commission and that we should apply a general principle of caution to all artificial food additives .
.
in my opinion , the Commission document and the Rothley report both do their best to twist the terms invention , innovation and technical application so that the human gene can be made to fit into the strait-jacket of patent law .
proof of this lies in the positive outlook for consumption and household confidence .
the payments to farmers in these areas compensate farmers &apos; additional costs and income forgone , which occur due to the existing natural handicap .
indeed , by a happy coincidence , the designs for the future euro banknotes were presented at this same Council , giving a recognizable face to Europe &apos;s currency , and demonstrating the very tangible nature of this project of ours , which concerns every European and is a tool in the struggle for jobs .
I voted in favour of this recommendation because I approve of the conclusion of an agreement which , on the one hand , will benefit European and Canadian companies and airlines by saving millions of euro , thanks to shorter and simpler certification procedures , and , on the other hand , will ensure a higher level of security for passengers .
many people in the European Union , Commissioner , are waiting for the Commission to take action .
the EPLP maintains its position on the issue of corporate taxation , which is not to support a recalculation of the corporate tax base .
at the same time , the so-called Convention which is drafting a Charter of Fundamental Rights for the European Union is stubbornly refusing to take this principle into consideration .
yet we must be aware that globalisation also has some worrying aspects , for certain regions of Europe in particular .
as regards the implementation of the directive in the area of social services - to the extent that they are covered by it - this does not seem to have raised particular problems .
the globalisation of risks should further encourage the European authorities to develop supervision rules at international level .
second , I look forward to working with your presidency on the implementation of patient mobility .
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 4 December 2008 .
Mr President , I understand that this report welcomes the inclusion of Armenia , Azerbaijan and Georgia into the European neighbourhood policy and the endorsement of bilateral European Neighbourhood Policy action plans .
the current situation would benefit from a bold approach .
one black sheep is enough to undermine safety .
what I wish to ask the Council is : what will happen to those who have caught less than their quota this year , since the Commission closed the fishing grounds last week ?
there is only one point on which I do not agree with the report . Establishing a transport fund using cohesion policy money is not something that I can support .
the next item is the Council statement on the annual report on human rights followed by a debate .
there is not even a reference to the fact that in the Member States the Community model should preferably be used .
I thank all those who voted for me .
the second major area is , of course , that of further training .
he is the self-appointed mediator in this outrageous piece of trickery .
but we live in hope and that is why we are asking that these steps be taken .
my second observation is that I hope the organizers and sports organizations will in the future more willingly accept that it is better to discuss these problems with the relevant Community authorities than to challenge continually the authority of the European Commission and to continue to refer back to a particular government or minister to deal with problems of competition .
the proposal made in this respect , as I understand it , takes this approach and I am certain that the Commission could assess it and evaluate it in its proposals for the employment guidelines .
if one were to look at this solely from the point of view of the safety of human beings , one would have to demand immediate rebuilding , with bi-directional tunnels and so on . If , though , one considers these things in relation to costs – which one also has to do – then a new middle way has to be found .
when we look at the legal systems in many countries , we find the actual application of law is unacceptable .
I am delighted to see Mrs Schreyer here today , who hopefully is going to talk about accounting control .
it is very important that , after a very long period of debate , the right balance has been struck and thus we have , on the one hand , the opening of the services market and the facilitation of investments by eliminating bureaucratic , legal and technical obstacles and , on the other hand , full respect for workers &apos; rights - as the European trades union accepted in February - and , at the same time of course , exemptions for certain particular sectors .
at worst , transportation may result in illnesses such as rabies being spread to countries that , until now , have been free from rabies , possibly including new EU countries .
the problem at the moment is not only funding , but access , particularly to Gaza .
hence , it is obvious that the European Union supports the Iranian opposition .
the vast majority clearly treat their animals in a good and humane manner .
if this factory is not entitled to compensation under the EU support scheme , however , there is real danger that it will not be able to continue operating .
the document also accentuates the importance to these enterprises of innovation , scientific research , patents and inventions and protecting intellectual property , and e-commerce .
what is happening in the Mediterranean is surely a difficult signal to understand , which is why Europe must speak up and act with solidarity which would , at this time , probably help the regions exposed to increased migration pressures in the Mediterranean .
on 9 November , the European Commission deemed illegal the FRF 1.8 thousand million in aid granted by the French Government to Le Havre &apos;s workshops and shipyards , demanding that it be returned in accordance with the rules of competition .
but the day after Christmas Day - Boxing Day , as we call it in Britain - I do not know what it is called elsewhere in the European Union - we shall sit round our family table and we will eat a nice piece of British beef .
the rich were able to buy votes from the poor without the electoral commission being able to stop them .
the Prime Minister of Israel has apologised and ordered a full investigation .
I conveyed that through face-to-face meetings we would succeed in clarifying misunderstandings and overcoming distrust .
but if the United States had followed Mrs Read &apos;s policy , it would never have arrived where it is .
despite difficulties and shortcomings in the national parliamentary system it is here that democratic legitimacy develops .
I can see that there is quite a good chance of us attempting on a voluntary basis to declare schools as drug-free areas , to make it clear to schoolchildren through education that a life without drugs should be their main goal .
last but not least , we should not forget that the consumers &apos; rights should also function in the field of services , including the financial services and the services in the digital environment , where the degree of risk is much higher and it is much more difficult to prove the infringement of rights .
this is also the reason why we have been feeling relatively overlooked and have abstained from voting .
amendment No 13 cannot be endorsed , because it would oblige all airports to apply a system of noise taxes and Amendments Nos 18 , 19 and 20 are not only ruled out because the inclusion or reference to harmonised European objectives is outside the scope of this proposal , but also because they are completely incompatible with the method proposed for the calculation of charges on noise emissions .
against that background , Mr Hammerstein Mintz tabled a few amendments to the report by Mr Wieland , which he as rapporteur and the committee as a whole unanimously supported .
yesterday we heard a speech by a leading European head of government who , as the host of the G20 summit next week , said the opposite of what you said here as President-in-Office of the Council .
the UN is the sole authority competent to decide in favour of international military intervention , and we must invite the United States to join Europe in committing itself , on the one hand , to multilateralism and respect for international law and , on the other , to reform of the United Nations , particularly as regards the Security Council and the way it is made up .
– I should like to start by thanking the Commissioner for his transparency and comprehensive reply to my question .
a more environmentally correct distribution might be based on the amount of pasture land a farmer has , rather than providing support in proportion to the number of animals , as is now the case .
because of the time I have available , I would like to mention a few specific points which I do not think are very clear in the report .
I wonder if the European Parliament - which has to assess whether it wants such agreements or not - has not already got enough ability to express itself politically , both during and at the end of negotiations .
if we are to have these checks , we need an infrastructure , and this infrastructure also means resting points , for which we must make provision , and loading stations where vehicles must be obliged to dock when the provisions on the protection of animals in transit are breached .
without widespread public support the European Union will lack popular legitimacy for what it is doing .
poor people in far-flung rural areas often find it hard , if not impossible , to attend school because it is just too far for them to go .
at a time when we are celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the Treaties of Rome , I would like to place particular emphasis on the political responsibility of the European Union for drawing up the terms , and opening the way , for future membership of the Union to Serbia .
over and above the challenges of fair trade for development , this report illustrates the need for a more generalized correction of a global trade regime which involves absolutely no parameters as regards development or the environment , or any social clauses .
however , I consider that what is of the utmost importance is not only to criticise and condemn the current regime but also to eliminate any possibility of European funds intended to help the people of Guinea being misappropriated .
the EEAS must come under the Commission for administrative and budgetary matters and must be officially part of the Commission .
five per cent is not significant .
how do you envisage new ways of trying to generate stimulus in economies of the EU countries ?
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , while thanking the President of the Commission and Mr Tajani for their efforts , we of Lega Nord must say that we are completely and utterly dissatisfied .
the main problem that arises in my eyes is that of the settlement of disputes .
however , the situation is not getting any better .
finally , we will carefully study Amendments Nos 1 , 2 and 3 , which refer to the textual differences between linguistic versions , in relation to the definition of vehicles .
this week &apos;s developments will make it harder than ever to relaunch the six-party talks , but , in the medium to long term , this framework remains the best chance for a lasting solution .
therefore , I have voted in favour of this report .
( GA ) Madam President , I voted in favour of the resolution relating to the arrangement between the European Union and Cameroon and between the European Union and the Republic of Congo regarding forest law and trade in timber from those countries .
during certain periods , the working groups met every day for a number of hours .
subject to final technical verifications , texts have been agreed on important points such as the Financial Regulation , certification by Member States and the review clause .
it is our job to remind everyone of this and I very much hope that in future , there will be another resolution on partnership between the Parliament of Azerbaijan and the European Parliament , as unfortunately this was unsuccessful two weeks ago .
in the current climate , it is right that we should do what we are proposing now .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , research and innovation policy is one of the three main pillars of the polices of the European Union .
what gives consumers peace of mind , more than directives being updated every fortnight , is being able to trust in the rigorousness and proper functioning of market surveillance ; in other words , in the fact that , if someone tries to sell unsafe toys , he or she will be punished and the dangerous products withdrawn from the market .
secondly , according to analyses carried out by independent research centres , as a result of the conclusion of a free trade agreement , two thirds of the benefits accruing from such an agreement would go to Korea , and only one third to the European Union .
for a liberal , these freedoms are at the heart of our democracy and are non-negotiable preconditions for EU membership .
more and more people are starting to have doubts about the value of the fast track to integration and indeed about the value of the Treaties which Mr Barnier , who has moved all the way from Gaullism to centrism finding no middle ground , would like to see enshrined in the constitution .
this is what is crucial .
we have included these in our amendments which we hope will be adopted tomorrow in a resolution , so that Europe will be sending out a clear message in this respect .
the protein deficit in Europe and the imbalance between animal and plant protein production constitute a problem that has been getting worse , affecting changes to human consumption habits , food quality and security , and the crisis faced by livestock farmers .
neither have I heard that anything is wrong with the performance , quite the opposite , in fact .
Mr President , I will be even more brief .
.
yes , these tests will be carried out in every Member State , including Austria .
if we all work together properly on that , and if the Council is well disposed , we will manage to get this report adopted by the end of this Parliamentary term - I think , at second reading stage or perhaps after a conciliation procedure - and then legal certainty will have been created .
however , that is not the case with this proposal .
thank you , Mr President-in-Office of the Council .
road safety would also be improved .
I would see it as sensible today to accept a baseline period of 2007-2009 , to set an emissions ceiling at a level of between 5 to 10 % over 100 % in view of the rising interest in flying , and to include in addition non-EU carriers operating within the EU .
we would point out that these people are applying for international protection and that their application has not yet been examined in detail .
the first report was drawn up on the initiative of the Kingdom of Belgium , and relates to the adjusting of the basic salary and allowances of Europol staff .
although it is contrary to our voting list , I would nevertheless like to ask my honourable colleagues to vote in favour of this amendment as well as in favour of the whole report in the second vote .
it may affect them somewhat , but it is not going to affect them that much in the long run .
to be sure , as you have emphasised , progress has been made , particularly in the creation of the international arrest warrant , but the process has been held back by the Member States ’ lack of political will to make European decisions truly effective .
that directive is certainly in need of improvement , but in its own context and not this one .
in our view , the axes which could create a basis for its support are : the addition of material capital for tourism in the new review which will also constitute a legal base for the sector , the framing of a Community tourism policy to support the sector without disturbing the operation of the tourism market , coordination of the tourism policy with other , parallel Community policies which affect it directly or indirectly , a study of the sector , and the adoption of medium and long-term measures to enhance the competitiveness of tourism as a product .
in this delicate field of data protection we must achieve two fundamental objectives : transparency in the future functioning of the secretariat and the independence of its work .
then the Turkish Prime Minister , Mr Erdogan , went to Germany to remind the Turks living there not to adapt too well and to demand the establishment of Turkish universities in Europe .
we welcome the intention of working towards universal ratification of the Ottawa Convention and an effective Review Conference in 2009 .
another word in reply to a group of Members of Parliament , particularly Mr McCartney , Mr McMahon and Mr McCartin , who raised the problem of salmon .
furthermore , the method of calculating the reduction in support in the event of this quantity being exceeded needs to be amended .
we believe the actions and approaches you have described in your speech , Mr President , provide an excellent picture of the contribution the Italian presidency has made to overcoming the obstacles in the way of the integration process .
tomorrow , therefore , we must vote for this document . &apos;
we should offer every assistance to enable Russia to make a successful transition to democracy and the market economy . This transition is proving much longer , more painful and more complex than had been anticipated .
as for me , after the presidium meeting I visited the Érmellék area of Partium .
many colleagues from different countries have come to Mr Schnellhardt , myself and other colleagues and asked for certain changes because of their traditional production .
I believe that nobody has the right to decide about the life or death of another person , be it at the beginning or the end of that life , and certainly not in connection with punishing a criminal act .
other speakers have already pointed out how many questions are still unanswered here .
this should allow discussion in Parliament and Council to start from an equal basis .
this might also challenge and undermine our existing sophisticated restrictive measures which make it possible for the European Union to take temporary measures on a consultation basis with the exporting countries .
the lack of transparency on world oil markets facilitates speculation and inhibits investment in the oil sector .
otherwise , the EU would fall into the trap of protectionism and of increasing subsidies to various special interests within agriculture .
these amendments refer mainly to the modus operandi of the board of directors , the provision of technical assistance by the Centre to the aforementioned countries and the Centre &apos;s help with evaluation procedures at national , European and international level .
the United Nations mission is now preparing for withdrawal from Kosovo .
Mr President , I asked the Commissioner a question which he has not answered .
both the Court of Auditors and the Committee on Budgetary Control have issued a positive opinion on the implementation of the budget of the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking for the financial year 2009 .
this means partnership , which , on the one hand , aims at the clear representation of interests , but also , on the other , their equalisation by means of information and consultation in shared dialogue .
it is very important that the European Union is very active in putting in place new waste management proposals .
let us try to spell it out .
it is surprising that they have not been carried out before .
the perpetrator makes the profit ; external costs are left for others to pay .
Mr President , one of the main mechanisms for the integration of Europe is the enlargement of the European Union .
one of the most important ways in which we should measure any deal made in Copenhagen is to look at the way in which it helps the developing world deal with the challenge of climate change .
as my predecessors on the floor have said , however , there are a number of points to which we are keen to give further attention , such as the issue of the Syrian military presence .
we are a global player because we are not just a project for Europeans .
we began late and we will finish late .
all systems , be they national parliamentary or European Parliamentary systems , have methods of delegating powers to the executive : implementing powers , secondary legislation - call them what you like .
it would be an unheard-of abuse of a Member who would see himself illegitimately deprived of his parliamentary mandate , and an unprecedented and unique breach of the treaties which , on electoral matters , clearly recognise the pre-eminence of the laws , procedures and authority of the Member States .
it has perhaps taken too long for us to become aware that there is a limit to financial growth .
another fundamental point is sanctions : a system of sanctions - which will , of course , be deferred until the various States have fully defined them - which can be used to punish the airlines and other parties concerned in the event that these rules are violated .
Mr President , many of us are convinced that the best instrument for regulating labour relations is dialogue between the social partners , and if that dialogue can be translated into agreements , so much the better .
I have asked Mr Westendorp to come to the Committee on Budgetary Control next week and explain this fact to us , because we are not getting any detailed information from the Commission about what is going on .
many of the toxic substances that workers are exposed to at work can be carried home , for example by way of their clothing .
what academics have called the terrorist criminal nexus is well established .
there is no contradiction whatsoever .
that is why we cannot endorse the extension of the directive to cover agricultural products .
it was one of the priority issues of the year , calling for great flexibility and capacity for compromise , but the Commission proved incapable of dialogue and perhaps lacked common sense .
only in that way can we identify the real political will which was our starting-point .
we do not as yet have a legislative initiative based on the Treaty of Lisbon , but we have been promised an answer on our expectations from the Commission .
regarding the debates on cases of breaches of human rights , the EPP-ED Group has moved that the item entitled &apos; Uzbekistan &apos; be replaced by an item entitled &apos; Pakistan &apos; .
what goes on in the depths of this House , particularly in the evenings , is a scandal .
I am really extremely curious to hear what you have to say on this matter .
at the first reading , Mr Fayot and myself took the liberty of proposing an amendment stating the concerns of the Luxembourg legal environment with regard to the formalities required for the registration with the competent authority of a foreign advocate .
there was the greatest concern about the political and security developments both in Gaza and in Israel , but also recognition that there is no alternative to continuing this humanitarian support and , on the other hand , to exploring how to support this Arab peace initiative .
this is an important step forward for international solidarity and a clear sign of the European Union &apos;s commitment to a successful summit .
I would , however , point out that , in the case of Italy , the ban by the control authority on access to data collected by the company , Alitalia , has not met with negative reactions or sanctions from the United States authorities .
I would also like to stress an important matter - supervision of this aid .
as a consumer , I am very pleased about this compulsory labelling because it will allow us to make an informed choice , although I would have preferred stricter rules that required a very clear indication on the outside packaging !
a number of issues of specific institutional interest to Parliament arose .
Mr President , Commissioner , Minister , I have to say that my assessment of the Lisbon resolutions and , above all , of the goal , so often evoked in this House , of making the economy of the European Union the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world , can be summed up like this : it is an empty , rhetorical formula with little or nothing to do with what is or is not really happening in the economies of the European countries .
after several years , both are eligible for transfer back to their home Member State .
but overall , I think I can say that this arrangement satisfies the wishes of the European Parliament .
in fact , although this is designed to protect the few consumers who have allergies to certain fragrances , the proposal is unlikely to provide a significant public health benefit .
but much more needs to be done if Chechnya is to progress to democratic stability .
could I thank Commissioner Patten for coming here at short notice to respond to our wish to debate this very critical issue and as others have said , the television pictures that we have seen of the stricken Limpopo valley in Mozambique are absolutely heartbreaking .
the debate is closed .
I should like once again to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Sacconi , and Mrs Ek and Mr Nassauer , for the truly huge effort which they made to bring us to this compromise , which relates to one of the most important aspects of REACH .
we will not eliminate poverty and hunger from the world without the help of the market .
to do so is in breach of the Rules of Procedure , and I insist that we stop debating this subject and move on to the proper agenda .
Parliament has declared itself to be in favour of seeking a definitive solution for this sector , within the framework of the COM in fruit and vegetables .
I was there recently and I saw that the buildings were finished , but there were no technical installations .
however , I do not agree with the decision to reduce the type of activities list to such a great extent , as the target countries are still given the opportunity to create barriers to service provision .
but the election itself led Mrs Lalumiere as chairman for the international election observatory to say that it was possible to award it the grade &apos; approved with some hesitation &apos; .
by means of the possibility of quota buy-back - the basis for Amendments Nos 8 , 9 , 27 and 28 - the Commission wishes to provide a safety net for economically weak producers who are not in a position to participate in the campaign for improved quality .
indicators are a concise way of interpreting a given phenomenon .
we are worth the same and deserve the same .
now established as a free market economy , it is true that Laos is still ruled by a regime which , if not one-party , is certainly one-party dominant .
first of all , we must get this implemented properly and consistently in every Member State ; and secondly , it must result in a change of culture which says that it is simply no longer acceptable for large customers to exploit small businesses by paying them late .
the statement that a bad regulation is better than none at all represents a show of political incompetence and is wrong .
on the basis of earlier decisions by the CD coalition , this post was awarded to the Polish Member , Mr Saryusz-Wolski .
why should the average of such dissimilar amounts , for duties so different from ours , miraculously produce a fair and acceptable result ?
the answer is no .
we expect the government to make further progress in its reform agenda , to strengthen the rule of law and to implement the Ohrid Framework Agreement .
surveys demonstrate quite clearly a variety of different costs of different printer operating systems , all brought about by operators using these methods which oblige the consumer to buy printer cartridges over and over again , instead of reusing and refilling .
moreover , it is precisely female occupations that are automatically less well paid as it is , even though they are by no means easy and require a great deal of effort .
I give the floor to Mrs Oomen-Ruijten , to move the request .
I would like to pick up on some further enhancements that we have made as a result of the second reading .
today , this House is asked to consider the proposal for a Council Regulation intended to establish the system for monitoring the ceilings .
the vote will be taken at 12 noon tomorrow .
despite this , there are still many people who are reluctant to wake up from their bad nuclear dream .
we are vehemently opposed , however , to some of the key points in the report .
in our view Serbia is part of it .
although the only amendment tabled by the Committee on Fisheries is an amendment proposing a slight increase in appropriations for monitoring actions , we would like to take this opportunity to repeat a series of priorities that form the core of the committee &apos;s actions .
unfortunately , I cannot go into all of them due to a lack of time .
the restraint systems currently available on the market are sufficiently well designed to enable their use to be made compulsory .
what is vital in my view is to accept the Commission &apos;s proposal that states that no legislative act can be adopted in the Community without the European Parliament &apos;s approval .
in addition , the report provides further constructive ideas for an even more effective monitoring of the fisheries policy .
thus , it is wholly unclear when science is to intervene , when disease control measures are to be announced , and when political action is to be taken .
but in this resolution it is not even clear that the proposers are against the construction of new nuclear power stations .
Tunisia has concluded an association agreement with the European Union which contains a clear human rights clause .
being global and competitive does not mean tearing ourselves away from our national culture , and being competitive does not mean taking away the human essence of the men and women of the world .
after all , we are not against the introduction of harmonised energy taxation in principle .
another point is the debate on artisanal fisheries and fisheries which use very large , very efficient ships .
we observed during the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon how a single person , a single state president was able to play with the whole system .
Mr President , I too would like to congratulate Mr Collins on his excellent report and indeed for accepting my amendments on the health aspects of air travel .
for reasons of accuracy , I would like to refer to a point that has been made in this debate that the great omission from this report was the failure to mention indigenous peoples .
Mr Ghilardotti described the facts .
of the EUR 1 919 million requested , only EUR 784 million have been granted .
how strange that the Commission should lose its instinct for self-preservation just as Europe is integrating . I think there are three reasons for this : 1 ) in their endeavour to transcend the nation states , the European institutions have lost touch with the people and , in losing touch with the people , they have become putty in the hands of foreign interests ; 2 ) having lost touch with the people , the men and women working in these institutions have started to become used to reasoning not as the sole champions of the people , but as international officials in charge of regulating a global system ; 3 ) integration may afford economies of scale and productivity gains ; but it also causes far more to be lost because , when it breaks nations , it breaks subtle expressions of solidarity and , with them , the willingness to present a united front .
15 . Situation in Japan , including the nuclear power plant alerts (
again , I thank Mr Nisticò for his sympathetic acceptance of colleagues &apos; views and of our amendments in the various areas .
it is a fact that Tajikistan is at a nerve point , in a geopolitical position , and Europe should examine how we can manage to reduce both crime , in connection with drugs from Afghanistan , and - first and foremost - migratory movements .
if that is still correct , would it be possible for you to invite the groups which have requested all these roll call votes on all the amendments to reconsider , because it seems that we can make the political points by having one roll call vote at the end ?
by mixing facts with assumptions and unconfirmed rumours , the report is in danger , however , of weakening , rather than strengthening , the justified criticism .
we now need statistics focused on energy demand as much as on energy supply .
that , I believe , is above all what basically distinguishes our own labour market from those in the United States , Japan and elsewhere .
I believe these issues should be borne in mind in respect of the subject we are now debating .
this mutual trust in the system operated by the contracting party is based on an approximation of the requirements and regulatory processes , as well as regular consultations between the parties and the establishment of a joint committee .
he also pointed out that Europe &apos; s greatest weakness was its inability to form a political entity with powers that are both solid and legitimate .
Commissioner , I therefore ask you and the Member States to be firm in implementing this regulation with the utmost possible urgency .
this is the first reason for our refusal to vote in favour of a Commission which defines its objectives with scant regard for the Treaties .
Mr President , yesterday we debated and voted on a report from the Committee on Petitions .
if we add all the agricultural policy outgoings together , they amount to a total of EUR 48.7 billion allocated to this area .
above all , we must not forget that hundreds of thousands of jobs in Europe depend on agriculture functioning .
it is not an unreasonable question to ask .
it is very welcome that this prestigious research institute has taken action and , with the support of the French Ministry of Health , is initiating an opposition procedure to the patent award .
Annex - Commission statement
a crucial aspect of this initiative concerns a fundamental value : respect for cultural and linguistic diversity .
the Amsterdam Protocol points to the need to balance financing with state aid and effects on competition .
I hope that this awareness will never be lost in the two countries that are now joining , Bulgaria and Romania , or in the other countries of the European Union .
thank you for your attention .
whilst Conservatives support co-operation between police forces , we cannot support bringing the provisions in the Prüm Treaty into the EU framework .
( the President cut off the speaker )
it is still necessary for Member States to improve substantially the collection of data , so a requirement to improve the scientific basis for eel management is an important part of my proposal .
without the backing of the UN Security Council , the United States has attacked Iraq , but we now know that their battle plans had been ready for a long time .
that is not the answer . Energy savings and the use of other forms of energy is the answer .
at present , children and young people are inadequately protected from the surfeit of sex and violence shown on our televisions .
both Bulgaria and Romania have made remarkable progress .
we need a win-win situation , that is , one in which science and teaching institutions , on the one hand , and research and business , on the other , will say &apos; yes &apos; to this partnership .
Mr President , when the suggestion is made that the European Humanities University should go back to Belarus , it is worth mentioning that it should be on the basis of genuine guarantees that it will be able to operate freely and not be taken back under the control of the regime .
Fiscalis constitutes the Community contribution to this committing but necessary task .
under our Rules of Procedure we will invite the successful candidate to speak to the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Security and Defence Policy on 21 June so that we may put a recommendation of approval to the July plenary .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I would once again like to thank Mrs Ahern for her work as rapporteur on this proposal , since she has contributed , in collaboration with the other Members , to the achievement of a very reasonable final result , which in some respects even improves on the proposals of the Commission itself and , of course , on what , from a budgetary point of view , the Council had initially accepted .
we are allowing our producers to be destroyed , as with the banana producers in Guadeloupe , the Canary Islands , Martinique and Madeira and our wine producers .
we have requested a roll-call vote and I think that tobacco producers will be interested to find out what positions various Members will adopt .
the communication shows that we can achieve our emission reduction targets without harming our economies .
one of the subjects that have created controversies is related to the certification of the on-board personnel .
after all , there is no link at all between the Member States &apos; correct implementation of the programme and an improvement in the situation of the stocks which they fish .
 
but it seems that within the Caucasus , this does not apply in the case of Chechnya .
thus , the customs of employee participation existing within the European Union were also skilfully incorporated .
I have had a huge postbag on this proposal and the reactions to it have been very mixed .
ladies and gentlemen , I turn now to the other topics on the agenda today , firstly and in particular Mr Jové &apos;s report .
7 . Coordination of safeguards required of companies ( codified version ) (
but the impact on the taxpayer and on the quality of life in the Leopold Quarter if yet another huge building were to be erected would be enormous .
the Burmese army is involved in these practices and is maltreating these victims of forced labour .
the Agency ’ s idea of chartering commercial ships , known as ‘ stand-by ships ’ , which would interrupt their commercial activities in order to be used in the area of an accident , deserves to be tested .
the report also takes account of recent changes in the political arena in Bahrain .
this is in clear violation of Article 7a of the Maastricht Treaty , which was endorsed by the Member States ; what is more , it is completely illogical in view of the cost / benefit ratio resulting from the lack of free movement for persons .
I should like to thank the rapporteurs and my colleagues .
I would rather emphasize the necessity of attacking the root of the evil , which affects the most disadvantaged women .
allow me to remind you of part of Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights : ‘ Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family , including food , clothing , housing and medical care … ’
amendment No 29 of the report by Mrs Sanders-ten Holte establishes that transport policy has primacy in the use of the single sky , and this does not sufficiently reflect the legitimate needs and concerns of the Member States from the point of view of defence .
it is unacceptable to say that this is a provisional report , when the data collected over the next nine months will be in the hands of the US administration within five years , and it might be a Sarah Palin administration , rather than the Obama administration .
I would now like to put this question to you , Mr President-in-Office : what initiatives does the Spanish Presidency intend to take in order to implement this plan as quickly as possible ?
I saw evidence of this a few days ago during a visit to the northern Czech town of Liberec .
we are addressing many demands to the Commission today .
the message is that biotechnology is controversial , possibly even dangerous and undetectable .
I would like to hear from the Commission , though , whether it has also been to take a look at the border region between Morocco and Algeria , which is where a huge number of migrants are being abandoned without food or drink in the desert , in no man ’ s land .
moreover , we presented an alternative resolution in which we wanted to clarify the role of impact assessment and external experts in the impact assessment process .
this diversity reflects different histories and cultures of state intervention .
but I believe that those of us in this House should remember that when we ask the Commission to apply codes of conduct to high-level officials , to the way in which Commissioners run their offices and so on , we should not ask the Commission to apply standards that we ourselves refuse to apply .
as regards the explanatory statement - which is not normally put to the vote - there was in fact an exchange of letters between Mr Konecny , the shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Party of European Socialists , and myself , and we achieved a broad degree of consensus on drafting the explanatory statement . I also took the unusual step of incorporating into my report all the comments of my committee colleagues , and there was a broad consensus in the committee that these too were acceptable .
during the negotiation phase the lack of appropriate transparency was deplored in the report .
we need direct action now .
most unusually , he is not with us today because he is ill .
you have been accessible to Members of this Parliament .
our most important proposal is that , in addition to the provisions of social security and labour law , collective agreements between employers and trade unions - as our proposal still terms them - should also be adhered to at the place of performance .
perhaps we ought to learn to do this one day .
thirdly , when the European Union establishes objectives and rules for itself and agrees on procedures and sanctions , the Commission must not be dependent on the agreement of the Member States in order to be able to meet its obligations .
on the contrary , it has exacerbated tensions in this country .
( RO ) I would like you to know that in my report I am going to propose setting up a European fund for energy efficiency and renewable energy to help raise the public and private funds for implementing specific energy efficiency projects across the European Union , and I would like to have the Council &apos;s support for this important initiative .
even now we witness the property of those expelled peoples being inhabited by others , and in many cases sold illegally .
ten thousand years ago we were living in caves .
this calls for cooperation in order to ensure that crime is tackled effectively , and harmonisation in order to prevent certain countries from becoming destinations for criminals .
the Commissioner spent quite a long time talking about this and I think he had every reason to .
the debate is closed .
two countries had an inflation rate of 1.5 % , namely Belgium and Germany .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all I would like to congratulate Mrs Fraga Estevez on her excellent report and on her contribution to the debate on the common fisheries policy after 2002 .
Guyana even has one of its main borders with Suriname .
we have to see to it that countries honour the commitments they have entered into .
the European Union will need to play a role in the development of the police system , but will also need to supervise the development of the judiciary , and what is more , I think it is important to invest heavily in the administrative structures as well as in the economic development to which reference has already been made .
report ( A5-0098 / 2000 ) by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , on the Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council : &quot; The Strategy for Europe &apos;s Internal Market &quot; &#91; COM ( 1999 ) 464 - C5-0212 / 1999 - 1999 / 2167 ( COS ) &#93;

on the other hand , it might be thought that , should the European Union not undertake to take US strategy into account , it would be not only the NATO headquarters in Brussels that would be under threat but that of the European institutions too !
this pyramid must be respected in a number of ways .
the common position puts European car manufacturers in a disadvantageous position in relation to manufacturers which have just come to the European market .
I would like to highlight two amendments to the Commission draft .
the adverse effects are being felt in the real economy , especially by small and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) and public authorities .
this was the question of the prescribed minimum duration of study .
the indication at Noordwijk was that this issue should not be pushed too far , which may imply that the decision on the size and composition of the Commission will be left until the time comes in the accession procedure when it has to be settled .
it is our cultural values that characterise our European Community .
more disturbingly it is a failure to appreciate the competitive dynamics of a more open global economy - of which the Taoiseach spoke so eloquently - an issue which , if not addressed , would cost Europe jobs in the long-run rather than protect European jobs , as many of the proponents of the current status quo seem to believe .
concerning the African troops , I should like to clarify matters a little .
question No 53 by Eva Kjer Hansen ( H-0656 / 96 )
at present , the promotion of sustainable economic development is high on our list of priorities .
unfortunately , some ambiguities in Europe today are preventing us from doing so .
the Commission hopes that , in the vein and in the spirit of the ongoing EU-Uganda partnership , these démarches , together with those of others , will lead to a review of the proposed legislation to make it compatible with international principles of non-discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation .
they do not occupy a post in the establishment plan and they must work under the supervision of a permanent official or a temporary agent .
Norway , which is independent of the EU , has withdrawn all demands under GATS to liberalise the service sectors of poor countries .
what is more , Parliament wants to include in Article 1 , paragraph 1 implementation of the campaign to promote renewable sources of energy already called for by the 1997 White Paper . It also wants to create new instruments and mechanisms to promote rapid and coordinated penetration of the market by all sustainable energy technologies .
there are so many things in the report and I cannot go into detail about all of them .
Belarus has also been mentioned .
the reform has very quickly become irrelevant , due to the major turnaround in the market , which demonstrates that the sector is totally at the mercy of price volatility .
during these times of crisis , it is important for us to defend the values on which our union is based and to protect the weak members of our society .
but we are delighted that it is part of our family again .
we in the Council are aware that the role of the European Parliament must be respected .
people-to-people contacts are most important in order to enhance the possibility of working together .
as I am completely in agreement with these priorities , I voted in favour of this own initiative report .
they are toxic .
nevertheless , we do not feel that adequate solutions to the problems arising for those working in the sector as a result of this process have been provided in the texts before us .
Madam President , we know that revenue from advertising through traditional media has been reduced , so the equation is simple : if we do not allow more revenue for traditional TV to be earned , then all hopes of quality productions , documentaries and cultural vibrancy are lost .
we have identified excess capacity in fishing fleets as the greatest obstacle to proper management of our waters .
however , I would strongly urge that this introduction is not , at the end of the day , used to achieve a reduction in the headage premium or in the premium for rural development .
I understand that KLM has had money because it put some runways on some former farming land .
Madam President , if the President-in-Office has a strong standpoint as the representative of the Council , why does he not publish it ?
my question to Prime Minister Topolánek is therefore the following : will the Czech Republic ensure that the emergency economic crisis programmes also work to solve the climate crisis ?
we are in no doubt that the European Parliament &apos;s influence on this subject has already given democracy strength in Turkey .
we have to have the courage to look again at the question of waste , to review the agreements concluded with third countries which do not contain specific rules and guarantees on democracy and respect for human rights ; we must support a proposal for a directive on waste management plans and domestic waste in particular ; we must encourage the fight against rampant organized crime , reinforce cooperation between the Member States and promote international organizational initiatives .
those who do best cannot be penalised .
I understand the American counterpart will be there in order to have discussions on the points which Members have raised .
the institution of the Ombudsman is very important , and it is important that we should all constantly keep an eye on it and ensure that it can thrive , in the light of the new developments too .
we had a Commission proposal seeking to establish social and environmental criteria for a sliding scale of premium payments .
certainly , this is extremely praiseworthy , but we wonder how it relates to the demands we are already making .
we are creating a stability mechanism , a permanent aid fund , which will have to be paid for by the ordinary people , by the people who will not be getting any free gifts .
a strict policy of non-vaccination such as we have long pursued in the EU is no longer relevant . Consequently , I am of the opinion that we are taking the right step here .
we need a Europe that is uncompromising when it comes to defending its values and its interests , which rejects protectionism of all kinds , but without being naive , and which can demonstrate this proactive spirit .
this can certainly result in some distortion .
Mugabe has destroyed a once prosperous country .
I accept your offer and since we 626 MEPs are the contact between the EU and the public , would you like to write each of us a simple little letter making all of us in the Parliament aware of it ?
it has been an important and very visible part of the CFSP .
I believe that our report is more serious .
I think I can be brief but would very much like to respond to the Commissioner &apos;s reply .
there is no freedom , no future , if you are not able to earn a decent living and to secure the future of your children .
time is tight and our two institutions will need to cooperate closely .
in other words , to lay as of now the foundations for shaping cohesive and effective action for civil protection ?
during his time in office , will he build on the already agreed enlargement programme ?
this is in line with the aforementioned Article 31 and also with Article 37 of the Charter . Both articles are to be enshrined in the European Constitution and will become a binding part of it .
I agree that the common agricultural policy should be adapted to the new conditions in order to better address the problems of food security , and this is why the removal of instruments which manage markets and a reduction in the level of EU expenditure on agriculture in the future financial perspective should be opposed .
for the next 10 years I believe that ensuring global competition will be vital for Europe .
therefore , the Commission has strongly encouraged the euro area Member States to take a political decision on a mechanism to ensure financial stability in the euro area as a whole , a mechanism which could be swiftly activated if needed , in conformity with the treaty and its bailout clause , and without any automaticity built into this mechanism .
in writing . - ( FR ) Mrs Castex voted for the Mantovani report on the establishment of a European Qualifications Framework .
in this respect , we face a situation in which we must acknowledge that we cannot completely eradicate fraud which damages the European Union &apos;s financial interests .
we should not have double standards depending on the interests at stake .
for me , as rapporteur for this House , it is unacceptable that ambitions which come with the Treaty of Lisbon , and which are also being promoted by the Council , should be financed at the cost of Parliament &apos;s priorities .
the Committee on Budgets has also come out strongly in favour of financial support and has provided for a total of ECU 8.65 million in 1997 , probably with some ECU 2.5 m for this programme once again .
we will have to look into it .
it is after all their own money and the EU funding regulations should not place disproportionate restrictions on the parties .
vaccination against bluetongue was carried out using live attenuated vaccines , which called for a series of restrictions on vaccination so as to avoid the spread of the virus to unvaccinated animals .
Mr President , I have three short questions .
I therefore call for the controls to be strengthened and the penalties against this illegal fishing to be properly applied .
we must be more mindful of the environment , food security and animal rights , for these are issues related to quality of life .
the further progress of Croatia in accession negotiations depends , in particular , on the completion of essential political , economic , legislative and administrative reforms .
over time , this would allow employees to acquire full rights while firms would have sufficient , but decreasing , flexibility during the probation period , removing the inhibiting elements that often prevent employees from taking on new recruits for the long term .
as long as you submit to its alleged requirements and surrender before the so-called unchanging laws of the market , you will not resolve any problems .
we must guarantee that all this remains within the limits of affordability .
this is also necessary in order to heighten public awareness of the common European approach to foreign and security policy issues .
the Council has allowed itself 236 new posts in order to prepare for enlargement .
Mr President , Commissioner Patten has referred to the dossier that was produced by the United Kingdom Government prior to the debate in the House of Commons .
before addressing the issue of Tibet , allow me a quick word on our bilateral relations with China .
as the report states , we need to guarantee the right of every human being to health care , medical services and access to medicines .
from here on things are going to be easier .
on the basis of a technical assessment carried out by the Commission in August 2004 and endorsed by the Council , the EU is now implementing an action plan aimed at addressing some of the issues faced by the Bengahzi families and also at enhancing capacities in the health sector in Libya .
capitalist competition is a form of war by all available means , such as pacts , lobbying , organised accounting practices and fudged audits , as current events illustrate .
this identification is based on economic rather than political factors .
what about the fact that there are labour camps in a large European Union Member State on the Mediterranean coast where , according to the press , 20 000 people from other Member States worked ?
international accounting and audit bodies will also benefit from more diversified neutral funding and the EU can lead off on this , but not indefinitely if other countries do not join in .
it is very frustrating when time turns a man who fought for freedom and independence into a harmful despot .
on this evening at the close of the year and in the run-up to Christmas , before midnight on a Tuesday , almost sixty years after the founding of the European Union , we are still discussing one of the pillars of European integration .
finally , can I just say that , if the EU will not appoint a special coordinator , I believe Parliament should appoint a rapporteur for Tibet .
if it does not succeed in creating a solid foundation for use it could be that these new opportunities will not be used as they could be because people will be concerned if we do not succeed in establishing a reliable basis for use .
is the European Union itself a champion in all these fields , taking into account , for example , the situation of the media in Italy and Hungary , mass statelessness in Latvia and Estonia and the suspicion of corruption in our Parliament ?
if the European Union wants to deliver a credible , serious and speedy response to the menaces of terrorism , drug use , people-trafficking , illegal immigration and corruption , we need more money and more of the European Union .
one point presents a problem and seems to be meeting with stiff opposition from the Council and the Commission , as you have just said , Commissioner ; it is the question of extending the scope to all mining and waste processing activities using dangerous substances .
I made it clear that our position on Hamas has not changed , but I made it clear that we support ways in which President Abbas can bring unity with Palestinians with his technocratic government and with elections , which is going to be so important .
unfortunately , the trade dossier appears to be completely blocked , so starting to pull out troops is a difficult , but clever , gesture to build up public support in the south and in the north , to show that the prospect of a permanent settlement is actually genuine .
could he try to ensure that there is renewed interest in this particular issue , because it seems to be becoming a more common practice ?
I think that the Charter of Human Rights should be given priority , but it is a good idea to measure everything we do against both of these charters .
but the handover of power from Fidel Castro to his brother , Raúl , has led neither to democratic reforms , nor to the release of political prisoners .
I hope not .
there is still a great deal of cause for concern there , though , for the pace of economic development in South Africa is slackening , as a result of which the fight against poverty , which is to reduce the deprivation suffered by the black and coloured populations owing to years of apartheid , is not making nearly enough progress .
we managed to get the deadlines for authorisation reduced ; it is still possible for supervisory authorities to delegate ; and the position will be reviewed after five years .
as a result , no real barriers to the provision of services in the EU will be removed when this Services Directive is adopted .
first of all , current rules relating to the admission of third-country workers apparently differ from one Member State to another .
the origin was , therefore , a financial crisis in the private sector of the financial system , which rapidly became something that was affecting the real economy in the form of a deep depression , which , technically speaking , was a deep recession .
if we are to take this legislative report on Thursday afternoon , it would probably not be advisable to vote on it at the same time , and hence my request that the debate be scheduled either on Thursday morning or on Wednesday evening , since there are windows left on both days .
the Commission must organize efficient aid , and the process must be speeded up . That point has also been mentioned already .
these agreements are important ; they allow us to ensure the traceability of timber .
it is therefore not correct to establish these vacancies but we should wait , in accordance with the French Constitution , for them to decide , i.e. for thirty days .
Mr President , I am not going to repeat what the previous speakers have said about the need for this directive .
the people of Croatia do not deserve to be ostracised in any way .
if , after all this , the European Union launches infringement proceedings against the current Hungarian Government and state , it will finally open the eyes of those who have ever had any illusions concerning the European Union &apos;s attitude towards Hungary , and I believe that the Hungarian nation will demand our secession from the European Union , and there will be some who will follow our example .
the debate is closed .
27 . Quota system in relation to the production of potato starch ( vote )
the Commission proposal already lays down appropriate derogations for this , and it is essential that these be retained until there is a suitable substitute .
the position varies from one Member State to another and is a matter of subsidiarity , and we in this Parliament have no say whatever in the matter .
there is in fact a paradox in Tunisia .
there are a wide range of scenarios , ranging from abandoning all reform to asking the French and Dutch to vote again .
we also need a fair deal for farmers in the food chain to be able to take on the power of the multiples .
the aim is to draw up best practices , which sovereign wealth funds would be free to adopt , particularly as regards transparency , investment strategies and governance .
this European Parliament is right in our Amendment No 13 to support the holistic approach and for the development of comparable targets , which I will refer to in a moment and which I call on all in this Parliament to support .
this is why investing in people and modernising labour markets remains one of the four priority areas for the new Lisbon cycle .
we wanted to make it easier for SMEs to have access to research programmes , and we have achieved that .
this should give critics of the common agricultural policy pause for thought .
the CE marking would be its lowest level , with a standard mark being required to indicate significant improvements in quality , practical usefulness , or safety features in comparison with the normal CE marking .
finally , I wish to draw your attention to the situation of young people in rural areas .
to conclude this answer , I would like to say that the facts show , in particular for European economies , that market integration , globalisation and liberalisation of trade are beneficial to our economies and bring many more benefits than disadvantages or problems .
Mr President , I would like to make two comments .
this could encourage businesses to relocate to other latitudes .
how will the Community Action for Border Regions be continued ?
I do not think that there should be room for any flexibility here , and nor do I see how anyone , regardless of the type of contract they have - whether they are a franchise-holder or an independent trader or whatever - can suddenly be exempted from these minimum requirements , which concern their own and other people &apos;s safety .
3 . The derogations will allow countries that so wish to postpone the entry into force of this regulation until 2021 !
firstly , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on a very good approach to this issue and to say that the Socialist Group broadly agrees with the matters he has raised .
( DE ) Mr President , the current Cohesion policy started life with the title of the Lisbon Strategy .
Slovenian membership of the euro is a real sign that the dynamism of European integration remains strong .
we are working on a very tight timescale on this legislation , which is due to come into effect on 1 September .
promoting policies in support of abortion does not help to achieve the MDGs .
nevertheless , during the implementation of the Services Directive in Sweden , a debate arose as to whether or not it is permissible to lay down a requirement for there to be a competent representative of the company .
I have always assumed that this was the minimum , which is why I have always been generous in my interpretation of this provision . It means that Mr Sumberg , to my regret , is now the last Member to be called .
the conduct exhibited by these two countries , coupled with their enormous growth , pace and rhythm , must be continued in the near future as well .
European-level supervision of export credits should only be introduced as an exception when some distortion of competition within the Internal Market could occur .
on the remaining amendments tabled by the Committee on Transport and Tourism , which do not fall as part of a precise theme , I have to say that Amendment No 4 does not lead to any specific legal provision in this directive and must therefore be rejected ; whilst Amendments Nos 8 , 10 and 23 can be accepted .
all the political parties in Georgia - both government and opposition - must do everything within their power to improve the atmosphere in the run-up to the elections and to establish a truly democratic political culture .
the Commission &apos;s strategy is set out in detail in the communication on relations with the south Caucasian states of 6 June 1999 which was endorsed by the General Affairs Council in June 1999 .
I am going to be so unwise as to allow one or two personal reflections to creep into my remarks .
thank you very much for all your work !
in around 80 of these cases , Member States indicated that they have been inspired by measures from other Member States in the development of their own policies .
finally , I share the many reservations that have been voiced regarding the agencies , although my reservations only relate to a small number of them .
I feel reassured and confident now that I have read the negotiation documents that we have received .
this report by Mr Brejc is a good example of successful cooperation between Members of this House across party boundaries , and a model to follow as regards successful cooperation with the Council under our codecision arrangements .
Mr Newton Dunn chose the first pillar whereas we were of the opinion that the procedure should be left in the third pillar . The reason for this is that in the third pillar the group of offenders who are guilty of counterfeiting travel documents is more wide-ranging than in the first pillar where Mr Newton Dunn had established it , where the focus is exclusively on the tracking of the counterfeiting of documents for illegal immigrants .
( CS ) I welcome the submission of the Green Paper on the reform of the common fisheries policy .
I , too , have felt that victims have been somewhat absent .
everyone knows the true picture !
since a number of major companies withdrew from Burma under pressure from protests in their home lands , things have been quiet ; the regime accepts the low standard of living and the criticism from outside as inevitable , without making any changes .
hundreds of people have been involved in the reform : Commission officials , MEPs , and staff of the Court of Auditors and the Council .
however , I am highly critical of large sections of the report and consequently cannot vote in favour .
it would create the wrong impression if Turkey were to be given EU funding and allowed to participate in various EU programmes before there is any clear indication of how it intends to tackle the Kurdish question .
so not only was there no opposition , but it was even necessary to resort to fraud in order to obtain the figure of 51 % .
on a global level , progress is being made and we are learning lessons from this - lessons that were established in the initiatives of the International Monetary Fund , the OECD , the G20 , and the Financial Stability Forum .
however , we also need to promote sustainable gear and sustainable fishing , which means that we have to make progress on the definition of small-scale fishing , which is something that undoubtedly needs greater clarification .
I should therefore like to address in particular all those who have worked on the European project , who are members of the European Parliament , and say to them once again : You can be proud of the work accomplished by the European Parliament .
the origin of the proposal lies in a decade of jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice , which ruled that patients have the right to be reimbursed for health care received abroad , even if they could have received that health care at home .
the rest takes place by legislation .
as you are aware , where there is uncertainty as to the correct legal basis , every committee of Parliament has so far had to seek the opinion of the Legal Affairs Committee .
although there are a few exceptions , most Member States refuse to set quantitative targets which would be easy to monitor .
the European Commission has not been idle in responding to this situation .
( RO ) The European Commission has declared 2009 as the European Year of Creativity and Innovation .
I see them as not only a bilateral problem ; they continue to be applicable in law , and the question therefore arises of whether they are compatible with Article 6 of the Treaty of Amsterdam .
consequently , it appears that you consulted your conscience , and believed that we were all wrong when we voted in the resolution on research for the 21st century .
however , it is important to remember - and there were others in this House prior to my time - what your predecessor Mr Fischler said when reforming the CAP in 2003 .
what I want to say to the Commission representative and to you , as our representative here , is that if this proposal does not go to conciliation in which the view of Parliament is heard , including the views of those Member States who were not members of the Union when this proposal first came forward , then we make a mockery of our right to be consulted and to be absorbed into this discussion .
a full listing of the Commission ’ s position on each of the amendments is being made available to Parliament ( 1 ) .
as you know , the work during the Presidency will focus on the international negotiation process .
we are politically rudderless in Europe and the real crisis in Europe is the lack of political leadership .
there are , in South America , certain outermost regions that form an integral part of the European Union and are , by that token , eligible for specific policies .
( DE ) Madam President , my fellow member Joost Lagendijk is in the same situation as Kosovo .
a good start to improving results is the fact that last year there were fewer budget funds left unspent by the Commission than there had been for years .
the third issue that I would like to emphasise is that I am worried that we use only risky models as a basis .
this is wrong for several reasons .
- ( PL ) Madam President , we are witnessing serious events taking place in the field of international politics .
there is one thing that is of interest to the United States ; there is the other which is of interest to us .
the uprising in this country , following on from Tunisia and Egypt , has been bloodier and has taken a tragic turn .
despite that , however , we now need to examine things calmly and remember that you cannot generalise on the basis of an individual case .
that is where the debate on Mr Buffetaut &apos;s report must begin .
my Group , as you know and as Barón Crespo has just said , has some reservations on particular points .
Mr Giansily , the decision will be taken next year by the Heads of State and of government , at the end of April , or the beginning of May 1998 .
the Amsterdam Treaty gives you the opportunity to intervene if there are problems with the work of individual Commissioners .
if governments had carried out some sort of objective analysis of what threatened not only their own countries but the planet and the whole of humanity and had prepared themselves for these threats , then warning systems would have been in place and the emergency work would have been better planned .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the enlargement of the European Union is an endeavour - an endeavour for 500 million people on this continent , people in the EU &apos;s fifteen Member States , but also in the countries that want to join them in it .
nevertheless , it contains many good things .
the Council &apos;s common position represents a good compromise ; we need to keep to it and not give in to &quot; liberalism at any price &apos; .
the debate is closed .
the June List is voting against this report , as taxation must be decided nationally and sovereignly by the Member States .
as Mrs Andrikiencannot be present this evening to present her report on the development of the UN Human Rights Council and the role of the EU , there will be a vote on this report on Wednesday , as scheduled , without a general discussion .
if we were to now monitor and investigate that there would be a good deal of money to be saved in this area , too .
on the subject of human rights in Russia , there is indeed a serious problem , which we acknowledge , and the resolution which we are submitting is sufficiently tough and incisive .
as they deal with the same subject , Question Nos 2 and 3 will be taken together .
the EU has been very supportive of the peace process in Guatemala , both politically and financially .
approval of the Minutes
why do 250 million children have to work to survive ?
I fully agree with the conclusions reached by Mr Turchi .
it was therefore decided that , before reducing the limits once again , it was first of all necessary to develop a new test cycle and bring the driving conditions for the noise test closer in line with real-life driving operations .
we are moving ahead on the issue of visa facilitation .
of course it is of a temporary nature .
we might not like the current pillar-based structure , but , while it exists - and this is the structure that exists - this is the framework in which we must work - and work responsibly .
8 . Women in Turkey ( vote )
( the House rose and observed a minute &apos;s silence )
sixty-five years ago , on 10 October 1941 , the people of Luxembourg had to take part in a referendum organised by the Nazi occupiers , for which they were asked to specify their race , ethnicity and language .
if it is not effective , we will abolish it ; if it is only partially effective and appropriate , it will have to be modified accordingly .
I would ask that we concentrate on what we are due to vote on , which is to say Mr Casaca &apos;s report .
the circumstances of copyright distribution companies still vary considerably in the various countries , which have very different statuses , and , from this perspective , harmonisation is not ready to be carried out in practice .
regular renewals , even so-called administrative renewals of licences , would just push up costs to licence holders without improving road safety in the slightest way .
I still do not understand how the Council can be against approving and increasing transparency in limits on times when loaded lorries can use European motorways at weekends . Fortunately , we only have three months left of the German Presidency , after which we can assume that such approval will be granted .
the third thing I want to mention is the reference in the comments to the Directive concerning harbour facilities for receiving waste from ships .
the most pleasing aspect of our negotiations with the Council , however , is that repeated bad behaviour will be punished .
you even went beyond this debate , mentioning a number of challenges facing the Commission and the European Union : expansion , consolidation of growth , sustainable development .
I believe that Europe has always made progress on the basis of consensus .
the Central Asian countries have a strong interest in creating an opportunity to diversify their oil and gas exports .
I can assure you that this information , of which I am now aware , was not passed on to the Commission previously , because the transfer of such financial information falls within the scope of the Data Protection Directive 95 / 46 / EC .
on the voting list : firstly , there was no mention of paragraph 3 ; secondly , I think we should look again at what happened about Amendments 52 and 51 .
we know that the numbers trying to come to our continent are not in fact increasing over time .
are you going to suggest to President Barroso and within the College of Commissioners that a group be formed to work in this field , so that consumers are no longer considered as adjustment variables , as passive individuals , but rather as active participants who are on your side , on our side , so that we can build this future society that we so desperately need ?
it is no exaggeration to say that the accession of ten Member States marks a truly historic moment .
Mr President , following on from what the President-in-Office of the Council said in his introduction I would just repeat that the Commission also shares the concern at the current escalation of events in the Middle East and is more than willing to study where humanitarian aid is needed so that we can contribute in that action .
the fourth group is legal certainty . Mr Evans , legal certainty is , of course - and I am the first to acknowledge this - important for businesses , not just for the legal professions , although the latter do play an extremely important role in the construction of Europe .
I believe Article 137 of the compromise , on review , is important .
my country , Spain , also aspires to achieving real convergence with the European Union average because , according to our political philosophy , the aim is not to create permanently subsidised societies , but that our level of development must contribute to the internal economic balance of the Union .
this means that the recognition of qualifications for professional purposes depends on criteria drawn up by the professions themselves .
any projects that may be reprioritised and delayed in this way will be within the Asia envelope which , if necessary , will have to be readapted .
in these areas payments to final beneficiaries are still affected by material error rates , albeit at varying levels .
in my opinion , this confirms the results of market research showing that consumers are interested in buying more environmentally friendly products .
the fact that we have never before had such prosperity , such high levels of education , social services and health care , and at the same time so much crime , violence and drug addiction , is surely food for thought .
( applause )
we can look further east and see potential danger and potential fracture with what is happening in the Middle East .
if that does not happen then the Commission must act decisively .
if you are saying , Commissioner , that we must start negotiating soon , and if Mrs Pack is saying that we must actually negotiate about status and standards simultaneously , then I have to ask you , what are we in the European Union doing to persuade the Albanian leadership in Kosovo that they really must accept a multi-ethnic state ?
this formed part of the sustainable development strategy for the outermost regions proposed by the Commission in order to pursue one of its priority action areas , namely bringing these regions into their own regional environment .
the sector is facing serious challenges , however .
if heads are made to roll , it does not mean that reforms can actually take place , but without these reforms - which have been announced , and which I hope will not remain simply announcements , and Parliament will be monitoring this very closely - there can be no further development of the European Union .
finally , it is also important that , in preparing the analysis to which the President-in-Office of the Council referred , there should be real consideration of the various factors involved .
as the number of candidates does not exceed the number of vacancies , I propose that they be elected by acclamation in accordance with Rule 12 ( 1 ) of the Rules of Procedure , albeit with their seniority then being determined by an electronic vote .
in our western society , cost control almost inevitably means job losses .
that is what it says in the Treaty .
although we are not , of course , capable of absorbing them , let us be up to the task of &apos; integrating &apos; them into our area , in a new , broader definition of the term .
this does not mean , however , that there can now be complete harmonisation of fuel taxation even if this is spread over time .
as explained in my speech to the plenary I support the enlargement process and wish to see the applicant countries as part of the EU .
the Turkey debate is the first real debate on enlargement , for nobody – irrespective of how they are voting – is describing the accession of Poland , the Czech Republic or Hungary as an enlargement of the European idea ; they were a matter of obligation , for it was right and proper to welcome these countries after the collapse of Communism .
should not the mention in the Fourçans report - that it is necessary to anticipate situations in which the Member States might suffer asymmetric or symmetric crises - be reflected in some points in a resolution ?
the behaviour of China , which had made promises , for example to open up the insurance market , has not been very encouraging in recent years .
an incentive for this is , for example , that the way in which doctors ’ working hours are interpreted causes huge problems for the Member States , and for this reason too it is very important to find a solution for this directive .
the main reason why they do so is that the old directive is unworkable and , in environmental terms , pre-historic .
I should like , where this year ’ s budget is concerned , to emphasise that , in connection with enlargement , we have appropriated more money to guarantees for loans .
the situation of both the media and the various NGOs , and also that of the very popular Islamic figure Obidkhon Nazarov is regarded as extremely unsatisfactory and was the subject of a very negative assessment in the last Human Rights Watch report .
in a sense too , it is a response to the Varela Project .
we thus support the six amendments proposed by the rapporteur , insofar as it seems to us necessary to notify the relevant authorities regarding the introduction of all new products onto the market as this thus enables some form of product monitoring , and also necessary to fight against pirating and copying of products or medical procedures , thus giving a guarantee of quality and safety to the users .
we have heard about all manner of improvements and it is true that the dictatorship has indeed implemented some improvements and has made a number of promises .
but I will do what I can to see that Mrs Theato &apos; s report receives more support .
you have committed yourself in this regard and , above all , you have once again committed yourself to the five points .
( PL ) Madam President , in 2001 the Vice-President of the Beijing Organising Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad , Liu Jingmin , stated that awarding the Olympic Games to Beijing would help to promote the development of human rights .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - ( PL ) Mr President , the subject of today &apos;s debate is breaches of human rights in Chad .
the Finnish Presidency is deserving of praise here too , for it initiated the idea of sending a delegation on behalf of the European Union .
twenty thousand three hundred and fifty-five euros each for twenty-seven million families .
Mr Duff , you are not allowed to make any comments regarding the content .
thus , I was in Luxembourg last week and I shall be in Slovenia this week , to carry out this check with its officials , whom I need in order to ensure that the internal market functions properly .
the government launched the operation as a result of this pressure and the failure to deal with the situation by introducing new laws and tightening up on the existing ones .
I decided to suggest 1 December 2010 as an acceptable compromise , in accordance with Parliament &apos;s resolution of last year .
let us just remind ourselves that banks are not risk free .
the Union has proved that it can show the solidarity expected of it and which we work to achieve .
these groups are always protected by legislation which is lax from environmental , commercial and fiscal points of view , and Gibraltar is no exception .
the State &apos;s decision , then , has to be taken within a brief period ( within four months from the making of the application ) and must be supported by a statement of reasons .
the judgment in Luxembourg clearly brought out this directive &apos;s weaknesses , and it is regrettable that the Commission has to lag behind on this point .
the people of Ireland , which was the only nation to be consulted by referendum , were not mistaken in rejecting the Treaty of Nice .
back in March 1998 the IMF and the World Bank outlined a macro-economic programme for Bosnia-Herzegovina .
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned .
it is curious that very large sums , fortunes in fact , have been invested in all kinds of projects , but that apparently there were no interim criteria to verify the usefulness of these investments , or in any case afterwards , and that no investigations were made either into whether the subsidized projects and organizations were also supported by third parties , for example the Member States , independently .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we are discussing three reports , or to be more precise , three legislative proposals that aim to improve road safety and guarantee better a smoother operation of the internal market .
it is always good to know what we are actually talking about .
turning to the issue of individual guidelines , I can assure you that the Commission is in favour of stepping up the EU ’ s involvement in matters such as partnerships , equality between men and women , the problems experienced by young people and job creation .
while the Commission should monitor the various scientific opinions , it is not sufficient to automatically accept this type of proposal with serious repercussions of many kinds – social , most importantly : we must call for the presentation of compensatory measures to prevent traumatic situations in the regions dependent on fisheries , for fishermen and for their families .
 
continuation of development aid will be possible only if all foreign troops leave the country .
one of the fundamental reasons for the tabling of the motion of censure was to decide now , immediately , whether or not the European Commission is to be able to do its work .
fourthly , I also agree with other speakers that we must attach importance to strategic development factors : lifelong education and support for small businesses .
Commissioner , you can count on my support , and , I hope , that of Parliament .
seven key challenges with goals and measures have now been clearly set out in the strategy , and this will enable the European Union to confirm even more clearly our role as a frontrunner in international cases .
the European Union is Tajikistan &apos;s primary trading partner .
let us not make the mistake of taking the disaster that befell the introduction of German lorry tolls as a reason not to give toll charging by satellite a chance .
they told me that the best you can do is to speak Greek , they will listen to you , but the debate will take place in Russian and English , which means that I would not understand anything because I am not as fortunate as you in knowing all these languages .
thank you , Commissioner Fischler .
the package borrows cleverly from the Swiss model of the system of government and the Belgian model for European relations .
this is a Treaty that is unloved , unwanted and , most importantly , ineffective , and this Parliament should recognise the fact .
this year it is the opposite .
these are the critical yardsticks , since a fully functioning justice system underpins the functioning of the whole of society and the economy in its entirety .
it was indeed chaos - Mr Simpson has already said that .
the negative micro-management spiral has to be avoided and the common fisheries policy needs to be fundamentally altered , as the discard issue seriously discredits it .
they are guidelines and they have strenuously resisted what so often happens if people try to turn the guidelines into some sort of advance and premature first reading .
the same applies to refugee policy .
( FR ) Mr President , Mrs Ashton , the death and disappearance of the body of Seyed Ali Mousavi , the nephew of the leader of the Iranian opposition , is one of many tragic examples that show the current malaise of the Islamic Republic of Iran .
the question was asked what will the ECB do if that creates problems for Denmark ?
that is why I am very much in favour of the best available technology being used .
the other point I would highly commend her for is the incorporation in paragraph 9 of her report of the response to the challenge laid down by Commissioner Liikanen some two years ago about the policies of critical mass .
it is the time to promote a common foreign and defence policy . There is a paradox here in that Mr Elles said we need to strengthen the common foreign and defence policy while at the same time suggesting we make certain concessions to the United States .
most of the hurdles are still to come .
in writing . - With this vote , the EP refuses to grant the Director of the European Police College discharge in respect of the implementation of the College &apos;s budget for the financial year 2008 .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , Madam High Representative , on behalf of my group , I would like to start by saying that we could not agree more with your introduction , with the aims you have put forward , and with the efforts you are making to re-instil life into what you yourself called the &apos; stalled &apos; peace process .
for this reason , we can only deplore the fact that the student demonstrations have been blocked totally unacceptably with police intervention by the Serbian Government .
when the ten new Member States joined in 2004 , we welcomed their membership for various reasons , not least because those countries in central and eastern Europe had marked a major milestone in their remarkably short transition from the horrors they had experienced under communism to democracy .
we agree with the Council that it is not right simply and solely to criticise Turkey .
B5-0636 / 2001 by Mr Segni , on behalf of the UEN Group ;
both President Barroso and the Vice-President of the Commission and EU High Representative , Cathy Ashton , have welcomed the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to Liu Xiaobo on 8 October .
this is the objective we want to pursue , so this mixed approach is precisely the right one .
some of them believe , moreover , that the nuclear sector should simply not be developed .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Europe has to decide : does it want regulated immigration or the invasion and criminal exploitation of illegal immigrants ?
the foreign minister , Mr Frank-Walter Steinmeier , who formerly coordinated Germany &apos;s secret services , should desist from deceiving the public and at last face up to his responsibility for what happened back then .
then , taking into account of what had happened on both sides , I thought that the physical assault was the more serious , and accordingly gave a formal warning .
nuclear proliferation is more or less under control , although we have been going through a very difficult phase since the signing of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1968 , which then came into force in 1970 .
innovation is the link in the chain between research , development and production , and it is where Europe is not strong enough .
however , the compromise that has now emerged , according to which the Commission can intervene in matters of competition law , and in particular in matters of market definition and with regard to what constitutes significant market power , is , I believe , a very fair one .
Mr President , as I listened to the President of the European Council , I heard a different tone to that of the President of the Commission .
I will dwell on a few specific topics .
in my view , this is a very important step in relation to the role of agriculture and supports and the impact it has on developing countries .
this is an honest report , conducted after an extensive inquiry .
composition of committees : see Minutes
it was interesting to note the Commission &apos;s repeated assurances that it would issue a communication in May , possibly devoted exclusively to payment systems .
in addition , with the support of the Commission , we are organizing a presidency conference on local development initiatives in Dublin in November during our presidency .
I think that reference is very relevant .
finally , should such a threshold also apply to genetically engineered plants that produce substances like pharmaceuticals ?
I will now turn to financial supervision .
industrial restructuring and mergers
since we have seen how those events have led to the danger of misunderstanding between civilisations , the message which you are to address to the Europeans today is of universal and particularly topical importance .
finally , I would mention that in 2012 , we want to produce a blueprint on waters and their management .
the IPCC &apos;s Fourth Assessment Report states quite clearly that no region of Europe will be spared its effects .
we were challenged by the Commission and by the Council to get this directive through as quickly as possible .
whilst respecting the convictions of others , we must walk into the future in a peaceful manner .
if we are to achieve salmonella control across the whole of Europe , we need salmonella-free areas , wherever they may be , to be able to protect themselves while others catch up .
the removal of sanctions is something which would accompany the gradual re-establishment of confidence .
Mr Barroso , to see the end before beginning and to see what cannot be seen , is an ability which , in politics , is not within everybody ’ s reach .
I myself read his works before I started dealing with monetary policy .
after that has taken place perhaps I can further inform Parliament , but at this moment I see no reason to change the opinion that I have just given .
allowing Britain ’ s contribution to rise from an average of GBP 3 billion net to more than GBP 6 billion per annum from 2007 is totally unacceptable and squanders Mrs Thatcher ’ s hard-earned rebate .
I can see at least three .
to be on the safe side , I recently paid a working visit to the only nuclear power plant which my country boasts .
it had the widest possible support in the Committee on Foreign Affairs , and I regret that the GUE / NGL Group has chosen to re-table amendments that were rejected by the committee .
my services have already held a meeting for instance with the office of President Mahmoud Abbas to discuss implementing some of those projects , for instance through the office of the President .
in that respect , Regulation No 2078 / 92 makes a very important contribution to the stabilisation of rural areas .
Finland has a lot to teach us , particularly in relation to the importance of investment in high-quality education and also how to balance economic efficiency and social justice .
because the fact is that protectionism - I am sorry to have to tell Mr Caudron , although free trade is a Liberal concept - merely leads to the protected industry becoming weaker and less competitive , so that it has to confine itself to its home market . And if that market is one day opened up , the industry can no longer compete with its rivals .
so do you see a time frame there for that to be successful ?
once again , it is an intergovernmental mechanism which was concocted within Ecofin and which requires unanimity .
given that a well-functioning legal regulation mechanism is already in force in this area in the European Union , I do not endorse this resolution on policy options for progress towards a European contract law for consumers and businesses , which proposes adopting a new regulation , which would set up a new optional instrument , to be applied in business-to-business and business-to-consumer transactions .
you are the only person who ever decided , when President-in-Office of the Council , to enter an election campaign by founding , in a fit of megalomania which finds no parallel in the history of western democracy , a party which bears your own name .
it is a first step towards fuller integration of environmental considerations into product design and consumption patterns .
there is total intolerance of criticism and we are not allowed to object or express our views .
it was the first time ever that the multilateral aspect had been addressed directly .
Mr President , I will not keep you long .
there are , however , two specific issues that I would like to raise .
it should be noted that this Network has been important and effective .
. Mr President , today is an important day .
I would like to congratulate the Commissioner on his appointment .
urgent action must be taken against criminal organisations , they should be brought to justice , and torture camps should be permanently closed .
the recent call by President Rajapakse for an international independent commission – which we support – is a positive step which will have to be followed up by concrete action .
so definitive decisions about the sector were taken mainly at a political level , while dangerous disregard was shown for the role and contribution of relevant international bodies such as the International Telecommunications Association and the European Conference of Post Offices and Telecommunications , in the development of telecommunications and the necessary international cooperation .
quite simply , the way the noise and the stench of cars remains trapped in the valleys is quite different from conditions on flat ground .
Mr President , I welcome this report on Parliament &apos;s budget guidelines and I welcome the discussion on what our priorities are to ensure that Parliament can do its job .
they have now nominated a security coordinator for the area to help address future incidents .
in reply to Ms Flasarová , we cannot prevent companies from delocalising , but we have instruments to tackle that issue .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the following quote from a recently published book on tele-translation goes to the heart of the proposal before us .
nor is the fact that the European Parliament has opened a Liaison Office with the US Congress business as usual .
the Union must not be content with being ambitious .
as an MEP from a new Member State , I am particularly pleased that the concept of solidarity also features in the new energy chapter .
the compulsory licensing issue thus remains on the agenda of the WTO .
it is said that the Chadian soil reeks of petroleum .
and finally , we need priority cofinancing from the Commission to buy emergency means of transport to provide fast links between islands and other islands or mainland areas in the event of an emergency .
the regime is politically authoritarian , yet has a liberal attitude to the economy , religion and customs .
to insist that Turkey could accede to the European Union in spite of its lack of democracy , which indeed exists .
the fact is that we cannot expect the Member States to effectively secure funding and fulfil their obligations and rights if the procedures are not simplified .
we need to lay down practical measures , and here we have come up with a new trick : we now no longer say 0.01 or whatever , but demand BAT , best available technique .
and then , let us not do everything in a hurry and let us not disappear after the elections .
the next speaker on the list is Mr Martin Schulz , from whom I have received a letter .
this principle was established by the Copenhagen European Council as far back as 1993 , and therefore constitutes one of the pillars of the so-called Copenhagen
all births should be officially registered regardless of gender .
in addition , we have established contact with several NGOs and associations , but we feel that care must be taken not to overload these organisations with funds and assistance , which may not subsequently be managed in the most efficient way possible .
in my view the Council common position , as the President has said , and no matter how defective it may be because of failure to consult the committee , is now with the Committee on Transport , and that committee is not meeting this week .
we therefore need the powerful forces within our Member States to come together , we need genuine action from those who support fishing , to call for the Council to condemn unequivocally , on 11 June , the new CFP proposed by Mr Fischler and to demand an ambitious plan in its place .
the PPE Group will be particularly vigilant regarding the application of these conventions in the Member States .
nonetheless , we believe that individual Member States are best placed to respond rapidly and appropriately to disasters occurring within their own territory .
Mr Prodi , I address you in my capacity as President of this Parliament &apos; s Committee on Fisheries .
the authorities have taken a number of measures concerning the official use of minority languages and scripts as well as the representation of minorities in the judiciary and police .
the ERDF supports numerous programmes which could significantly improve and do improve the living conditions of the Roma , who are Europe &apos;s largest and most excluded minority , while not forgetting other groups who are in similar social and economic conditions .
this proposal should meet with the approval of the various Member States , and the Commission will keep you informed .
my initiatives and overtures over the years to engage the Chinese leadership in a dialogue remain unreciprocated .
we understand their outrage , but diplomacy offers the best chance to address the immediate priority , not the destruction of essential infrastructure , the detention of members of the Palestinian Legislative Council or the shelling of the Prime Minister ’ s office .
if so - and I will end here , Mr President - when would the deadline be ?
is it an appropriate and adequate response to the political engagement by the Council in April 2004 to assist the development of North Cyprus ?
this would create a connection between Europe and the people of Europe .
European City Guide is a problem which is repeatedly coming up on my desk and your desk and yet nobody does anything .
the next item is Cambodia , specifically the case of Sam Rainsy .
because there is a huge civil society in Iran that certainly would like to have a different way of life , but there is still a very difficult regime .
I would like to comment briefly on the most controversial points : regarding the ceiling for electoral observation missions , I would have hoped for a stronger commitment from the Commission and the Council than an attached statement , but I hope that , after the comments made in this Chamber , this ceiling will be strictly respected .
our resolution indicates the need for short- and long-term emissions objectives .
policy based on the diplomatic means which have been used until now should produce an international understanding guaranteeing a fair division of potential territorial acquisitions .
these mainly concern criticisms directed against the agreement on the question of failings in establishing minimum rules and failings in the scope of the agreement and on the question of what can be regarded as objective criteria .
you ask for the rules to be changed on the financial regulation .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , religious freedom is the basis of civilisation .
Parliament must reconfirm its position at first reading without entering into individual amendments at this stage .
the European Union has great responsibilities and we must continue to work in that direction .
the question of funding for the organization that is mentioned in the question is a matter for the Commission and not a matter for the Council .
in this respect , increasing expertise is not a goal in itself , but translating expertise into innovation and industrial success , however , is .
for that , political will , decisiveness and courage must not fail us ; on the contrary .
our policies will need public support , so our policymaking will need proper democratic oversight and control .
we all know where there are huge amounts of money from which savings can be made .
the budgetary cost arising from expansion towards Eastern Europe is negligible in comparison with the economic and political gains for those countries , as well as for us .
education and culture will be the bridge joining the different experiences of the European Union &apos;s Member States and that will help to regain Europe &apos;s leading role in the world in the realms of science and culture .
I very much regret that the Council is not present for this debate .
he explained the situation in Iran to me very clearly , and so I am very pleased that people there are trying to go back to the democracy that the Shah had installed into the country , even though he was the emperor .
that is the way to proceed .
over four million still suffer significant injuries at work each year .
not at all .
to ensure the cohesion policy leads to positive results , let us allow the regions to participate actively ; let us allow them to feel ownership of the process , give them appropriate resources and make sure they use them in the most efficient way .
President-in-Office , you said that the scope of the EU ’ s powers is limited , which I accept .
as my colleague pointed out , we clearly said that if Moldova really wants to get closer to the European Union then it is very important for it to also demonstrate that interest .
this cannot be done without joining forces with NATO as the latter has all the necessary resources available .
in that case , we could be talking about a toy crisis , as toys not complying with safety requirements are known to be sold , as well as a whole range of other unsafe products .
Madam President , thank you for the generosity with which you are directing this meeting and the place that you have granted me in it .
I wish to thank the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs , and particularly its chairman , Hedy d &apos;Ancona , for accepting my amendment calling for appropriate facilities to be provided for pregnant women in prisons .
the Dutch Parliament will not discuss further measures against female genital mutilation until later on this month .
if we ask any smuggler of Marlboro cigarettes what difference he sees between the market in Detroit and our own internal market - and such surveys in depth have been carried out by our committee - he would answer that the only difference perhaps is that in America he pays some taxes , while in Europe he pays no tax at all .
that will be more disruptive than receiving such messages on your PC .
( PL ) Mr President , President-in-Office of the Council , President of the Commission , I agree with the President-in-Office .
where preventive measures are concerned , the Commission responded directly in the shape of my fellow Commissioner , Mrs De Palacio and , on 21 March , adopted a communication concerning safety when transporting oil at sea .
that means that when the next Congress is elected it will be vitally important for all of us , but obviously most particularly for members of other legislatures , to establish early contact with the members of that Congress .
the economic crisis magnifies these disparities , placing additional pressures on the governments in these countries , which have to deal with stringent macroeconomic conditions , the social repercussions of the crisis , while also having to resolve problems arising from the vulnerability of the financial system and the sustainability of the public health care and social insurance systems .
even today , the French army maintains a presence in Côte d ’ Ivoire to protect , not the people , but French capitalist interests .
the joint debate is closed . We shall now proceed to the vote on the motions for resolutions . ( 1 )
as regards the choice of service providers , I think the major airlines should not be discriminated against : they must also have fair market-access opportunities .
in fact , the Lamassoure report &apos;s sole merit is that it brings into the cold light of day the contradictions of present-day Europe .
that means that in situ checks on farms will primarily be the task of the Member States and the Commission departments will be responsible for ensuring and verifying whether the Member States are indeed adequately fulfilling this obligation .
the old Member States that joined forces against this directive have caused a recrudescence of combative jargon .
in my four minutes this morning , I do not have time to go through all the points and all the improvements that we have made in great detail .
I am particularly thinking about doctors .
subject : Ethnic minorities in Serbia
I voted in favour because I feel it is crucial and increasingly urgent that we find solutions whereby we can overcome the problems and challenges facing the EU , both internally and externally .
with regard to the third proposal on persons and groups associated with Osama bin Laden , the al-Qaeda network or the Taliban , the idea that this comes under the Union &apos;s external actions is untenable , as Mr Luhan has just stated .
I was pleased to hear so many of you use the words &apos; acting together &apos; and &apos; acting in partnership &apos; .
I welcome the creation of this directive , which will guarantee SGIs as one of the main pillars of the European social model .
these political deficits have been eliminated , and no one - either in Slovakia or outside it - would understand , if there were not now a suitably positive response from the European Union .
( ES ) Mr President , I would first like to clarify that I am in favour of strengthening trade links between the European Union and Papua New Guinea that promote the development of the region , but it must be sustainable development .
it was hoped that the G8 Summit , which we in Scotland hosted , would take some brave steps towards providing an ongoing framework , perhaps giving the Commission a lead for ongoing , coherent , constructive engagement with countries like Niger .
there are other distinguished and courageous Turkish Cypriots whose voices need to be heard .
please believe me when I say that they are also personal .
the European Parliament has been called upon for some time to take a position on the texts relating to the operation of the WTO .
they can be used as alibis to legitimise a regime which has gained power via unlawful means .
Mr Bukovsky is quite right , the EU is a form of soft communism .
( 1 )
it was also due to the EU &apos;s work that a large number of partnerships between the public and private sectors were agreed on , specifically in the field of water and energy and that a ten-year plan was adopted for sustainable production and consumption .
I think that it is time for Mr Marty to say whether that list of names can be deleted , especially as two of our colleagues are on the list .
the Committee on Fisheries has clearly defined the contents and affirmed their importance .
do we currently have the ability to check for computerised rigging in election observation missions ?
but although transparency appears to be respected , there is creeping censorship at various stages of parliamentary work .
in writing . - ( PL ) When it voted for compulsory unbundling of ownership of energy concerns in the European Union , the European Parliament took a decisive step towards creating a common market in electrical energy .
we also appeal for a change in lifestyle patterns .
through the printing press , citizens were given entirely new ways of obtaining new and much more easily accessible information .
does this change affect the whole of the day &apos;s agenda , or just part of it , and who decided on the change ?
a free vote in Parliament is not always the best solution in this connection .
we need to re-balance the European monetary union , achieve greater transparency and more effective management of the crisis in the financial markets and rebuild public trust from the bottom .
lastly , we should emphasise the need for a &apos; New Attitude &apos; with respect to the elderly , seeing them as an important new resource that should be cherished - not as a burden on society .
the European Commission , which has to ensure that Community law is applied , has to maintain special relations with citizens who are witnesses to , or the actual or alleged victims of , violations of Community law and who lodge complaints with its services .
there must be more control of arms flows .
Mrs Ainardi , Mr Jarzembowski , Mr Sterckx and Mr Savary have all done splendid work .
I can assure Mr Bösch that the Commission will carefully examine all recorded progress .
sixthly , the precautionary principle must apply to any discernible risk .
it is especially difficult to define what human rights actually are , and to agree on whether certain things are simply desirable , or are really needed to correct abuses of the fundamental rights and freedoms set out in international conventions .
without going so far as to set the unrealistic objective of total self-sufficiency , the European Union could still reduce its reliance on external suppliers .
Europe &apos;s reunification started with the reunification of the German nation .
at the latest we have to try to forge this post-2012 agreement by the Conference of Parties in 2009 , and quite a transformation in attitudes in these other countries is going to be needed if we are to achieve that .
Mr Lannoye &apos;s report , which I welcome , contains a series of proposals concerning the route which might be followed .
peace in the Middle East can be brought closer through cooperation with the West and technical development . Sustainable peace , however , requires acknowledgement of every human being &apos;s right to life , together with compliance with the peace process that has been entered into .
the second of these issues is the approval of the Financial Perspective .
we want this opportunity to bring substantial changes to our lives in society at large , we want democracy to be synonymous with equality between men and women , and we do not want women to be excluded socially or economically as is still happening today .
we also called on the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Auditors to amend their respective administrative decisions by 1 November of this year in such a way as to rule out the private use of official cars , and there are amendments in the budget for that .
the following week you made the College of Commissioners decide on an issue with hardly any debate .
it is currently a source of deprivation , a source of violence and a source of intolerance , accompanied by other social scourges such as rural exodus and population migration .
the Commission already welcomed this idea at first reading , but , as Amendment No 15 better meets the concerns of the directive , the Commission would prefer it to be adopted rather than Amendment No 9 .
the health card , which must never , I venture to stress , become an obstacle to the movement of persons .
the only thing that has changed is that there is no longer a war going on , but the changes have not been as great as we should have liked .
we have to demonstrate to all interested groups the benefits flowing from that and we must show that trade and other legitimate public policy concerns , for example those relating to the environment , are not mutually incompatible but could instead work to mutual advantage .
I voted in favour because the Schwab report has the merit of protecting consumers in their cross-border purchases .
Slovakia &apos;s political problems continue to be a priority , and dominate other questions which are of importance in the accession process of this country .
the situation has certainly not improved in recent weeks and months .
I was under the impression , from my contacts over the past six months , that that should be feasible , but I am very keen to hear your reaction .
so although I may not share his conclusions , I believe he has illustrated in his report many of the issues which the Commission must address .
once countries are tied by the Treaty &apos;s criteria for EMU , employment and welfare are not exactly set to benefit .
 
unfortunately , the ideologies to which millions of human lives were sacrificed are again taking centre stage .
the Council has been absent from this debate on discharge .
just as we do , you represent the majority of Europe &apos;s citizens , and you can be sure of their support .
above all , we must abandon the grubbing-up scenario and use the crop reconversion levy for those holdings with market difficulties , to achieve high-quality production .
about 500 of the wounded are still in a critical condition and are dying by the day , in addition to a total destruction of over 4 000 homes , buildings , and about 20 000 other homes .
we now have a deadline for when the long-term targets are to be achieved , namely before 2020 , except in cases where it is physically impossible to achieve the targets .
Madam President , the ILO , as colleagues have said , has been around for a long time - since 1919 : 90 years of business and still working on the Decent Work Agenda .
the High Representatives may be part of the mouthpiece of the Council but it is good debate between all three institutions which holds out the best hope for the future .
we should in the future also make sure that we support an Ombudsman who is independent in his decision making .
Madam President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , Agenda 2000 aims to facilitate the eastward enlargement of the EU and to prepare for the next WTO talks .
I hope that our Presidents will be able to present this to the heads of government at the summit .
as I tried to explain before , our approaches are really different , but you can be sure that where possible we are working with Russia on this important issue and trying to do what we can .
it is to be hoped that progress will be made on this , so that everyone will be considered equally in this single permit package .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we should congratulate ourselves on proposals and reports such as this , because it includes the ultraperipheral regions in setting energy guidelines .
Mr President , in the absence of my colleague , Mr Crowley , I wish , at the outset to place on the record of the House his appreciation to the Secretariat of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens &apos; Rights for all its assistance and advice in preparing this second SLIM report and also , to thank the other draftsmen for their additions to the text .
as these two first historical resources are the only ones specifically belonging to the Community and able to make it financially independent of the Member States , their decline means the Community budget depends on payments from the Member States .
it is very important that today we have this possibility and , of course , we should not hand out money for a Member State to breach environmental legislation .
one thing at least emerges clearly from the results of the elections held in the Spanish Basque region : the Basque people , who turned out in force to cast their votes , have rejected violence .
as a matter of fact , I find the adopted definition of ‘ politically exposed persons ’ surprisingly loose .
more families have been bereaved and more victims have been added to the tragic pages of the Middle East conflict .
Poland has not , and will not be able to resolve this situation until the European Union applies equal market protection rules for all Member States .
we know quite well what is possible on the environment within the WTO .
then we have the accompanying US side letter which says that they will interpret the agreement as laid down by President Bush &apos;s executive decrees on data sharing and access by other agencies .
the intention is clearly to instal judges who are slightly impartial who naturally take a completely wrong view of the concept of justice .
for this reason , I share many of the concerns raised by the rapporteur , even if I do not agree entirely with all of the proposed solutions .
it is not only that the likelihood of being discovered is small . Even when it is finally possible to prove that a fraud has been committed , the Member States are not interested in instituting legal proceedings and recovering the money .
good examples certainly serve to encourage others to follow them .
I am a passionate advocate of enlargement because , having shaken off Communism , the countries of Central Europe have a right to join our community of values .
so far as publication is concerned , electronic media are an excellent resource for those who know what they are looking for .
report ( A5-0410 / 2001 ) by Mrs Färm , on behalf of the Committee on Budgets , on the proposal for a Council decision on amending Decision 2001 / 549 / EC of 16 July 2001 providing macro financial assistance to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia &#91; COM ( 2001 ) 618 - C5-0559 / 2001 - 2001 / 0258 ( CNS ) &#93;
the programme covers activities that seek to naturally maintain the ecological balance , to respect the environment , and to ensure security of supply while reducing energy import dependence , as the percentage of such imports is growing rapidly in the European Union . Also , by exploiting these renewable energies , it seeks to reach a certain balance with the technological advances made and to create jobs .
firstly , there can be no reliable European Neighbourhood Policy without a balanced geographical approach .
then we will develop our ideas on the way all our common policies can be better put to use in the service of employment .
I wish the Czech presidency all the best .
secondly , we state clearly that freedom of expression and assembly must be respected as the fundamental rights they are .
has the Commission drawn up such a document and , if so , what are the main new strategies for promoting the entrepreneurial activities of SMEs ?
thank you , Commissioner Piebalgs .
that is why I was so disappointed that the Commission apparently found the Italian Government deportation action against Romanians , largely Roma , and the accompanying rhetoric , compliant with EU free movement and anti-racism laws .
it is they who must improve their books .
no hospital has been bombed .
we do need to ask ourselves whether this will really help in the long term .
the ruling calls into question our very identity , our European values of peace , love and civil harmony , of equality and freedom , and the ruling therefore undermines freedom and equal rights .
I have to say to the President-in-Office that it is rather surprising that there is no mention of this in the Council opinion .
it is a question of attacking the image of smoking .
the report supports and reinforces the key proposal in the Green Paper concerning how to assess proportionality in national actions which appear to be obstacles to the internal market .
this report emphasises the role of the Member States and their competences , especially their role in securing jobs leading to economic growth and prosperity .
although the Commissioner said that this has been known for some time , the studies which have outlined the sort of job losses we are talking about have in fact been relatively recent .
Parliament has repeatedly called for the EDF to be integrated into the budget .
the Commission &apos;s proposal is unacceptable on the grounds of being premature and incapable of being managed by producers under favourable conditions .
the all-round intensification of cooperation and partnership , the reasonable use of resources and the avoidance of duplication , an appeal to members of both to be more flexible , goal-oriented and pragmatic - this report contains everything that we in Europe , and also in the European Parliament , have always emphasised in our positions .
we are now turning for the first time directly to the citizens of Europe in our preparations for an Intergovernmental Conference .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , as one of the Tokyo Co-Chairs of the Sri Lanka peace process , the European Commission and I personally have been following the developments in Sri Lanka very closely .
dual pricing during the transition period is an absolute must , and should not be optional as envisaged in the report .
therefore efficient protection requires more than just the protection of individuals : we need to protect entire groups .
if they were the issue , I would happily say to Mr Cappato – who criticised national legislation banning this type of research for being prejudiced – that there is no prejudice here ; this word is always used as a smokescreen when there is disagreement .
we have been fighting for years for proper overall budgetary control , both for compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure .
in the first place then , the priority for the Council must be to coordinate European efforts to prevent a fresh crisis from breaking out in Burundi , along with the initiative at present being pursued by President Nyerere and the USA , but not without making a clear request to the United Nations Security Council to review its own position .
these considerations also need to be taken into account if total greenhouse gases are to be correctly calculated .
what it boils down to is that there is not enough start-up capital available for people who want to set up in business , and so numerous young entrepreneurs have to give up again prematurely .
we have chosen to abstain in the final vote on this report .
we are being asked to change a regulation which entered into force a few months ago .
those arrests demonstrate that Serbia is able to locate and arrest the remaining war fugitives .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of my group and , I think , all of Parliament , I should like to really emphasise our sympathy with the people and government of Brazil for their real sorrow in relation to the floods of recent days .
we have not put a foot wrong over the last few years .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I do not ask for more .
I therefore repeat once again , and I would like to cite the European Commission in its explanatory statement , it is not the intention to establish limiting values which apply to the entire European Union .
for all that , Mr Prodi , your term of office had begun with the best possible omens .
it does not seem as if an international military force for Burundi is going to get off the ground .
it is high time a change was made .
secondly , that the periodic universal reviews also include the participation of independent experts .
in this context , Mrs Bozkurt &apos;s excellent report places great emphasis on how the situation of women in Turkey is evolving , for which the rapporteur deserves commendation .
I should like to draw attention to an interesting moment in our work .
I am certain that the adoption by the European Parliament of a resolution on this report will contribute a great deal to the process of enlargement to include Croatia .
Europe should mainly focus on the outcome .
to make this country wait even longer would be to send out the wrong signals .
there is no mention of our obligations towards Community level services of general interest .
I said that it would be foolhardy to suggest that circumstances do anything other than contribute to the situation .
it is therefore high time that the EU entered into negotiations and introduced sanctions .
( applause )
what do the European institutions think of wide-scale vaccinations ?
obviously , when a company in a dominant position is abusing its position , for instance , by behaving in such a way as to keep other competitors out of that market at any price or buying other companies to close them down to limit potential competition , there might be a problem .
I have also voted in favour of the amendment , which , at the same time , calls on Baroness Ashton to make full use of her powers .
nine months later , we are only just going to manage to donate EUR 170 million over 2005 .
for that reason , it might have a decisive impact if we associated the acceptance of this agreement - which I support - with a statement that there is still an enormous amount of catching up to do on human rights .
yes , it is .
of course the Ecolabel should be given to the most environmentally friendly products , and the information should be clear and correct .
