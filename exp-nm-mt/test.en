the explanatory statement clearly records that &quot; no agreement was reached &quot; between Member States , that there was &quot; considerable opposition in the Council &quot; and that there was rejection by &quot; business &quot; .
what is more , as you are all aware , a past ruling by the Court of Justice from 23 July 1988 states that the majorities required for a decision cannot be stipulated by each institution .
in conclusion , I believe that short sea shipping has a great future ahead of it in Europe , if it is run by seamen and states and not by large concerns that are only interested in pure profit , regardless of the economic , social and human cost .
we are absolutely committed to completing this process as quickly as possible .
faced with international crime , terrorist cells , the complexity of the networks and the sophistication of the methods used , not least regarding migration , we are in danger of being caught up and we have a duty to act immediately .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
of course , our proposal was rejected by the majority of this Assembly , but we were anxious to set a date .
allow me , however , to say , with Scandinavian directness , that there are no doubt also certain problems in relations between the European Parliament , the Commission and the Ombudsman .
if Article 179 provided the sole legal basis , this process would be exclusively in the hands of the Committee for Development , and our committee would lose its authority .
it would be nice if we could reduce this percentage in future .
Europe for us is responsibility for the environment .
I would like somebody here in this House to explain to me how the market can be said to be functioning when the cost to operators for transferring a text message from one country to another is less than 11 cents , while the average consumer has to pay more than 28 cents .
to settle as a border dispute the status of the Aegean , where Greece does not acknowledge that there is an issue ?
this reply caused a stir in Greece , due to the economic and social situation in the country .
Madam President , a few days ago presidential elections were held in the Republic of Cyprus .
Madam President , I had the deepest misgivings about allowing an unreformed Hamas to run candidates for the Palestinian elections .
Parliament and the Commission clearly share the same vision and the same goal for SEPA .
facing this situation , the Maltese people are asking : what is the European Union doing ?
I definitely believe that there are many reasons , and it would be a little excessive and arrogant to try to simplify the situation .
in particular , the common position includes : fully harmonised and detailed general information requirements ; the principle of written confirmation ; a right of withdrawal with some exceptions ; protection for the user on the chosen means of payment and redress in the event of disputes .
as far as I can see , there is just one small difference of opinion with regard to Parliament &apos;s wish to have a directive on this subject .
decent living obviously involves decent housing .
that would raise the quality of the bank &apos;s activities yet more .
I ask you to do so out of respect for democratic rights .
in addition , gambling is addictive .
finally , I would like to mention the foreign policy budget , which is clearly underfunded .
the debate we are having today on the content of this constitution should , if anything , be held amongst Hungarian people , and not in this House .
we will closely monitor the most promising technologies through the SET Plan information system .
the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon led to the establishment of the European External Action Service ( EEAS ) , whose activities should include a coordinated and consistent cultural diplomacy strategy .
you have our support .
that may in actual fact lead to the possibility of reducing military appropriations , without weakening military capability .
– Madam President , Commissioner Wallström , we are indeed using more batteries , and that is causing us problems .
amendment No 14 does not seem to us to be necessary , since the Commission &apos;s proposal specifies that all complaints are admissible , and Amendment No 15 would give the aircraft inspection authorities considerable additional work and anyway the practical usefulness of the supplementary information requested seems to us be doubtful to say the least .
it should make it possible to test new forms of cooperation and thus provide useful information for the new generation of programmes after 2006 .
( applause )
it is a European Council typified by the fear of the leaders in the face of the fear of the citizens .
we obviously do not support this .
in addition , on a formal issue , Mr President , could I say a couple of words since I have the floor ?
the EU must focus on the essential , and the intention behind the Commission ’ s simplification strategy is , or at least is said to be , to do away with needless regulation .
why would this be the first thing on the Council agenda ?
the effects of the global financial and economic crisis on developing countries and on development cooperation ( short presentation )
within 10 years , Europe must open its markets to 95 % of South African exports , while South Africa needs to open its markets to just 86 % of European exports .
Madam President , I also wish to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and very incisive explanatory statement , and welcome the Commissioner &apos;s statement this evening .
through you , Mr President , I would like to make a plea to the Commissioner this evening to look closely at the United Kingdom model and in particular to learn from the private finance initiative schemes operating in the United Kingdom .
human dignity must always be respected - it is the ethical answer to the moral crises in Europe &apos;s past .
having a strong , viable public broadcasting system that is free from political pressure or loss of editorial independence , and which benefits from sufficient funding , is vital .
up to now , plans for a European consensus on migration policy have been buried at the bottom of the political inbox .
only if the Union as a whole is competitive can we rely on all the issues connected with questions of solidarity being properly addressed .
sometimes it has been a bit of an effort for me to contrive that ending from a different subject , but not this evening .
the price paid by women for following their desire to be protagonists in all spheres is that they never have enough time .
before Christmas we had the strange outbursts from the Commission spokesperson in relation to the case concerning the collective selling of UK football premiership TV rights , and this tactic has been repeated in the Commission ’ s ongoing anti-trust investigation into Microsoft .
I can accept that , and the European public are aware that it was the European People &apos;s Party which split from top to bottom in March on the motion of censure in this House , with a majority voting the Socialist position .
under no circumstances , however , is it a relaxing of anti-grass roots policy ; it is another burden on grass-roots incomes for the benefit of big business .
the person involved has said that it is absurd , and the chairman of the club has said that it is in a very grave economic situation .
ECU 500 million is not chickenfeed .
we are all aware that Libya is persisting in a dictatorial regime , and is systematically violating international conventions on fundamental rights and freedoms .
the textile industry is not only important to southern Europe , as Belgium , too , for example , still has a very flourishing textile industry , which provides 25 000 jobs .
if , however , those in Croatia putting their hopes in the reliability of your statements are perhaps treated this afternoon in the same way as Bulgaria and Romania , then we should tell them in advance in Zagreb that they should have another word with Mr Poettering .
I do not want to hide the fact that I have great sympathy for this latter solution .
the primary objective is to reinforce the mutual trust of the officers concerned .
those who understand only the language of violence – and they are present on both sides – need to be isolated .
the women &apos; s conference in Beijing brought an important point to light .
the European Parliament &apos;s Temporary Committee on Climate Change has now submitted a report on how the EU should act in connection with climate change .
Mr President , I am grateful for an opportunity to add my congratulations to the rapporteur , Mr Camisón , on his report . My group is delighted to support it .
most importantly of course , all observers judged Georgia &apos;s presidential and parliamentary elections in January and March of this year to be the freest and fairest in Georgia &apos;s post-Soviet history .
this will also be important in the prevention of harm caused by passive smoking .
that is a principle which should be recognized by certain Member States which are still sceptical about a joint approach to certain problems as serious or as important as the three which are before the House today .
therefore , at this time , a definitive answer to the question cannot be given but , taking account of current opinions , it does not seem likely that this proposal will prosper in the near future and even less likely that it could affect persons who have not committed any crime .
it will fall to sociologists and historians to assess the causes and consequences of the issues surrounding the Roma .
the Commission does show respect for Parliament &apos;s resolutions .
the EU prohibits discriminating against citizens of other countries , but is it in accordance with the Treaty to discriminate against your own ?
we know that at the current stage of the conference , issues such as the weighting of votes , the extension of qualified majority voting and the simplification of legislative procedures have not yet achieved a minimum consensus .
if these immigrants , who are hoping for something called &quot; work &quot; , are living in these conditions , one can only guess at the miserable conditions being experienced by the five thousand Moroccans I referred to in my question , who are roaming around that region without work .
it is time that we spelt out the way it should be .
the next item is the report by Mrs Theato ( A4-0303 / 96 ) on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control , on the change of the legal basis of the proposal for a Council Regulation on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of the law on customs and agricultural matters ( COM ( 93 ) 0350 and COM ( 94 ) 34-4324 / 95 - C4-0212 / 95-00 / 0450 ( COD ) ) .
this year &apos;s Conference of the Parties will be particularly important for an assessment of the situation .
in particular , I would also like to express my gratitude for the great deal of support that our report has received .
I should like to say to all my colleagues how much I have been moved by their expressions of esteem and appreciation for my report . I would also immediately add that the report is the result of a joint effort and does not just reflect my concerns alone .
but this resolution offers some hope that relations can improve over time , and for that reason I voted to support it .
corruption brings poverty and impunity .
on Friday , I visited the football intelligence unit in the Greater Manchester police service .
now we will start its implementation , which involves a lot of technical work .
according to the patent directive , a gene sequence cannot be patented .
in these years we have never hesitated to point the finger at the Serb Republic as primarily responsible for the tragedies that have occurred , especially in Bosnia , and our resolutions have frequently defended the right of Croatia to have the territory occupied by the Serbs restored to it . But precisely because of this , at a time when a more peaceful situation is developing in former Yugoslavia after the Dayton agreements - and this situation must develop - we cannot fail to condemn today , as forcefully as we have condemned mistakes and crimes in other countries , what is going on in Croatia itself as regards respect for human rights , respect for ethnic minorities , press freedom , press pluralism and , last but not least , the point you mentioned , Mr Fassino , about Croatia &apos;s commitment to cooperate with the Hague Tribunal and hand over those suspected of serious crimes .
as regards research , money particularly needs to be invested in market research , that is to say into what products consumers buy , and also , of course , in product research - for example , how can renewable energy be produced in the agricultural sector to counteract Europe &apos;s dependence on imports ?
is the change in the ratio of gross national product to budget from 1.11 % in the year 2000 to 1.07 % in the year 2001 a step backwards ?
I agreed with this resolution on the proposal for a Council decision authorising enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection .
this is probably due to the fact that , contrary to widespread perceptions , the overall number of people claiming asylum in the west has dropped by more than 40 % over the past decade , according to data just released by the United Nations .
on the contrary , they underline the need to adopt further proposals for Council regulations , covering the whole field of family law : divorce , separation , maintenance and property matters .
Zimbabwe , for decades a stable country , is now going through an increasingly severe economic and political crisis .
end of quote .
we want to stress that with the adoption of this report in plenary , the presidium of this House should take up its responsibility and act immediately on the text adopted as far as the voluntary pension fund is concerned , and that clear decisions should be taken to the effect that under no circumstances will the voluntary pension fund be bailed out with extra money from Parliament &apos;s budget , either directly or indirectly , and that the list of participants in the fund will be made public without further delay .
these inferior products on the market are cheating consumers and bringing herbal medicines into disrepute .
this has to be defined .
negotiations are progressing well here and that is significant .
both have come to the decisive answer that in these five cases which we are discussing today , the correct legal basis ought to be Article 43 .
that is the purpose of the new regulation , which replaces a directive and at the same time tightens up the conditions that companies must meet .
particularly once Economic and Monetary Union has come into force , there is no doubt that Member States , who are being stripped of what margin for manoeuvre they had on budgetary and monetary policy , will not easily relinquish their prerogative on tax matters ; there will certainly be resistance .
it is for that reason that I harbour the wish that this great people of culture will rid itself of this leadership sooner rather than later .
there is no doubt that the primary and principal requirement in animal husbandry , to be adhered to in the areas of breeding , veterinary health , hygiene and prophylaxis , is that keeping a system of animal husbandry as self-contained as possible can make an important contribution to the protection of animals and also to their health and to that of human beings .
then we make a switch in our minds and look to the budget debate next week in the Committee on Budgets and later this month with the vote in Strasbourg .
we abstained on today &apos;s report from Mr Stubb as we are concerned that the term , &apos; controlled full multilingualism &apos; , could be used to restrict the amount of written material available to Irish speakers in comparison to speakers of other official and working languages .
I have also tabled an amendment to develop a common method of measurement which will enable us to curb competition between different airports , as referred to by Mr Wiersma .
a woman who served time in prison , and two of whose children are still in prison ?
on the other hand , it is not a question of climbing down on the issue of pollution , which is still important , but simply of using a criterion that will ensure that basic common sense is applied .
even so , we can say that the price has remained stable to date , making due allowance for customary seasonal factors .
European pension systems are in an increasingly alarming state .
we have taken a website that will enable us , I hope , to inform the NGO community and others more clearly about what is available .
the Commission hopes that these texts will be formally adopted in May at the latest , as soon as the Parliament &apos; s final reservations have been dispelled .
2 . Draft general budget 2010 ( Section III ) (
the amendment being proposed to Parliament &apos;s Rules of Procedure is aimed at establishing and maintaining a common register for the registration and monitoring of organisations and individuals who participate in any way in the drafting and implementation of EU policy .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , thank you all for very interesting contributions , especially the introductory exposé of Klaus-Heiner Lehne .
the statistics collated in the Member States reveal extremely high and in some cases terrifying levels of violence .
in connection with the drawing up of the report , I had a number of additional proposals in the opinion of the Committee on Employment on the report which above all emphasize the social and environmental aspects of public procurement .
that is a good idea , and we should retain it .
the second trap is the issue of reparations .
Mr President , there is guilt on both sides , but an overreaction on the part of Israel over this report and indeed over Operation Cast Lead .
the implementation of the revised Accession Partnership is also important to prepare for further integration with the European Union .
but the most striking feature about Italy is that it continues to show extremely deep-rooted regional disparities .
however , I am disappointed that there is no further evidence of any development in regard to digital literacy .
these weapons have been banned for a very long time , but are unfortunately still available .
there is no question of a huge amount of money being transferred from the one part of Europe to the other , so I would say , rest assured , there will be enough time to sort things out after 2006 .
it was pointed out thirteen years ago that the internal market had a transnational dimension and that that could lead to problems amongst workers in companies of a transnational nature , since they should take decisions in consultation with everybody without prejudicing a few or prejudicing everybody .
consequently , as the European Parliament , we too must contribute to the clear differentiation of the competences of the Community institutions to which European citizens can take recourse in order to exercise their rights .
the next item is the report ( A4-0107 / 96 ) by Mr Pex , on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations , on the draft Council Regulation ( EURATOM , EC ) concerning the provision of assistance to economic reform and recovery in the New Independent States and Mongolia ( 4546 / 96 - C4-0090 / 96-95 / 0056 ( CNS ) ) .
next year &apos;s legislative initiatives for unskilled and seasonal migrants and remunerated trainees will follow .
studies show that the era of cheap food on the international market is over .
Mr Pierre Pflimlin and Mr Piet Dankert are no longer with us .
that will make them sure that this openness will not be abused unilaterally by an escape clause .
in conclusion I would like to propose that we give free , and I repeat free , trade a chance , so that it can help to eliminate poverty .
if a country , with an eye to its own labour market and its economy , thinks it needs to continue to regulate access to the labour market , then it is perfectly entitled to do so . Here too , the ‘ ’ rule applies , and neither the Commission nor this House – perhaps not even a majority in the latter – should venture to exert pressure by making appeals to one country or another .
although I am making this commitment to your House , it is not your House that should be concerning itself with this issue ; on the contrary , it is primarily a matter for us back in Austria .
a document published by Parliament ’ s Press Service declared that freedom of information in Italy is the most important issue in this sitting and once again declared that freedom of information is endangered in Italy .
what I am proposing is something similar to what Senator Mitchell did in Northern Ireland .
we have seen many examples of this before in European politics .
B5-0546 / 2002 by Mr Sakellariou and others , on behalf of the PSE Group , on the General Affairs Council &apos;s position concerning the International Criminal Court ;
therefore , I would like Parliament to help us in getting the balance right and in sending the right signal to the rest of the world .
Mr President , Commissioner , fellow women MEPs , if we want to improve our democracy - and that should be our objective here - it is essential that we share responsibilities and power .
Mr President , in the European Parliament , the room for young people and children is still , even now , equipped in only a very Spartan fashion .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , let me start by expressing my respect for the rapporteur and for his thoroughly ambitious effort that we are debating in this House today . Although the report contains many good individual measures , I am unable to vote in favour of it .
this means that the ceiling of 0.25 % mentioned in Article 23 does not apply with regard to this type of technical assistance .
under this name , there were technical assistance bureaux working completely properly and we could not harm them and , consequently , what we did in such cases also , was to suspend the contracts , with all that that entailed .
a report that clearly stated that tax policy is a matter for each nation and which recommended improved coordination between the Member States in this area would have received my vote .
I would even ask for more , I would ask the Commission to consider reopening its office in Malabo .
second-generation biofuels are produced from feedstock other than food crops and can come not only from dedicated energy crops but also from sources such as recycled vegetable oil , animal fat , by-products from the forestry industry , forestry residues and solid waste such as grasses .
to eliminate the remaining obstacles in the internal market , it is absolutely necessary to consolidate and improve the European legislation .
progress has been made in terms of some of the amendments now tabled .
I welcome the changes in the area of freedom , security and justice , where action will have more ambitious goals and more effective procedures , no longer using intergovernmental instruments and procedures .
in Sweden , it was only when , in 1994 , we had a situation in which half of our politicians and Members of the Swedish Parliament were women that we were able to implement major reforms .
the budgets of recent years , the budgets for which we have been jointly responsible , may be regarded as the lowest in the history of European financial perspectives .
what you said is correct : we need patience , we need wisdom and we need balance .
because they are joint legislators with us , I believe the Member States will apply the rules we are approving .
your backing is crucial to maintain widespread visibility for the strategy to maintain high-level political support for the strategy and to maintain pressure on the Member States and the regional actors to deliver results .
an airline may demand conversion of its aviation allowances to these Kyoto-backed allowances , and the issuing Member State must comply .
I give the floor to Mr Papoutsis to answer Mrs García Arias &apos;s question .
that is a fact and it has nothing to do with nationalism .
under the Code of Conduct , Member States who grant a licence for an essentially identical transaction previously denied by another Member State should consult that Member State .
what money can we use to enter into another imbroglio , like the Lisbon Strategy , which was never achieved but certainly not for want of trying by the European Parliament ?
according to the framework agreement , it is only the Conference of Presidents , Parliament &apos; s President and the chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control who can ask the Commission for information .
it is unacceptable that Musharraf should show such a cavalier disregard for democracy .
as you know , we have no knowledge of the fate of certain journalists in the Ukraine .
ladies and gentlemen , in 25 days &apos; time , in Dublin , we will be asking the Heads of State and Government , in their turn , to make the broad outlines of this pact a reality .
the EU should be tackling the fishing problems of the northern regions as well as those in the Mediterranean .
also , it is stated that this is only provided this interim agreement remains in force , which I consider as pure blackmail .
I wish to assure you that one of the aims of the Irish presidency is to make the EU more focused , more flexible and more responsive at the United Nations .
Mr Marinescu , I think we are constantly trying to evaluate implementation , but it is true that , for the time being , we cannot discuss legislative provisions again .
it is not a form of renationalisation , to reply to a fear that has just been expressed .
I am pleased that there has been a trend reversal in the public consciousness with regard to public deficits in recent years .
the second major amendment is to give an exemption for 12 months for temporary workers placed in user companies . That is only for pay and financial benefits , not for health and safety .
this is the first time , in fact , that the Commission has made use of its new system for responding immediately to the sudden onset of humanitarian crises which came into operation less than two weeks ago .
unfortunately , all we can do is to reaffirm our feeling of revulsion and absolute condemnation of this indiscriminate violence .
the big picture in this matter is , of course , specifically the United States &apos; relations with the surrounding world .
rural areas have to be viewed from three standpoints : sociological , as a world to be promoted and developed , ecological , as a space to be put in order and protected , and cultural , as the home of the principles and traditions which have given rise to collective awareness .
its strength is provided by the 27 Member States , which could increase in number in the not too distant future .
we have , however , abstained on this report as it only addresses this matter from the point of view of the airlines and airport management bodies .
I should therefore once again like to call on the rapporteur to tone down the reservations he expressed concerning Amendments Nos 30 , 32 and 48 , which were accepted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens &apos; Rights .
that is most important of all .
10 . 2006 discharge : EU general budget , section I - European Parliament (
the EU should not be putting any pressure here on developing countries and forcing them to liberalise public services .
if the Caribbean Sea area and the Pacific Ocean experience special problems , which they do , we should try to use EPAs as a targeted and generous solution to them .
if we do more in our own communities and work more with the elected Members in the Member States , we can achieve a great deal together .
in this case as well , therefore , we welcome progress , but as yet this progress hardly corresponds to our ideas of democracy and the rule of law .
in an attempt to reduce the number of vessels by the doctrine of laisser faire economics the United Kingdom Government has left the fishing industry in Britain suffering at the hands of market forces .
third , the Commission indicated in the feasibility study that it would expect proper cooperation with the High Representative in his reform agenda , as provided for in the Dayton Paris Peace Accords .
I think it only fair that we should do this , not only for this House , but also for the benefit of other committees of inquiry in – for example – other parliaments .
the least that can be asked is that we repeal and suspend the Association Agreement , just as the European Parliament has requested .
there is a lot more to be said , but the budget discharge process is now only at the beginning and within the coming months Members of Parliament will have all the answers to their questions .
religious freedom is a fundamental right of individuals and communities ; it entails respect for the integrity of all religious convictions and all ways in which they are exercised .
that is better done by other regimes regulating various industries , and we have a good regulatory regime in most of our industries in the European Union now .
I would also be eager for the Commission to investigate the viability of expanding trade defence instruments to deter environmental and social dumping in order to ensure that an unfair advantage is not obtained through the abuse of the environment or through failure to ensure decent labour standards .
only a knowledge of our actual origins , history and traditions will enable us to understand the values of peace , solidarity and tolerance which constitute the pillars for the construction of Europe .
if we are to have good research in all the universities and all the areas of the Community , it is really important for people to be able to work in their own language , even though , of course , most scientists work in English much of the time .
I should be grateful for an answer from the Commission and also from the rapporteur , if he is given the floor at the end of the debate .
( Parliament rejected the oral amendment )
in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity , the Member States may include more than the minimum number of questions and may also provide for supplementary oral questions .
it is therefore important for us to continue with the expansive financial policy .
that requires an effort of communication .
it is standard procedure , Mr Staes .
this does not mean , however , that we can allow Turkey to worm its way stealthily into the European Union .
with the strong help of UN agencies and other partners , we have facilitated the return of 70 000 refugees and 50 000 internally displaced persons since the inauguration .
I do , however , remain concerned about two points .
among its multiple benefits for both sides , it is also worth noting the establishment of a level playing field for the industry , as well as common or compatible standards for safety , security and air traffic management .
( ES ) Mr President , Commissioner , we are dealing with a reform that is simple but extremely important for the outermost regions .
there needs to be a real awareness of the risks associated with synthetic drugs .
let us take Sapard as our first practical example .
( PT ) Although there are aspects of this report with which I agree , I feel I must draw attention to what I would describe as the appropriation of a report - on the situation of human rights in the world , of all things - as a tool of political coercion .
one way of producing such counter pressure is through the support given to the Palestinians .
the second vital aspect , Mrs Ashton , is that a war cannot be won - and there is currently a war in progress in Afghanistan - without having the civilian population on our side , on the side of the international coalition .
– Mr President , in some European Union countries we are witnessing new forms of right-wing extremism that are of great concern to all democrats .
I was fortunate enough to act as chairman of this Parliament ’ s delegation in Belarus for five years and we have had bad experiences with elections in that country in the past .
and as regards the safety of tunnels in particular , I should like to remind the House of other proposals which have yet to be adopted .
I would like to mention , as others have done before me , the illegal transit of meat , for example in Flushing harbour , and I would also like to mention the infected cow in Belgium which was turned into bone meal .
I therefore welcome this debate and look forward to hearing your views on how we should shape this relationship in the years to come .
anyhow , the Irish must use their own time and not the others &apos; time .
the Conservatives have set the pace at national level when it comes to many of the measures discussed in the report .
this summit will take place in June and , in my opinion , it will demonstrate that the relaunch of transatlantic dialogue is a strong one , with very clear aims .
Mr McMahon said as much already .
that is exactly right .
I am also pleased that many Finnish Members of our House signed the request for an urgent debate , quite irrespective of their party allegiance , as a sign that the situation is critical and that ideology has no part to play here .
secondly , there are specific measures that need to be taken on all the markets , not just dairy .
the stability of disposal facilities must also be ensured in order to prevent the occurrence , or reduce the impact , of accidents .
then , from the US , where there is no law on these matters , the idea emerged of extending patentability into this area .
however , we also failed much closer to home , in our own territory .
indeed , Commissioner Prodi was actually a steering committee member in the eighties at the same time as Wim Duisenberg was the treasurer of Bilderberg .
even worse , the subject was hardly mentioned .
as you have requested it , I will indeed keep it brief .
amendment No 8 is similar to Amendment No 7 and while a common donor identification and registration system is certainly the ideal , donors themselves , on whom the entire blood transfusion chain is dependent , are reluctant to be even on national registers and a single donor identification and registration system common to all Member States contradicts the Commission proposal for a mutually compatible system .
how often do I read in the paper that one or other incident has occurred .
the European Project and the citizens who believe in it have no truck with the kind of national self-interest thus far demonstrated by this Presidency .
however , I strongly support a very strict approach concerning access to the occupation of road transport operator .
I see Commissioner de Silguy in the House and I wonder if he is now prepared to make a statement on what is happening or at least consider the request from Parliament to make a statement .
my question is not the same , because I put it in a European key and with an extremely constructive intention .
Mr President , I will gladly convey this suggestion to Mr Papoutsis .
I would therefore like to offer my thanks for your collaboration on this specific aspect .
we shall listen more clearly to European citizens &apos; voices , and we should not be afraid to do so .
specifically because , four years ago , this Commission was presented with a National Hydrological Plan whereby water would be carried to these regions , indeed to the whole of the agricultural area .
this is understood by the numerous European cities trying to take part in the project .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I will not go over the fundamentals of this agreement as they have been described by Mr Kindermann , who has rightly highlighted the fact that only one of the three states , Lithuania , has so far also accepted the second generation component .
but could we not address these matters much more directly without the &quot; demographic illusion &apos; ?
I fully agree with the need for a strong and effective Agency and believe that this can be achieved through the approach suggested by the Commission where the Agency will develop codes that involve real substantive discretion and that these are then adopted through comitology .
now , since you have brought the timetable forward - something which does not happen often but which we greatly welcome - I would like to ask , if the debate on the question is to be included in Thursday &apos;s agenda , to include the vote on the motion for a resolution which the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is to adopt on 30 September in the first October part-session .
instead of corrective or repressive solutions , priority should be given to preventive solutions , creating a different kind of family setting , which would finally enable us to prevent pointless suffering on a personal and on a social scale and to practise a genuine policy of inclusion and socialisation from birth onwards .
I would like to remind him that Britain maintains its colonisation of my country , Cyprus , to this day .
without a decisive programme for basic structural reforms , which improve the ability of European business to compete , the digital era will be a time of frustration for Europe , hence our amendment designed to remind us of this fact which is so obvious and yet so worrying .
any reconstruction must be broader based and more sustainable .
this is bound to weaken the Union sooner or later .
one good solution to this disastrous trend is legislation imposing a high percentage of recycling of individual materials .
prominent persons in Moldovan society are asking for an explanation .
Mr President , Commissioner Patten challenged us to justify to our electorate a demand for an increase in defence expenditure .
we must reconcile ourselves to the fact that the Slovak Republic will lose one Member as a result of the agreed principle of digressive proportionality .
on the one hand , it has a functional role as the tool in achieving communication between people of different origins .
( DE ) Mr President , I should like to bring to your notice that , when I , like many other Members , was applauding your last announcement , Jean-Marie Le Pen made this hand gesture , signifying ( EN ) &apos; Fuck you ! &apos;
the fact that President Hu Jintao had to shorten his participation in the G8 Summit in Italy to return to China indicates that the Chinese Government realises that events in the province are not just an isolated incident .
that is what Commissioner Patten has constantly reiterated , calling for a serious and concerted effort required to reform and rebuild the Palestinian Authority , as the only viable interlocutor in future peace talks .
therefore , my group will also agree to the amendment &apos; s being deferred , because the Council must first do its work .
they will be worth absolutely nothing !
Mr President , when I hear the litany of crises and problems that confront us , I am alarmed that so many think that the answer to these problems is more European Union .
although the result of the presidential elections in the Republika Srpska does constitute a symbolic defeat , it is compensated for by the substantial gains for parties supporting Dayton at all levels of government .
women and children continue to be raped and trafficked .
we cannot permit this kind of heavy goods vehicle in Europe .
they are making huge profits and we here are benefiting from those profits .
there is an imbalance in the Administration and I would like to be sure that the Administration is seen from the outside as being effective and politically balanced .
the world is reacting in different ways to events in Belarus .
in writing . - ( EL ) I voted for the report on the situation of fundamental rights in Europe , because I believe that it touches on one of the most basic problems of our unifying structure by engaging in constructive criticism .
it is also only a credit , even if the conditions are better than those of the EMF .
finding ways of ensuring that trade policy helps to resolve the poverty issue , however , is no easy task .
that is why the climate change programme that we are discussing today is an important building block towards combining environmental policy channels with economic performance and social justice .
that is therefore my wish , expressed with a sense of our having fulfilled our duty and of our having , in the course of this week , made some decisive progress .
for this reason , among other things , during the Finnish presidential term , we will be publishing Council and other committee agendas , so that people may know , if they need to , what issues are up for discussion , and so that , if necessary , they can find out more about those issues and , besides , hold public debates on them .
ought young people not be at least as much worth to us as a fraction of what is spent on subsidising the cultivation of tobacco ?
it only makes sense if we prevent this in unison and only then , Commissioner , does the White Paper on food safety , which you have presented , also make sense .
Mr President , I am sorry that my comments have to be directed at Commissioner Barnier , whom I hold in the highest regard , because my complaint applies to a different Commissioner .
we must therefore conduct this policy wisely .
for this reason , when economic issues are negotiated , increased attention should implicitly be given to the laws regarding the respect for the rights of immigrant workers and women .
at this time , although the Transport Council has taken a decision , no decision has been reached by the ECOFIN Council on whether or not to take this matter further .
since it is the season for goodbyes , I shall now say my own .
. – I said in a previous reply that one must understand both sides in this difficult situation .
Mr President , have you noticed that , not just the Commissioner , but the president and the rapporteur are also women , a coincidence which I think augurs well for the future of GALILEO , even if he was a man .
in 2005 , there were 140 000 company insolvencies in the European Union of the 15 , threatening 1.5 million jobs .
that is a very important correction .
by Georgios Stavrakakis , on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control , on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the Community Fisheries Control Agency for the financial year 2009 ( SEC ( 2010 ) 0963 - C7-0244 / 2010 - ;
it identified numerous applications for standardization and we , as representatives of the citizens of Europe , are most keenly aware of the value and opportunities that this aspect of the single market standard can give us .
is not the agreement on the search for better living conditions today particularly symbolic ?
on Mrs Kjer Hansen &apos;s rather critical remark on what has not been done , I can only say that when she reads the Court &apos;s report - I must give credit here to that report and to the DAS paper - she will see that it carefully points out where the Commission - especially with regard to DAS - has taken action on what it has proposed .
high quality annual population estimates are needed because they have implications for two fundamental axes of the European Union : the Union &apos;s democratic process , where the annual population estimates are used for the strict calculation of qualified majority voting in the Council , and also for the purposes of convergence of the Structural Funds , the main priority of the EU &apos;s cohesion policy , specifically in determining which regions are eligible .
at the same time , we would stress the importance of establishing a stricter regime on exemptions from the aforementioned ban .
it has been compared to the 1992 Single Market Programme .
it is not just about Brazilian beef .
so I wonder , firstly : can the Commission , via their information offices in the cities , give us an update on what progress has been made , in other words have you succeeded ?
finally , I turn to the Bastos report on reconciling professional , family and private lives .
I am concerned that a blanket exclusion of patents - an important intellectual property right - might risk depriving many industries of the benefits of this chapter .
I am very worried about his memory , or perhaps it is his education .
it is not just about the number of chickens per square metre ; it is also about the atmospheric conditions in the houses and whether there is straw or anything in them , so that the chickens have slightly better conditions during their very short lives .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we can welcome the fact that Article J.7 of the Treaty on European Union allows us to have an annual debate on the implementation of the Common Foreign and Security Policy .
I am extremely concerned that the requirement made in Amendment No 3 to the report - that the Member States should gradually establish a uniform and concerted procedure with regard to asylum , immigration and the crossing of Member States &amp; # x02BC ; external frontiers - will result in the European Union building even higher walls against the outside world and make it even harder for political refugees to find sanctuary with us .
11 . Multilateral Agreement on the Establishment of a European Common Aviation Area ( vote )
I see this as the major challenge facing all of us .
I look forward to the participation of Malta and other applicant countries in the Europe of the new millennium .
altogether , several hundred more workers have been made redundant .
I welcome this new Community programme , which brings together four previous programmes and seeks to streamline them and to provide more money for their implementation .
the first speaker in the debate today , Mr Ribeiro e Castro , mentioned the broad scope of threats we face - for example , terrorism , organised international crime , trafficking , etc . I want to tell him that he is absolutely right that we must tackle these threats .
we expect the Constitutional Court of Appeal also to recognise the ordinance this week , and we shall produce the final resolution next week .
in fact , it is changing this attitude which is one of the most difficult aspects of combating poverty .
furthermore , there is a special reference to the islands of the Aegean in paragraph 52 , where the Commission calls for immediate measures to be taken on behalf of their inhabitants .
consequently , this did not prevent me from voting in favour .
I can assure you , Mr Baco , that everything has been done perfectly correctly .
. Absolutely !
the first concerns the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms .
I am referring , obviously , to the Lomé Convention , to this partnership pact that is a bit exclusive , a bit special , and that we have always described as the European Union &apos; s response to the former colonies , as well as to other areas , but which mainly addresses the African continent .
the Arab peace initiative was affirmed , unanimously , last spring .
the Commission is always reminding us of this , but the Member States and certain segments of the fishing industry are clearly in denial .
as Mr Böge said , the Treaty of Lisbon commits the European Union to new priorities .
well , it is very useful for MEPs to know to whom , when and how the Council and the ambassadors in third countries provide their support under the guidelines for the protection of human rights defenders .
a policy of strategic ring-vaccination around outbreaks may be appropriate in certain circumstances even though we still cannot distinguish commercially between infected and vaccinated animals .
it is hoped that legislating against employers employing illegal migrants from third countries will be an instrument for reducing the &apos; pool-factor &apos; of illegal migration .
in this context , I must emphasise the fact that the Council &apos; s draft budget represents less than 1.10 % of the Community &apos; s GDP , an amount which is already quite low in itself and what is more , is considerably lower than the ceiling of 1.27 % set in Edinburgh and confirmed in Berlin . This should be cause for serious reflection for those who want Europe to do more and to do it better .
interconnection of transport modes is also important .
if there really is overcompensation , then it must be judged objectively by reference to the prices the farmer can command in his market and in his local currency .
we have great interests there as has been pointed out : the financial contribution we make to the Palestinians and also , of course , the trade association agreements we have with the Israelis .
however , agreement has also been reached on the possibility of including other issues , and the representative of the northern part of the island , Rauf Denktash , has suggested three new topics : sovereignty , confidence-building measures and the issue of lifting the embargo on products from the north of the island .
the Commission &apos;s proposals on price support provide for a reduction in the price of milk of 17 % , and a reduction in the intervention prices for both butter and skimmed milk powder of 15 % .
I think the Thessaloniki Council needs to push on with the reform of the Treaties of the European Union .
cooperation and political relations with the European Union cannot be improved , however , unless the Moldovan Government ’ s mandate is based on an entirely democratic expression of the popular will ; if not , it will be difficult to have dealings with that country in the years ahead .
let me say that quite plainly .
we assure you today that we shall repay it with the positive role of our contribution and our consistency towards what we call a Europe of all the peoples , a strong , powerful Europe , a Europe of prosperity , security and stability .
there is , moreover , the issue of governance , which Europe has to address in order to establish a control mechanism at international level .
the current climate of rocketing food prices is a serious threat in terms of political , financial and social destabilisation in many countries around the world , so we must react quickly . It goes far beyond the capacity of the European Commission , or even of the European Union .
that needs to be made very clear .
if traffic in human beings is meant , in other words the essential denial of people &apos; s fundamental rights and the imposition of forced labour , this raises the question why the report on which we have just voted devotes so little attention to the protection of victims , of those who are traded .
as usual , it thinks in terms of Parliament &apos;s prerogatives , of power relationships and politicking .
and of course he is right that we must fight organized crime and global trafficking , but identifying the culprits is only part of the battle .
to this end , since my position and that of my party was clear , public and expressed prior to the vote , I would like to ask you formally that my vote in favour of the Watson report and Amendments Nos 117 and 118 be registered , as that is how I would have voted had I been present .
John Hume , the Nobel Peace Prize laureate , also attended our group meeting today , and he stressed how important it had always been for him to perceive and acknowledge the differences in this Europe of ours – not just the differences between two sides , but differences on the same side .
- ( DE ) Madam President , may I take this opportunity not only to explain that I voted in favour , but also to raise an issue which is of great concern to me , namely the problem of taxation of aviation fuel .
Madam President , may I congratulate you on the deft , adroit and sensitive way in which you have exercised the prerogatives of the Chair .
Mr Leinen , earlier today , told us that it was actually more of a social Europe .
Mr President , I would like towards the end of our debate , which has quantitatively certainly been extensive but also qualitatively appropriate to the subject , to try , both for the relationship of the European Union with Latvia and also for its neighbour states Estonia and Lithuania , in other words for the relationship of the European Union with the Baltic states at least to indicate a greater connection in time and space .
let us do all in our power to stop the carnage on our roads .
in my area , which is between the Belgian border zone - in which I live - and the Netherlands , the opportunity is currently presenting itself to deploy 800 workers at a large company , Volvo , just across the border .
I agree with the rapporteur that this is an important report and I agree with his suggestions .
we are aware of the power of veto within the Security Council , and we know that some countries are constantly using it in order to block any initiative on the part of the international community .
we are gathering evidence in this respect and are discussing it with stakeholders .
now for my second question .
after the disaster in Madeira , Europe was hit once again .
a German goes to Hungary for dental treatment , a British national - if he has the means - goes to France so as to be operated on more quickly .
( PL ) Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mrs Ayala Sender on her excellent report .
it is going to be difficult though because , as I have said , it touches matters of public policy within our various countries .
some speakers raised the issue of the future of our enlargement policy .
the texts in Irish are equally authentic and have equal status with those in all the other languages .
our parliament has total responsibility for health , the environment , justice , education , fishing , agriculture and many more areas , yet the EU view of subsidiarity too often stops at the Member State when , in fact , the more relevant partner may well be much more local .
as Lord Bach and Commissioner Verheugen said earlier , we now have to seize the opportunity to speed up the decision-making and legislative process on this matter that has engaged so much of our attention .
in the 1970s , Haiti was almost self-sufficient where food was concerned .
I am resuming the sitting .
I remember the debate in this House with British Prime Minister Tony Blair , who was acting as though he had the solution ahead of the G20 Summit in London .
that is an important aspect of what we do as well .
it is a new reality that we have to come to terms with , and we can only cope with it if we remain united in defending our interests and our values .
we have to define a modern vision of the European Union and its purpose and relevance ; a vision based on concrete outcomes , not processes ; a vision based on certain key principles .
a lot of Member States will take a firm view that they believe they should have an input into this process .
in this way the Union is probably going to lose the unique opportunity of diversity and greater security ...
there is an urgent need to revise the EU directives for a credible and efficient system .
( CS ) Madam President , for two years , we have been discussing the alarming growth in counterfeit medicines on our market , including lifesaving medicines .
they are minimalist and grudging in their response to this crisis for the Irish airline .
a reminder of this has also been provided by the representatives of the disabled groups which have visited our committee : we must not create the type of society in which only the healthy are welcome .
it may even be the case that the increase in violence against women is an expression of the fear and aversion of traditional Turkish society towards European integration .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , there is no question that at this time of disappointment and rejection for the European Union given the attitude of the United States towards compliance with the Kyoto commitments , the European Parliament must unequivocally reaffirm and reinforce its commitment to making progress on the reduction of CO2 emissions through the ratification of the measures proposed in the protocol .
these subjects belong together since the Committee on Petitions is not only responsible for cooperation with the Ombudsman ; we see again and again that the work of each complements the other , and in the course of the last year we have been able to build up a solid basis of trust between the members of the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman , Mr Söderman , which we can use to the benefit of the citizens of Europe .
with regard to her efforts to achieve a coordinated position , I think it would have been sensible to involve her in this debate .
conferences and awareness-raising activities are positive measures that can contribute to increased tolerance and a more humane society .
the debate is closed .
it was a necessary and right thing to do , as it allowed us to have the first real negotiations at the political level on industrial goods and services , anti-dumping rules and development .
I am used to working , for example , with environmental NGOs and we give a lot of support to NGOs .
the whole range of our concerns has been put before us in no more than some forty minutes , and I now find it difficult to respond to all these things with the necessary brevity .
that should apply to all other European countries .
I would be grateful if you could take note of this .
furthermore , in its application , the Social Agenda should not , in my humble opinion , be treated as an unaltered or unalterable programme .
if the rapporteur can accept that amendment , then my Group will be able to vote for it .
on behalf of our group , I can state most firmly that we want a partnership and , if possible , friendship with Turkey .
the European Union has a major role to play where this reconstruction is concerned , and we believe that is as it should be .
I wish the delegation well for the remainder of their stay in the European Union .
I deeply regret that , rather than seizing this opportunity and building on it , our negotiating partners decided to take the easy way out , rejecting our offer on agriculture and criticising it – often in immoderate terms – rather than engaging with it and enabling us to move forward .
take a knife : it is extremely useful at home and in everyday life , but it becomes dangerous if it is used as a weapon for anything from attacking people to hijacking aircraft .
Morakot was the deadliest typhoon to hit Taiwan in nearly 50 years , ravaging the island in early August and leaving about 700 people dead or missing , forcing the evacuation of thousands and burying hundreds of village homes in mudslides .
the objective of this directive is to guarantee the interoperability of the information and communication technologies used in transport systems .
I would like just briefly to follow up one aspect , which I do not think you really touched on .
as I said in the question , a number of petitioners spoke with Mr Gemelli , in Asturias - my region - and then there were a series of visits to the Commissioner .
what is this ceiling ?
it says that the Court of Auditors has criticised the Commission and the Member States when , in fact , the opposite is true .
the Member has quite rightly taken the empathy which we have , as presidency , with the situation she outlines .
we would find ourselves in another crisis situation like the one we have just resolved .
Mr President , statistics can be quite tedious , but they are also immensely important .
a word to the wise ...
in turn , this has meant considerable reductions in the total operational amounts for the programmes .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( FR ) Mr President , for 10 years Europe &apos;s leaders have taken part in the Olympic Games of Indifference : running the fastest after contracts , jumping as high as possible over human rights and flying as fast as possible over the oppression in Tibet .
Commissioner , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I think we are all aware that retirement provision with a secure future has become one of the greatest challenges to budgetary policy , social security provision , our policies in the social sphere , and hence to humanity , in our time . This is due to demographic developments , that is , the fact that the coming years will see around one-third of the population past pensionable age , and by reason of the fortunate increase in life expectancy .
is it possible that there are institutions in this world – the CIA , to be precise – that operate in Europe in a legal framework that has nothing to do with the European way of life ?
I am delighted , for example , that the system of risk mitigation is being maintained , rather than relying solely on reduction in use alone , as , in practice , the reduction in use on its own does not always guarantee a reduction in risks .
the following questions are addressed to the Council .
with the tsunami , all of us , rich or poor , are in the same boat .
we need to tell those who cite shortcomings in road safety as justification for including self-employed workers that the rules on driving hours and rest times have long since been tightened up .
those people who are blind or visually impaired , on the other hand , will not benefit .
. I voted in favour of the motion on humanitarian aid to Iran following the recent earthquake in Bam .
education plays an important role in integration .
a good illustration of this is that it is now three years since the Justice Ministers declared that it was important to appoint national rapporteurs to monitor trafficking in women .
besides money we also have to export social welfare and democracy to the northern neighbouring regions . Our group supports projects to prevent the sexual exploitation of women and children and to combat the disease and social problems that poverty brings with it .
another point about the objective of the communication is that it needs to be more explicitly aimed at reducing ship emissions of greenhouse gases in particular , looking especially at the impact on global warming .
the financial crisis in Asia also changed the situation .
at the same time , we are strengthening numerous informal contacts and talks at a technical level .
the recent persistent wave of redundancies by numerous large companies as the result of closures or restructuring measures has reached worrying proportions .
we have to make sure that there is an economic dynamism that shows we can be competitive in the global economy .
this is not a resolution for doing nothing , as many Americans would say , but assures widespread support for that action and much of it has been outlined here this morning .
the objective of a free trade agreement was already included in the PCA when it was concluded in 1994 .
this problem is even more acute in rural areas .
worthy of praise here is the Eurobus initiative - a journey around Ukraine organised every year for young people from the EU &apos;s Member States .
I hope that , even while it is under intense internal pressure , it can use its expertise in these areas to enhance cooperation beyond the EU to a global level .
this step is urgently needed in a European Union with open borders .
secondly , the so-called &apos; maximum rate of increase &apos; in Article 27 of the EC Treaty - usually a source of conflict in the annual negotiation process - will no longer be in use or necessary because the substitute in practical terms for the maximum rate of increase , the multi-annual financial framework , will be enshrined in the treaties , which is not the case today .
I cannot agree with this position at all and I would like to ask you to support the position of the European Parliament from first reading .
we must find all possible means by which we can reduce car fuel consumption .
in my opinion , urgent steps must be taken to rectify this state of affairs , and to ensure that citizens from the new Member States are represented equally within Parliament ’ s administration .
we shall proceed to the second part of questions to the three Commissioners here today .
therefore , in its medium-term priorities in the draft partnership agreement for accession , the Council has included the requirement that conditions in Turkish prisons be changed to conform to the UN &apos;s rules as regards minimum standards for the treatment of prisoners .
for me , Great Britain , excessive individual compensation , for you , New Zealand , the possibility of more exports .
once the Charter becomes legally binding under the Reform Treaty , we will even be able to say that the death penalty has been abolished in the European Union at all levels .
had we discussed this issue two or three years ago , I am sure Parliament would not have thought it possible for us to be in a situation where we have a document like Agenda 2000 , which contains so much environmental thinking in the area of agricultural policy .
the new internal Commission security provisions will follow the model of the Council security regulation adopted earlier this year and will be based on the following principles : proportionality of security measures in relation to existing risks ; shared responsibility and accountability of staff , management and security experts ; the creation of all elements into a coherent security strategy , such as personal information and physical security ; and finally , close cooperation between European and national security organisations .
the signal has been given and the writing is on the wall for those who want to read it .
as soon as possible , the Commission must also table a proposal on the work programme and specify the funding for , and rules governing , its implementation so that it can be implemented quickly .
in my view these hearings were flawed because there was insufficient time available to the committees to pursue their lines of questioning .
allow me to say , however , that the magistrates of the Court of Appeal in Lyon , in sentencing Jean Plantin , have passed a judgment which - at the very least - fails to honour our fundamental freedoms and which will go down in the annals of history as an example of the unacceptable thought-policing denounced by one of our greatest journalists .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( NL ) Mr President , two major problems surrounding driving licences have been the cause of public annoyance .
I notice that one of our Members , Mr Madlener , has asked to speak under the blue card procedure .
their statistics are now on the Internet and you just have to click in order to select them for their race , the colour of their eyes and their level of education .
the first argument : Mr Tomczak complains that the Court of Ostrów did not grant him access to the files of the case .
I would ask you , therefore , to support the amendments supported by more than 60 members from different groups in this Parliament , ladies and gentlemen , because they will enrich the programme , on the basis of the full recognition of European historical memory and with a view to strengthening a feeling of citizenship .
as well as support for the companies I have mentioned , the European Investment Bank should also continue devoting significant attention to funding the development of a sustainable , competitive and secure energy infrastructure and a harmonious transport sector infrastructure .
I hope that Parliament will adopt both reports and I call upon all the Members to reflect on the need to avoid similar damaging disputes in the future and to achieve full communitisation of the third pillar .
it is also vitally important to support young people who are no longer in mainstream education by encouraging non-formal and informal education .
I shall let Mrs Ghilardotti speak about the general framework on behalf of my group , and I shall focus on the two other aspects , which are the revision of the 1994 Directive on a European Work Council and procedures for mergers and acquisitions .
in writing . - I abstained on this report because I desperately want people to receive the treatment they urgently need .
subject : Developments in Kosovo
for Europe &apos;s sake , I would ask that you move towards informing citizens about funding .
I call on the Member States to redefine with great care the priorities which they have and for which they intend to use the Structural Funds .
the second priority of this energy review must be putting an end to the oligopolistic structure in our energy and transport sectors .
lastly , I would also like to say that I am a little bit sad about what some speakers have said .
what impact do you expect this to have on reducing our deficit and our level of imports ?
the Danish Presidency is confident that this and subsequent meetings will help promote the close relations between Spain and Morocco .
we need to give support to the Prime Minister , Gérard Latortue , appointed by the Council of Wise Men , and the interim President , Alexandre .
because , in spite of everything , this whole instrument is still remarkably ambiguous .
a year ago , Philips was still opposed to the concept , but it is now keeping a low profile .
it was very useful for me as President of the Council to hear your observations and we will certainly take them on board in our further discussions on this topic right up until Christmas .
then the Commission said that the calculation did not work correctly in Austria .
in the drafting and adoption of technical specifications , consideration must be given to the economic costs , and care must be taken to ensure that the requisite safety standards are in place and that due account is taken of environmental and social concerns too .
this points to a spectrum of political views within the European Union .
I can say to Mrs van Bladel that the Secretary-General is looking for a better place for the chauffeurs in the new building .
perhaps I should plead guilty , Mr Poettering .
( LT ) Today in the European Parliament we have adopted the resolution on common rules for the operation of air services in the Community at second reading .
we should perhaps adopt the philosophy that Mr Cavada seems to espouse in what was an excellent speech .
I would add that the response of the United Nations Security Council , since Monday night , has been correct , and that the reaction of the European Union &apos;s Member States has also been extremely correct .
that is out of the question in a political democracy .
the growth in air traffic demands more and more guarantees of aviation safety .
horizontal services will provide targeted support .
in writing . - The Maltese public &apos;s support will also be influenced by the impact of eurozone membership on ordinary citizens , the business community and the economy itself .
why is this happening in a country which plays such a significant role in international relations and in the fight against terrorism ?
I would however raise one political point - already alluded to by Mr Musacchio - which affects all of us .
firms still write to me and ask where they can get hold of EIB funds .
in Kampuchea alone , over 35 000 people have been injured by landmines and those are the survivors .
that is , of course , as false as if one were to maintain that everything is in order .
this means that a common and universal insurance system must be set up to include all Member States and all farmers as part of a reinsurance scheme .
this Union was supposed to give a new impetus to the objectives of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation , objectives which are based on mutual recognition of common values , such as democracy , the rule of law , good governance and respect for human rights .
even if the Commission does not reflect the majorities gained in the European elections , the reappointment of reliable Commissioners gives cause for satisfaction .
secondly , I believe that the level of toll charges agreed by the Council is quite simply intolerably low .
it is therefore fitting that the Joint Parliamentary Assembly should begin to reflect on how it will adapt to the changes introduced by the next agreement , particularly in promoting increased dialogue with our development partners on such topics as peace-keeping and good governance .
the cause of this volatility can be determined to a large extent , and currently it is mainly due to the low level of reserves , which have been historically low since the winter of 1999 / 2000 . However , it is , without doubt , also due to something else which is the lack of transparency in the oil markets .
we must seek clarification on and commitment to these four central points , these four key challenges , and I believe that this report is a good instrument , a good roadmap , to help us seek this agreement .
I really cannot oblige them to remain in the Chamber until now .
firstly , the communication is part of a very complex operation , that is , the introduction of the euro , in the form of coins and notes , on 1 January 2002 .
there is a legitimate need to focus on the urban environment , and we cannot escape it , either in the area of transport or in other areas .
as far as I understand that is what we have been voting on .
however , the construction of Europe does not mean taking away from peoples and nations the scope for autonomy that enables them to control their own destiny .
pilots are trained to manage extraordinary flight conditions , the commercial airlines &apos; safety manuals are reviewed , overseen and confirmed by regulatory authorities , and airlines have the necessary experience of operating over volcanic areas , as is shown by their safety record .
from this perspective , pension and health reforms at the national level must be fair to both sexes .
today , the primary targets are immigrants of the Muslim faith .
please listen .
firstly , we have sorted out with the Swedish authorities how this regime has to be phased out .
we need promotion so that the investment will not only reduce the import of fossil fuels and reduce carbon dioxide emissions , but so that the household will realise the reduction in energy costs to them also .
developing the strategic partnership with Russia and the Ukraine is another priority of the French Presidency , which is due to host the EU / Ukraine Summit in Paris in 10 days &apos; time and the EU / Russia Summit on 30 October .
the deadline , then , is 15 January .
starting with equal treatment , which Mrs van Dijk already mentioned .
in these times of what is known as enlargement fatigue , this is a very important sign , for which I , on behalf of my group , am particularly indebted to you .
Mr President , I would like to reply to Mrs Schreyer , in a general way , on the comments we made .
the interinstitutional negotiations on the external financing instruments are about the need to ensure democratic control by Parliament over the implementation of EU legislation .
so this month &apos;s European Council will discuss energy and innovation .
we must distinguish between makeup and cosmetics that have a medicinal purpose .
what kind of signal does that send to Iran ?
Mr President , we are in the middle of the most fundamental crisis the European Union has witnessed in its history and yet almost all decisions on the strategic direction are taken at government level .
it is also a transparency problem .
we are nonetheless alert to the fact that certain amendments call upon legal cooperation and police cooperation to fall within the Community &apos; s competence and that this is incompatible with Denmark &apos; s reservation , cf. the protocol concerning Denmark &apos; s position .
our assessment has been conducted on the basis of the same Copenhagen criteria as the opinions last year .
Mr President , it is vital to cooperate across transnational boundaries on international crime , terrorism , drugs and so on .
I therefore hope that the Council adopts the following targets :
whatever the temptations to deviate from the path of constitutional legality , the fight against terrorism can only be carried on if the Rule of Law and also , above all , international agreements are respected .
finally , I should like to thank Commissioner Almunia once again for his availability , although I still think we need to have a clarifying debate with the Commissioner responsible in accordance with the specific and technical nature of the subject , and the Commission &apos;s obligation to propose a specific initiative .
do only European massacres get the European Union to move from words to deeds ?
. I abstained from the vote on the openness of Council meetings , because I feel it deals with a false problem .
in addition , we reject absolutely the inclusion of Agenda 2000 criteria in this report .
until now perhaps less weight has been given to it in relation to education .
Commission fines in antitrust cases ( debate )
as you know , Mr Scarbonchi , the decision in principle to attend has been taken .
at this point therefore , I would like to extend my express thanks to all my colleagues in the Committee on Development , the shadow rapporteurs , and the coordinators , for their constructive advice .
the ruling states that the death penalty is a legal punishment that can deter crime for the public good .
only when these conditions are met will we enable nationals of Member States to gain awareness and to give substance to this concept of European citizenship , which for many is still nothing but a hollow shell .
we are expected to wait until December 2004 to know whether or not negotiations on accession can get under way .
this is the reason why . Here is an excellent 20th century novel written in Welsh but it is only available to about 500 , 000 people throughout the European Union .
I think that last week the EU found a renewed sense of common purpose .
so in effect , the question has now been with us for many years : can we continue like this ?
the national supervisory authorities will remain responsible for supervising the use of credit ratings by these individual entities .
I assure you that we will make every effort in this direction , in collaboration with Member States .
however , these are comparatively small points and most of the amendments we accept .
two : there must be greater emphasis on Member States &apos; fulfilment of the undertakings they give regarding employment and training .
I believe in December 1997 we have made a good start , even if I suspect that the conversation will stretch many years ahead of us .
we must invest in change , invest in those affected by change , but face up to the changing world in doing so .
Madam President-in-Office , if you have compared this accession process with others , I think it must be made even clearer that this accession process is qualitatively quite different , not only because of the number of countries , the languages , the territory , the population , but also historically , because it is a far-reaching cultural opening towards Central and Eastern Europe such as has hardly been discussed before , because it is an economic and social challenge on an entirely new scale , and , of course , also because of the far-reaching foreign and security policy implications .
I am sorry that is not possible , and I know Mrs Malliori will want to speak about this .
in the future , however , increasingly fewer European citizens used – I am speaking as if the year were 2017 – postage stamps and the ordinary postal services so Mr Schmidt ’ s directive made provision for financing people who write letters by paying them the postage on their correspondence .
I would have thought that the 1996 budget would have been rather more important than the 1996 discharge but history has told us otherwise .
I would like to mention a number of points which have not been addressed in the other replies .
the Commission ’ s framework programmes for research have for many years supported pioneering work into renewable bio-resources , including plastics , agri-chemicals and pharmaceuticals .
the stock of olive trees may well be of importance to us - also an important ecological factor - but that is not enough .
that is why it is important to lay down again certain benchmarks against which we have to measure all collective claim procedures .
in paragraph 3 , the first sentence should be deleted , the rest remaining unchanged : &apos; Recalls that any redeployment that would lead ... &apos; and so on .
mass legalisation is an attempt to somehow give an untenable situation a better administrative form .
I must vote in favour because they must progress , they must have their televisions , cinemas and telephones too &apos; .
Madam President , the directive on a single permit for residence and work really is very important .
on the other hand , we cannot support the agreement being immediately repealed if it entails detrimental consequences .
it is crucial , however , for an inspection regime that is effective and credible to be established .
what a giveaway that was !
consequently , it is not possible to accept any loan requests on that basis at present .
however , this cannot be achieved without sound , good quality education .
what it is really about , of course , is not combating racism , which is scarcely of any relevance anyway , but combating freedom of expression and any policy or expression of national or European preference .
I know - because I am a member of that committee too - that the Regional Committee is seeking to promote the idea of the performance reserve .
in the Commission &apos;s periodic report for 2000 on Romania &apos;s progress towards accession , the Commission expressed its concern in relation to the legislation and practice on adoption between different countries , which allow considerations other than the best interests of the child to influence decisions on adoption .
speaking as an Austrian , I would like to point out that it was an Austrian company , OMV , that was , in 1968 , the first to conclude a supply contract with Gasprom , which has been absolutely reliable for nearly forty years .
the point of consensus is to be able to prepare a second reading of the Seventh Framework Programme scheduled for the autumn .
subsidies should be targeted to where they are most needed and an upper limit put on the size of individual payments , unless higher payments can be proved to benefit the wider rural economy or the environment .
it is a sick way in which to organise labour market legislation .
it is why you looked at the one-stop shop , the Internet , the multi-entry visas and the reduction on visas for people under 25 - I only wish I could avail myself of that privilege - and approached it by asking how we can make this work for the citizen .
I ask the Council , here and now , is this not a bad sign ?
the Member States thus have the competence to regulate on this and ensure compliance in their territory with the laws that they pass .
by moving away from the Commission &apos;s original scientific , risk-based approach to a hazard-based one , we fell at the first hurdle .
a chapter on employment in the new EU Treaty will not in fact create a single extra job , but the foundations are being laid for an active policy on employment .
we are also highlighting the fact that Eritrean refugees in the Sinai are being held hostage .
for heaven &apos;s sake why are we talking about these other targets when we are not actually moving on what we have already ?
where possible , the Commission will participate even through existing mechanisms or by recommitting dormant funds .
I agree with the rapporteur that it is unacceptable that the revised College &apos;s Financial Regulation has never entered into force and , as a result , all engagement contracts signed were illegal .
this , in addition to demonstrating solidarity , will also help to enhance Europe ’ s competitiveness , boost growth and create jobs .
the vision of Schuman has been achieved .
we are called to develop a new Europe , proud of itself and commanding the pride of all its citizens .
closure of the sitting
these actions prove the undemocratic nature of the political system and we , those MEPs who have witnessed the Communist regimes , clearly recognise the methods .
admittedly it is not an easy balancing act , but for people who are ill it may be a matter of survival .
President-in-Office of the Council . - Madam President , in conclusion , I would like briefly to reiterate our full support for the ongoing work of the ICTY as an important part of the healing and reconciliation process in the Western Balkans , now and in the future .
in my report , I support the objective of ensuring that the regulatory environment is necessary , simple and effective .
it is a democratic deficit that stems from their history .
it is quite understandable that members of the Albanian community do not want to live within the Republic of Serbia .
I welcome the work of the rapporteurs and call for the adoption of this proposal in the exact terms in which it came from the Commission and in which it was adopted in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection .
. we have today voted in favour of the report on the conclusion of the Framework Agreement between the European Community and the European Space Agency ( ESA ) in accordance with the EC / ESA agreement of 2003 .
secondly , there is a serious problem with regard to the security of stored data and the protection of the owner &apos;s identity .
we in the June List are strongly opposed to the mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo being used further to strengthen the EU ’ s common foreign and security policy .
given the aviation content here , and with due deference to the rapporteur , I can only conclude with a phrase that really will not translate from the English : &quot; What a Messerschmidt &quot; .
I always sit here .
the following questions are addressed to the Commission .
I shall simply say that the Luxembourg Presidency will do all that it can to reach an agreement on the financial perspectives before the end of June .
I already had the honour of making an explanatory statement concerning this draft budget at the part-session in September .
friends of both Israel and the Palestinians return more and more depressed from that area , as I did myself after my visit there a couple of months ago .
having the vote itself at the next sitting will not take up much time , and so I ask you , Mr President , to put it to the vote .
above all , it should not be overloaded with excessive verbiage that really has no place in a legal text which will have to be interpreted by the judges of the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg .
if no new legislation is necessary , can I urge you to look again at the existing measures and self-regulation – which I am not at all certain is accurate – and see whether they are working or whether they need strengthening ?
in the light of structural changes to international trade , it is important for the European economy to quickly implement instruments to aid workers affected by such changes , whilst also giving them the skills required for their swift reintegration into the labour market .
to close , I feel that an effort must be made to give European citizens more information about the role and powers of the European Ombudsman , so that they take fast recourse to him when their basic rights are infringed .
discrepancies of this kind prove , first and foremost , the need for the expense structure to be reformed in a way that reflects economic and social reality .
this makes it all the more important to take urgent measures in this area , including implementing restrictions and , at the same time , providing education and information .
special tax levels for employers who employ Roma women and other similar measures are more likely to have the effect of reinforcing the exclusion and counteracting integration into the rest of society .
solidarity is about the stronger helping the weaker , and what that means is that the more developed countries must give more than those that have not developed to the same degree .
another major topic was internal security .
the European Parliament cannot stay aloof .
any harmful substances already produced by the microorganisms cannot be eliminated by irradiation .
we will be monitoring very closely how the new government , still to be formed , will take reforms forward .
the consumer pays and the polluter pays , but each should pay for his own pollution and consumption rather than those of a competing mode of transport .
fourthly , its industrial base needs to be rationalised by calling a halt to the dispersal of aircraft-building across dozens of sites .
if I may , I should lastly like to thank the European Commission , Mr Kallas and his assistants for the constructive input that they never failed to contribute , the staff of the Secretariat of the European Parliament &apos;s Conciliation Committee , which showed great skill and professionalism - indispensable traits when taking important decisions on behalf of our citizens .
Mr President , the scourge of drugs and the action taken to combat it know no geographical , social or national boundaries .
the European platform on diet , physical activity and health , for example , is meant to bring about non-regulatory measures and firm commitments by the industry .
it was also accepted that a product produced or manufactured in accordance with a purchaser &apos;s requirements , and for which the purchaser supplied the necessary materials , comes under the directive .
 
how such people can reach a result that is of any use to Europe escapes me .
as many honourable Members have pointed out , the matter is urgent .
as Archbishop of Lubango , as President of the Catholic Episcopal Conference of Angola and São Tomé and of the Ecumenical Committee for Peace in Angola , you have been an apostle in the service of fundamental rights and peace and a symbol of the hopes of the Angolan people , of its desire for peace , liberty and justice .
furthermore , how can unanimity provide more thorough solutions than those on which we struggled to reach consensus ?
first of all our forensic questioning evinced from Wim Duisenberg the clarion call of his independence .
we are coordinating social security , but what we are not coordinating is the tax treatment of benefits , when benefits are increasingly being given as tax credits .
I freely admit that the government under President Berdymukhamedov has made progress .
thank you , Mr Vidal-Quadras .
Mr Berlusconi is described as Mr Putin &apos;s spokesman in Europe .
even if we manage to achieve the breakthroughs which we need in the area of democracy and maintain the tendency towards an equitable mix in the social fabric , the huge ecological question still remains .
this is three years after the regulation came into force .
now , universal service in the telecommunications sector cannot be considered an appendage to liberalisation .
on the other hand , it is true that Madagascar &apos;s economic and social situation is extremely dire , with the majority of the Madagascan population living on less than USD 1 per day .
I appeal to you to ensure that this unfortunate case , for which Václav Havel has already gone on hunger strike , is resolved under your Presidency .
I know how important this is to the German Presidency , and it is becoming urgent to coordinate our responses on immigration and asylum , for example .
rapporteur . - ( FR ) Mr President , Mr Gloser , Mr Verheugen , in only two minutes , I shall not be able to reply to everybody .
( NL ) Mr President , the Greek crisis is one of the factors forming the basis of this debate .
Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Colom i Naval for his excellent report which several other committees have contributed to .
I want to ask whether , in connection with the scenarios that have been gone through , a consensus has emerged that it will not be possible to deal authoritatively with certain types of conflict under the existing Treaty .
thank you .
just imagine what our orchestra here , this Parliament , would look and sound like if we did not have our women members livening it up with their character and informed debate .
we will not move closer to a level playing field by throwing out this directive .
I believe that this crisis , which struck my country particularly hard , proves that Parliament was right to adopt the positions we voted for here at first reading and that the representatives of the Italian , Spanish and Portuguese governments were right to abstain from the common position when it was discussed months ago , drawing attention as they did to the need to increase forest fire prevention means under this programme .
from now on we should perhaps both accept and welcome a permanent creative tension between our two institutions - that , after all , is the heart of a mature parliamentary democracy .
and having reread the fourth Annex of the Nice Council conclusions , it seems to me that this initiative , which only brings together members of the Council , does not respond to that debate , which the members of the Nice Council remind us of so insistently .
when Eurocontrol sought to find some different approaches to the ash cloud , it was not an easy decision or easy discussion because it was a matter of deciding to take enormous responsibility for the safety of aviation .
we can only try to strip Iran of international recognition , immediately block its WTO entry , impose tough diplomatic sanctions , exclude it from international sporting , cultural and social events and the Olympic Games .
we also need indicators to measure both progress and lost ground .
the Committee on Budgets voted its second reading amendments , further to the conciliation outcome , on 29 November 2007 .
ratification was approved by only one vote in the Foreign Affairs Committee .
should it really be us , the slaves of a bureaucracy elected by nobody , teaching the Swiss people about democracy ?
it is also important that the burden of proving compliance with information requirements falls on the trader .
the way in which we can solve the problem is by re-examining Frontex &apos;s mandate , and then Frontex might need more money .
curiously , some have suggested that my own role in this process was merely that of a spectator whilst others have accused me of being a power-grabbing dictator .
it is actually a relatively small amount .
in my opinion , it is very important to collect and analyse information on the use of animal health products , including antibiotic substances .
the text that has been agreed for the new directive will have a positive impact on further growth in the railways .
Mr Hyland , I am sorry to have to tell you that there is no agreement in the Council on any of these questions .
Madam President , by the time I sit down , 16 people will have died of starvation .
I also approve of the statements in the report seeking to strengthen the EU &apos;s role in multilateral security organisations , in the G8 and the G20 , among others .
ladies and gentlemen , the traceability of products and , in more general terms , intangible elements are elements that add value to products , are necessary in the fight against fraud and counterfeiting and , finally , are a vital tool in the economic and social battle awaiting us .
Commissioner , you put it very well and I fully agree with you .
today &apos;s vote does not involve any amendments , as the work on this was technically very sound and encompassed the entire political spectrum .
considering that this draft , as presented , infringes specific European directives , both the habitats directive and the wild birds directive , and also the objectives of the water framework directive , my question is this : if the final law still infringes these directives , if it is harmful to the environment , will it receive the announced EUR 1 300 billion in resources from Community funds ?
I would like to turn now to the question of the legal basis , which was discussed at our earlier conciliation meeting of 25 July .
the crucial thing that should be borne in mind now is that it cannot be excluded that those difficulties may become worse when the sheep are separated from the goats , that is to say when the countries which join the euro are separated from those which stay out .
as such , we are able to consider it acceptable to take into account other indicators that might complement these shortcomings so as to make social progress measures as complete , credible and close to reality as possible .
every MEP has the right to ask a supplementary question , and yet there seems to be no obligation on the person withdrawing the question to tell all the other Members that he has done so .
in the same letter , in which we gave this deadline of mid-February to those Member States that still have to inform us whether they have adopted or what the calendar of the adoption is , we also inform the Member States of the preparation process for the interinstitutional EGGC seminar , which , together with Parliament and the Committee of the Regions , will be held on 19 June in Brussels under the Slovene Presidency .
if we are to address this problem , we would be well advised to negotiate the chapter on customs union by 2006 at the latest and conclude negotiations on it by the end of that year , in order that this issue – which also has a bearing on the recognition of Cyprus – can be speedily resolved and that we do not end up negotiating with Turkey without the prospect of this fundamental issue being resolved .
how can we talk about competition on equal terms , when there are unequal systems of taxation ?
the Community &apos;s industrial policy in the pharmaceutical sector needs to take account of both the public health and social security aspects , without undermining the Member States &apos; powers in this field .
the rapporteur believes that we should prevent migration by investing in the countries that are the source of migration flows .
that was correct on going to print , when all the Groups in this House agreed to the resolution .
the fact is that , although the agenda has a programme structure , endorsed since Nice by the Lisbon conclusions , in particular - and which , moreover I clearly support - this initial assessment of its implementation would seem somewhat inconclusive , removed from the original plan and goals set .
only then will we receive the support of our European citizens for a truly serious policy .
in writing . - ( LT ) As is known , it is impossible to find out what export credit agencies ( ECAs ) finance or have financed in the past .
I too am concerned about diluting and weakening the European Union through too quick enlargement , although I am encouraged by progress towards monetary union ..
our group supports anything that can help bring peace to the Middle East .
let us be clear about what we are seeking from the European Employment Pact .
this new Agency will provide Member States of the EU and the European Commission with the necessary technical and scientific support in order to effectively implement Community legislation in the field of maritime safety and to prevent pollution from ships .
on that point , I stand here in a same-sex relationship of 20 years , yet my partner of 20 years would not be given the definition of family if he were to move with me to Brussels so I can do my work in the Parliament .
that is an important task of the Commission , because only then will our visa policy be accepted by our citizens .
there are three principles that we see as indispensable .
the report also proposes that a single European airspace be set up , which will make it possible to cut down on air routes , given that more direct flights will involve less gas emission .
we also believe in the principle of subsidiarity whereby decisions are to be taken as close as possible to those whom they affect .
however , there are motives which arouse a certain concern , linked to the danger of the Moldovans &apos; enthusiasm waning .
of course , I find the word ‘ Statute ’ a bit pompous .
in conclusion , implementation of the plan for Afghanistan and Pakistan is central to our future engagement in these countries .
insurance intermediaries are indeed confronted with obstacles which prevent them from taking full advantage of the freedoms of the Treaty .
applause
indeed , there is an urgent need - and that is my answer to Mrs Ţicău - to find workable solutions for bringing out-of-print works online , for dealing with the issue of orphan works ( works for which it is impossible to locate the rights holders ) .
as a medical scientist , I am convinced that the issue of an impending avian flu pandemic is a myth .
Mr President , Commissioner , clearly this is a very sensitive question , in particular having regard to subsidiarity .
I would like to highlight the outstanding significance of the &apos; Clean Sky &apos; joint technology initiative in this respect , which will make it possible for the European aerospace industry to take up the challenge thrown down to it by the debate on climate change .
furthermore , the Lithuanian Parliament &apos;s Committee on Human Rights has yet to present its conclusion on these proposed amendments .
yet in order to do that , we must act on the Grech report and increase the number of visitors per MEP .
the process of decision-making simply has to be adjusted in order to make it possible .
.
the interpretation of the draft Treaty will be vital and , if the benefits of new technologies , skills , knowledge and freedoms are to be realised by European citizens , there will have to be a political and administrative willingness to move forward .
they will make this Parliament more meaningful .
this puts the more environmentally-friendly transport methods , such as trains or buses , at a disadvantage .
they want change both inside and outside Palestine , together with the peace that is a long time coming .
the following amendments have been proposed :
the Council Presidency has made suggestions .
well , if our values are real , it is through them that we will put in place the co-operation that we want .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Laeken Declaration on the future of the European Union is a positive step towards a European Union that is more citizen-oriented and more transparent .
the European Commission has done too little research into the consequences of liberalisation for rail transport .
vaccination ended in 1991 , which has since saved European farmers over EUR 1 billion .
Lebanon ( debate )
the EU &apos;s role in this sad story shows how far we have to go if we want to change its nature as a bureaucratic establishment .
( PL ) Mr President , the debate on the vote of approval is more interesting each year , as Members of Parliament probe ever deeper into the details .
and there is no hesitation in envisaging the ceilings laid down in the financial perspective being exceeded : we do so for this year , and of course for those which follow .
it is clear to every farmer affected by BSE and foot-and-mouth and who is participating in these support measures that the EU is giving no new cause for celebration here .
the Commission will decide on the basis of the studies , after the consultation that is envisaged with the European Food Safety Authority .
we were focused and we stayed focused .
on what criteria were these people selected ?
this approach reflects the unmistakable reality that employment is the bottom line in the current global economic crisis , and that a jobless recovery is not an option .
the European Parliament has shown great interest in Baltic cooperation and issues concerning the Baltic have been debated here on many occasions .
in October this will allow us to give a response to some important problems which are still unresolved , such as the annual expenditure and its breakdown between the sums required for the purchase of IPE IV in Strasbourg , the costs connected to the new status of the Members - these proposals will have to be submitted by the working party created for this purpose by the President &apos;s Office to the Committee on Budgets by the first reading of the budget itself - the costs related to the choices that will be made regarding the status of assistants and contracting , still in progress , with freelance interpreters .
and measures which enhance and improve food quality must be supported .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the Court of Justice needs to be properly armed in order to be able to cope with the growing number of disputes , as well as its ever expanding authority .
we must make clear to our Mauritanian and Chinese friends that in carrying out fishing activity , restrictions are good .
depriving them of their dignity , treating them as objects , depicting them as being on a lower intellectual level or as capable of arousing interest solely in the sexual sphere , leads to a lack of self-esteem in unprepared persons exposed to such material .
respect peace !
as far as trade is concerned , we agree that a new WTO round is desirable , again subject to the constraints of sustainable development .
that is why I do not find it satisfactory to take only Article 95 , the internal market article , as the legal basis .
the proposal involves prolonging an ecopoints system that is currently in force and , as such , I voted for it .
I call on Members to back up their words with action .
the derogation from the rules of origin for fish processed in Papua New Guinea and Fiji is an example of this .
the economic players of European integration will not manage to create a political Europe : they cannot because many people are far too interested in creating a market Europe and not a political Europe .
there is to be no improvement in the law for all the people who fall through this particular grating .
let me just remind you that there are , at present , eighty cases pending in Austria alone , of which only two were decided by the Supreme Court .
European citizens expect us to ease business-making in the digital sphere where operations like electronic payments and e-identification should be coherent and understandable .
the loss of purchasing power that has hit ordinary people in the European Union , compounded by the drastic increases in energy prices , is a veritable impoverishment programme .
we must reduce oil consumption in energy production and especially in transport , by all means .
the introduction of a genuine common policy on fighting crime and harmonising asylum and immigration policy is needed now more than ever .
the next item is the joint debate on :
part of the reason for this is that the Member States have not yet overcome their mistrust of such Europe-wide regulations .
few question the importance of children receiving physical education at school .
Madam President , I voted against the Watson report , as did the whole of the Group of the European People &apos; s Party , not just because the amendments tabled by the group - of which I have the pleasure of being a member - were not adopted , but also because the pensioners are tired of seeing European Union territory increasingly filling up with third-country nationals who do not have the means to live .
that was the agreement with Turkey to allow the EU &apos;s Rapid Reaction Force to go ahead and have access to Nato &apos;s resources .
there are no safe ozone levels , despite what the World Health Organisation claims .
at long last , the state printing office can no longer prevent our publications .
it would also be nice to know how many of these accounts there actually are .
in light of this experience , I would therefore ask that the groups in future be given a little more speaking time in urgent debates than is currently the case .
I would go further than Mrs Frassoni .
however , regardless of whether or not the Spanish national water plan , as it stands , violates Community legislation , we are going to take a brief look at it , not only because of the effects of the planned work on LIFE areas , on fauna and flora ( and I thank the GUE / NGL group for picking up this issue from my previous questions ) but also because of many other aspects that can be seen .
however , we believe that immigration , and improved access to the employment market for immigrants , is the wrong approach .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon .
but I am talking , say , about an American professor who accepts a chair at a German university , receives a residence permit for the Federal Republic of Germany and who , when he wishes to give a guest lecture at the Sorbonne in Paris has to apply for a visa , which he is possibly still waiting for because the French or German authorities are not making progress on it . This is because of the diverse and - for the lack of a strategic plan - very heterogeneous administrative provisions in the Member States .
energetic measures are needed to counter fraud involving EU resources .
you yourself also mentioned the trans-Sahara gas pipeline , to which we must give some thought .
right now , I do not want to talk about inconsistencies .
governments cannot micro-manage enterprise .
it is high time that the safety and health of passengers , personnel and population on the ground were made the top priority .
my advice to Turkey must be : choose the future and free Akin Birdal and his colleagues .
there is a great deal for us to do , not least , as Mrs Fraisse said , in helping to create a public service in Afghanistan which will be able to deliver the sort of services we would want to see to the whole community .
I am surprised that the European Convention on Human Rights is so weak .
I do not doubt the Commissioner &apos;s best intentions regarding the budget , but to what extent will the future budget be able to meet both the food demands and the new environmental ambitions ?
I have noticed with interest and already welcomed the statement made by the French Minister for Trade and Consumer Protection , Mrs Lebranchu , who referred to the unanimous report of the Scientific Steering Committee over the weekend saying it would provide a reassurance to consumers .
we met several times with the ministers from the Group of Six , that is ourselves in Europe , the United States , Brazil , India , Japan and Australia .
your comments have been noted by the Bureau .
it stipulates that the use of the instrument does not depend on the consent of host governments .
once against , the federalist majority of the European Parliament is trying to strip the Council of its powers and transfer them to the Commission , a bureaucratic body , which is not democratically controlled .
this instruction was given purely for tactical reasons , because if this amendment had been adopted , the Group of the Europe People &apos; s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats would not have voted for the resolution .
( NL ) Approximately two years ago , the European Parliament adopted the Adamou report by an overwhelming majority .
it is something that all countries have to take responsibility for .
this is what I meant about neutrality : hearing a chorus of people repeating that the Commission is not neutral is ultimately tiresome .
that concludes the item .
Madam President , in Greece , when a priest baptises a child , he anoints the child with oil and makes the sign of the cross over it , and this , I think , shows that the identity of a Mediterranean person is very much tied up with oil .
can these worker-related measures be subsidised at the same time as the enterprise ?
in particular , delays have been detected in the process of implementing the directive , as well as considerable problems of interpretation regarding the scope of its application .
naturally , we must firmly condemn what Belarus is doing to its Polish minority , but we should also relax our policy a little more and operate a less restrictive visa regime .
but how can they be sustained if we recommend a general reduction in activity ?
however , a hastily reconvened summit and a second failure to reach agreement on a constitutional treaty would quickly plunge the European Union into crisis .
nevertheless , the Commission clearly has a problem when it comes to supervising the drafting of the implementing measures .
President Bush recently announced an initial US pledge of $ 200 million .
so , has this happened ?
it is quite clear the Western European Union is a military alliance . It believes in nuclear weapons and is committed to the nuclear deterrent .
Mr President , there have been many examples of disruption of the free movement of goods in the EU in recent years , whether for reasons of industrial action , for example the French lorry drivers &apos; blockade which caused so much damage to trans-European trade , or the more recent blockades of Welsh ports by angry farmers protesting about the ban on British beef exports due to BSE or because of falling sheep prices .
this is not just a whim .
this action by Levi Strauss can only be described as perverse , because they first organise overproduction outside the European Union precisely in order to subsequently invoke this overproduction as a major factor in deciding to make these closures .
but what you will earn is the admiration and respect of citizens , who are easily forgotten here , and you will boost your prestige in your own country .
the amount of credit taken across borders is not sufficient to justify harmonisation , but may I suggest that the European Union itself is running out of credit with citizens because it refuses to take the necessary action , through referendums , to legitimise itself ?
.
I also find particular significance in Mr Aparicio Sánchez &apos;s call for harmonization of rules in the hotel and group tour sectors .
hopefully , the reason for this is to balance these two poles of the market .
another cartel is gearing up to grab the gas market .
I have declined to endorse this report , both because this European principle has not been explicitly observed and because the European Conservatives and Reformists &apos; amendment in that regard has been rejected .
naturally such an attitude is dangerous and worrying and a growing embarrassment to Europe . That is why the Italian presidency made an oral statement in the Council , and in view of the delicacy of the issue I will give you the full details .
on the question of structural funds , the guidelines call on the Member States to increase the level of structural funding allocated to their human resource development policies .
therefore Questions Nos 62 to 114 will be dealt with in writing .
calculations showed that under these arrangements , 97 % of holdings would be wholly unaffected .
nonetheless , the response was overwhelming .
by the way , it is not always easy to make a clear distinction : was Fukushima caused by nature or by human beings ?
owing to the organisational changes in the US administration , under the new agreement the number of authorities with electronic access to PNR is greater than before .
against all expectations , Parliament is now able to decide on the statute of its Members for itself .
such was the case yesterday when the European Parliament , meeting in plenary , formally proclaimed the Charter of Fundamental Rights amid general uproar , thus ignoring the protests from the separatists demanding a referendum for the adoption of the new constitutional treaty .
– Mr President , I would like to raise the issue of the situation in the Caribbean and Florida with regard to the terrible destruction being wrought by Hurricane Ivan and indeed by the two previous hurricanes , Charlie and Francis .
we will resume it at 9 p.m.
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , for some families , this Christmas will be a period of tragedy - tragedy because of the loss of a child .
Catalonia , one of the most Europhile nations in Europe , was treated with contempt .
this explanation of vote is intended solely to highlight what we see as a reversal of priorities as regards the budget , something that this report might be said to illustrate very fully indeed .
the problem arises from the lack of generosity on the part of certain Member States towards the Union – yesterday ’ s letter is a further demonstration of that – as if the road travelled together so far were not sufficient to demonstrate that the resources granted to the European Union are resources given to ourselves , for the peace , security and well-being of the Member States .
that is what the peoples of the Arab world see .
I think it is absolutely essential – with the greatest respect for all the language regimes we operate in Europe – that we primarily give our young people knowledge of English as the language of mobility .
in this case , the Member States must do everything to try and help these refugees to leave that territory and we think that they could be accepted in European states .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction has arisen as a serious challenge in recent years , and the international community must be ready to face those challenges with conviction and to tackle them resolutely .
we ask for this to be duly corrected .
which expert , though ?
is it planning to secure the interests and existence of EU producers by setting a minimum price for milk at a level that guarantees a profit for all EU producers and puts an end to purchases below the cost of production ?
Mr President , I am speaking today on behalf of Mrs Corbey , and should like to express five comments .
not only do SMEs provide valuable employment , accounting for 80 % of new jobs in the EU in recent years , but they also play a key social role in stimulating local economies , diversifying employment and encouraging entrepreneurship .
we do not want to end up at loggerheads with the Americans again over hushkitted aeroplanes ; on the contrary , we must endeavour to regulate environmental protection and safety standards in advance , jointly and proactively .
I call on the Agriculture Council and the EU experts to approve new cereals at a faster pace to guarantee us security of supply .
there is no budget of any institution , in any Member State , that has such a tiny proportion of the overall budget , of the European Union budget .
if you belong to the Roma minority , with only a few exceptions you are socially excluded and poor , practically everywhere in Europe .
as far as outstanding problems with European security and defence policy are concerned , I called on Turkey , just a few days ago , to help achieve a constructive solution as quickly as possible .
the third package can be benefit each of the three main priorities of your presidency - energy , the economy , and Europe &apos;s eastern dimension .
however , I regret the absence of the Portuguese language in the European patent arrangements .
they must be more serious than those that failed to prevent the 1967 conflict . However , this is no longer 1967 .
this amount of rubbish does not appear within a couple of days ; it takes considerably more time .
democracy , however , is not a thing .
this was adopted by 269 votes to 208 , with 22 abstentions . The fact that the resolution was adopted by so slight a margin makes it politically weak .
since 1994 the Commission has financed worldwide approximately 30 projects , the total monetary value of which is roughly EUR 15 million .
that was months ago .
the first will be in the report that Karl von Wogau writes for us where he will look in detail at the information that comes from the European Monetary Institute and the Commission .
as a result , toxic substances were discharged into the river Umia .
the corruption endemic among officials in the Latvian Ministry of Economics and the Ministry of Regional Development and Local Government practically &apos; puts a brake on &apos; both initiatives by individuals and on any steps towards efficient application of EU financial resources .
often the information society which is now in the process of being created does not depend on what politicians do , i.e. what we do .
everything which has taken place in the Balkans in recent years , to use the words of a leading Greek poet , &apos; without caution , without shame &apos; , has been in a bid to correct one wrong with myriad other wrongs and has simply turned this Convention into a well-turned piece of literature with no teeth .
it will create new markets and enable Europe to become a global competitor in the field of technology .
it is not traditional in my country to make vodka from sugar beet .
the problem arises for those independent organizations which are fee-earning and which are partly funded by the Community budget .
they need to resist attempts to bribe them .
we are embarking on this because most chemicals are safe and we depend on them , but some must be handled with care , some are so dangerous that we need to find safe alternatives .
all the Commission initiatives were defeated in the Council , because until the Maastricht Treaty came into force , unanimity was necessary for them to be adopted .
the circumstances in your ski area belong to a class of projects in which Member States have long had to decide whether an EIA is necessary .
our citizens must be able to put their trust in the workability of legal and administrative systems and the adequacy of legal protection , irrespective of whereabouts in the Union they are travelling or are resident .
this Constitution is now dead .
however , good intentions are not enough to cope with the scourges and problems threatening our sports .
on the business in hand : more would have been better .
we are looking at outcomes .
only a very few recommend putting this to the vote in the company &apos;s general meeting .
only then will we be able to authorise the release of GMOs into the environment .
this will allow us to compensate for the fact that , unlike the United States of America , we cannot make central decisions which are implemented everywhere , but instead we must ensure that 27 Member States agree .
Mr President , I too have noticed that there has been a delay in negotiations in the Council .
the question is in which direction this Commission is heading .
we cannot have the Member States implementing the programmes while the Commission continues to bear the responsibility .
the burden of new procedures will give rise to a whole host of disputes , and the management costs will increase as a result of legal uncertainty .
thus , it is a useful report and one for which I voted , not least to reaffirm the inviolable nature of the right to abortion and the need for easy access to methods of contraception , at a time when these rights are not yet effective in all the Member States of the European Union .
promoting the free movement of people , in particular students and researchers , is a goal which is being pursued among other things by simplifying the procedure for the issue of short-stay visas in respect of which specific agreements were signed last September with the European Union ; the final goal is fully to liberalise visas in order to make freedom of movement effective , another major point of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement , and to open up channels fostering growth and education .
thank you for your response , Commissioner .
if this is the correct text , there is really no problem , in which case I would withdraw that amendment and simply ask for the German version to be adapted to what is said in the Spanish text .
the Union must make a generous gesture .
it is just that there is no need to mention these rights of jurisdiction since the area of prohibition is delimited by topography and by geographical features .
this step is also the step currently proposed by the Council .
there will already be a rendez-vous in June 2014 - five years on .
the first of these is the Flexibility Instrument .
we respect the priorities that President Obama and his new Administration have set themselves .
all trains - including high-speed trains such as the French TGV and the German ICE - should have a multi-purpose compartment to enable the carriage of sports equipment and bicycles on board .
a smoothly functioning financial market requires a balanced approach , and space for new methods combined with legislation that strengthens the interests of consumers .
the conclusion that can be drawn from the disaster in Japan is that we should not run nuclear power plants for so many years .
this is a very strong measure to be applied here , and I think we have not heard the last of the debate on this subject .
both in Estonia and in the European Union as a whole , SMEs account for 99 % of all businesses , and micro-enterprises account for 83 % of all businesses in Estonia and approximately 92 % of all businesses in the EU in total .
during its ten-year history , the euro area has created stability , low inflation and , in actual fact , millions of new jobs .
they are rather interested in the real , pure basic research that they do , which can lead on to the wonderful innovations that we can see in countries , not just throughout Europe but indeed throughout the world .
it is only for that reason that the Commission does not believe it is necessary to mention this aspect .
this is a great political choice for the European Union concerning its evolution , a choice which I want to believe constitutes a decision that has already been taken at all levels of the European Union .
we will have to invigorate the European Research Area by making new efforts to promote the mobility of the researchers , as Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca so rightly said .
we are engaged in the work of legislation , which in many fields is regulated by officials who share in the decisions .
in any event I would like this dialogue to contribute to a responsible and unfettered development of new ties and new proposals relating to our future , and to be far removed from the seductive ideological intolerance that we have witnessed on numerous occasions in European history and from which even today we are clearly not entirely immune .
we must , however , only use this instrument with great care , in a very flexible manner , and preferably infrequently , so as to avoid it becoming degraded or undergoing a sui generis inflation .
the conclusions are based on a controversial risk assessment model that was introduced by the US Environmental Protection Agency .
unfortunately this year , and this day has perhaps not been observed as it ought to have been .
the names of the signatories will be published in the Minutes of the sitting .
Mrs Jöns , we particularly value your report ’ s support for the application of the open coordination method in order to improve health care for the elderly in the countries of the Union .
on behalf of the S &amp; D Group . - ( SK ) Madam President , it is clear , first and foremost , that these companies are not only misleading , but are also fraudulent .
in 2011. the last Member States will join the Schengen area .
in essence , it is now possible to monitor the application of these rules much more rigorously than it was in 1985 .
.
as you know today 50 % of our energy supplies are covered by imports and we know that in the future the percentage will be even higher .
I actually got it in writing earlier today because they did not think we would reach Question 10 .
I think that quotas will not solve the problem of the lack of women scientists if women themselves do not wish to change this status quo .
I also hope that the House will refuse to remove the provisions banning illegal barriers for workers posted abroad to provide services .
we had asked for the final vote on the other group ’ s motion on Lampedusa to be by roll call .
Germany ?
how should we view this proposal , given the unacceptable position of the EU which , whilst claiming to be ‘ impartial ’ , insists on placing the aggressor and the victim , the colonising force and the victim of colonisation , the Israeli army and the Palestinian people on the same footing ?
after all , it is not up to Parliament to replace the Council in deciding the allocation of agricultural and fishery budgets .
in any event , Mr President , I believe that the great majority of this House is in favour of constitutionalising the process , of creating a Federation of States and Citizens .
 
we have not achieved the sort of flexibility in the financial framework that would have been necessary for good financial management .
I would be happy , Commissioner , to know at least an estimate of the necessary expenditure .
if you rule that we will not suspend the debate until tomorrow morning - and I understand that is implicit in what you are saying , though I would question it - could you a least say that the Council will reply in writing to the specific questions put by Mr Spencer on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Security and Defence Policy and that we will have that reply tomorrow before the vote ?
this circumstance , incidentally , has considerably delayed the debate on the directive at first reading as a result of a problem of competences which Parliament has taken too long to resolve .
I refer both to joint bond issuance to enable Member States to cover some of their deficits , turning a portion of their debt into European debt and facilitating the obtaining of loans with low interest rates , and the tax on financial transactions .
why do I , or my colleagues in the Legal Affairs Committee , see a connection between these things ?
this is worth doing for the new accession states themselves and for the Union .
the next summit in Cologne , which the German Presidency must prepare , must not end in further disappointment .
if the people responsible for leading other countries do not unfortunately feel the same , we must seek the best way to operate in those circumstances .
in approving the legislation on the structural funds one of the Council &apos;s priorities was that these funds should be used to combat unemployment .
in fact , having denounced the irregularities of the campaign , demanded the postponement of the second round and withdrawn its observers , it does not seem consistent that it should remain silent with no further reaction or sanctions , contenting itself in reality with merely condemning the situation .
debates on cases of breaches of human rights , democracy and the rule of law ( announcement of motions for resolutions tabled ) : see Minutes
since the treaty of the European Union came into force , the delegation of two of the members of the Council has on thirty occasions been made up exclusively of one or several regional Ministers .
and , finally , there is hypocrisy .
firstly , on equivalence : postponing our decision on equivalence will not only ensure that EU markets remain open while work on convergence is ongoing , but will also allow us to work actively with United States and other third country authorities towards the elimination of reconciliation requirements for EU issuers abroad .
conditions in Zimbabwe are now spiralling out of control .
secondly , we must also bring about real worker participation , which will in any case involve the evaluation of the 1994 European Directive in which this is enshrined .
applause
organized crime is a global phenomenon and therefore on a European level requires a response from the Council of Europe .
in that light , the position of the Commission is essential , as is the position of the European Parliament , as indeed is our determination , even our fervour , and the fervour with which we shall seek - or at least we can hope- to impose our point of view on the Intergovernmental Conference .
in our common market we are at the mercy of others , and Mrs Graenitz &apos; observations are mostly quite justified .
we have founded the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control , the ECDC , in Stockholm in good time to ensure that we are equipped for our coming tasks .
my criticism lies elsewhere .
the European Union offers its support to that end .
it is illogical to be dismissive about people fleeing Iraq or Afghanistan , implying that they are undeserving scroungers , when by common agreement the regimes of those countries are deemed brutal and depressive , and even deserving of military attack .
the present situation demands that we should create a starting point that prevents such conflicts arising in the long run .
taking this into account , Russia has invited all EU leaders to this special summit , which should serve to deepen our bilateral cooperation with Russia even further .
in Feira it is precisely consumer confidence that is being identified as a key factor for the development of e-commerce .
in it they say &quot; we pray at your end , honourable European Parliamentarians , that justice may prevail on us &quot; .
as elected representatives of the people we are responsible for seeing that all possible measures are taken , because our citizens do not like criminals to be enjoying freedom of action , when Europe &apos;s freedoms do not lead to more security for the citizen himself .
following the debate on the report by Mrs Klaß we shall hold a debate on the report by Mrs Handzlik on the internal market in the new Member States , initially scheduled for the votes .
the most important EU matters must not be scuppered by domestic issues !
maritime transport is an important means of transport within the European Union as well , and on that basis I welcome the initiative to establish a single maritime transport space without barriers .
it is an extremely important debate that Commissioner Patten is drawing to our attention here .
I would therefore depart from the position adopted by the Group of the European People &apos; s Party and European Democrats .
Parliament cannot and must not take political opinions or compromises into account when dealing with as technical a subject as additives .
with your permission I should like to simplify matters by basing my replies on two main sets of comments , dealing with the progress of convergence and the preparations for the introduction of the euro , which will be completed on time .
can the Council guarantee that demonstrators who were arrested and identified , but are not suspected of any criminal offence , will not be registered in the SIS ?
it is not a particularly important discussion , as the Employment Guidelines contain every opportunity for action .
what lies behind our position on the amendments proposed in relation to jurisdiction ?
but now , thanks to the Commission &apos;s decision , we shall not know whether the soya beans are produced normally or genetically modified , because the labels won &apos;t tell us , because that isn &apos;t allowed .
the south east of England was one of the regions first hit by the foot and mouth outbreak in the UK .
I would therefore ask , since I am sure you still remember this whole yes and no business yesterday , that the records be corrected .
but the reference is to legally recognised organisations , NGOs , with which all of us are familiar .
secondly , I would like to mention package tours and tour operators .
they and we are equally afraid that , particularly when it comes to vertical restraints on competition , it really is extremely difficult to define market share in this context , because of the problem of networks , which eliminate competition between brands and create barriers to market access .
we believe that the stated legal basis for the current regulation is mistaken .
by the way , it amazes me that some members , as was the case with Mr Verhofstadt just yesterday , are advocating an investment strategy while being content with this package .
the President has been asked before that something be done about this .
did it help to improve health service provision in underdeveloped countries , or did it not ?
relating to Tuesday :
I believe this is an absolutely essential and fundamental subject for the future of the European Union .
as regards energy , world trade is not only distorted by protectionism , but also by energy price support mechanisms .
I hope and believe that they will remain like that in future .
. Mr President , for many years the International Civil Aviation Organisation has been looking at market-based options designed to limit aviation emissions and introduce the aircraft and operating practices that are best environmentally .
at the same time , there is the difficulty that so many different spheres of activity are involved .
of course , the assassin , the radical , the extremist , who reject all prospect of - I was going to say peaceful - discussion , must be excluded from the debate , even if that offends them .
of the various amendments presented , I agree with Nos 1 , 2 and 3 , both because of the characteristics or nature of the benefits in question , or because of the conditions for receiving them , or the difficulty or impossibility of controlling them .
rather than the asylum system , it would then be the immigration system that would guarantee the best ticket into the European Union .
regrettably , the budget line for minority languages is not included here as yet .
wrongly , because the external implications of EMU will have important consequences for both the EU and for our direct partners , as well as for the entire web of international economic monetary relationships .
this is never related to the length of the journey , but we should be absolutely rigid with regard to standards and compliance with them .
there is no doubt that we need to hold discussions with local players and fishermen , regarding the amendment and simplification of measures that are sometimes too complicated .
Mr President , I would urge the Council to look into its own heart and say to its own members : friends , what can we do ?
I think a very broad majority of the House could endorse that , Mr Soulier .
it needs to operate within a large-scale European network instead of just within the individual Member State borders .
it is a little later than it might have been , but that is because there has been a full external evaluation and a full consultation of all stakeholders , which has informed the Commission ’ s proposal and indeed the recommendations from the Council .
nuclear accident in Japan
in order to make everyone happy , let me assure you that these proposals do not increase costs by one single euro .
this kind of policy has not been adopted in Spain or other places , and in some countries , how to react to illegal immigration is being considered .
I have to say to the rapporteur that I was most impressed by the fact that an Irish case is cited there .
in writing . - ( FR ) In seeking to regulate conflicts of law and jurisdiction regarding succession and wills , the European Parliament has for once refrained from encroaching on areas for which national governments have sole responsibility .
ladies and gentlemen , it is the duty of anybody that , like the European Union , is responsible for handling these kinds of sums , to impose stringent supervision of the projects that are supported and to vigorously combat waste .
that in my view is the best kind of assistance and it is the wisest use of our taxpayers &apos; money .
racism is on the rise again .
that is why I and many people of my generation especially admire the extraordinary efforts of the peoples of the Czech Republic , Estonia , Hungary , Latvia , Lithuania , Poland , Slovakia , Slovenia and Romania and Bulgaria to fight for democracy , and how they relate the very idea of Europe to that of democracy .
the Slovenian Presidency has given the Western Balkans special attention .
you cannot feed people when there is not enough food being allowed in .
sustainable development cannot be achieved without developing new environmental technology and innovations , especially in the transport and energy sectors .
1 . An extensive and rigorous system of registration for chemicals in order to recognise them , to evaluate their risk , to give information about them to users and to avoid those that are harmful .
Mr President , Commissioner , I shall deal specifically with the Collins report .
for Latvia that would mean a trained workforce leaving the country , and for the EU it would mean a problem of cheap labour .
fortunately , there are also a number of positive elements to report , including target goals for drinking water and sanitary facilities , chemicals , fish stocks , the fight against poverty , hunger and child mortality .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , that is why I cannot wait to hear about new agreements for new consistent policy .
the Sainjon report is an excellent piece of work .
to strengthen confidence , we must not only communicate better but also be more efficient in the sectors to which the European Union is already committed .
against this background , a broad majority of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy supported this report and the promotion of 3G .
by way of clarification I should say that I think it is a step in the right direction because now we are no longer discussing the issues which concerned us five days ago .
thirdly : we have learned that we need to be independent from our American friends if we want to control the means to be deployed in a military conflict .
as Mr Weber , the President of the Court of Auditors , said , the Court submits a statement of assurance concerning the &apos; legality and regularity &apos; of expenditures , obligations , pre-accession strategy expenditure , administrative expenditures and common agricultural policy expenditures that are part of the Integrated Administration and Control System .
perhaps the time will come when internal markets will have developed to the extent that there is a need for a European self-regulatory body , but I do not believe that time has yet come .
we agree with the need to guarantee respect for criteria relating to effectiveness , efficiency , rigour and transparency &apos; in all the phases of Structural Fund programming and implementation &apos; .
the same is true for paragraph 10 , and this is important for the Council as well .
in this sensitive area , especially , we should not become entangled in contradictions and so weaken the demands we make on other countries .
the substance of the Treaty must be implemented .
it has already started and it is sure to continue .
what works outstandingly well in the small democratic structure that is the canton of Appenzell , will not work in the same way in a Community with half a billion inhabitants .
that is the question .
moreover , I understand this wish .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would be happy to answer the questions .
the next item is the report ( A4-0145 / 98 ) by Mrs Estevan Bolea , on behalf of the Committee on Research , Technological Development and Energy , on the communication from the Commission to the Council , the European Parliament , the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on a Community strategy to promote combined heat and power ( CHP ) and to dismantle barriers to its development ( COM ( 97 ) 0514 - C4-0596 / 97 ) .
this is because the Czech Republic does not feel that the proposal for a regulation is a necessary measure for the proper functioning of the internal market .
it is precisely because of that concern of looking rapidly and in detail at the petitions that have been submitted to us , that I will only speak briefly about the Evans report .
in conclusion , we must reappraise the proposals in Agenda 2000 for Europe &apos;s beef sector and , in the context of world trade talks , provide a greater degree of protection and opportunity for Europe &apos;s beef farmers .
I would like to congratulate Mrs Hulthén on this .
this is the field where we need to concentrate our action a little more .
as you are aware , he was not provided with sign language interpretation at his trial .
however we would also like to see the private commercial world demonstrating greater joint responsibility with regard to the employment of women .
until the end President Pflimlin impressed us with the vigour and clarity of his message , which is still highly relevant to us all .
two types of measures can be identified in the &apos; seven point plan &apos; presented by the Commission to deal with this crisis .
the Commissioner also more than hinted , of course , that a lot of consideration was being given to bringing the whole issue of the Danish early retirement pension scheme before the Court of Justice in Luxembourg , specifically on the grounds that the scheme actually discriminates against non-Danish wage earners who are unable to fulfil the conditions , due to the fact that they have not been in paid work for the period required under the Danish system .
if we would really like to have a stronger voice in our talks with China , we need to remain absolutely united with a clear set of rules , not 27 different markets , and also to follow very much enforcement .
initiative reports will have to take second place ; legislation needs to come first .
this is a very technical file and , as you are aware , technical conservation measures in the Baltic Sea presently originate in large part from fisheries rules adopted at international level in the International Baltic Sea Fisheries Committee – IBSFC .
( applause )
it should be pointed out that in the common position , the Council has tightened up the conditions for the granting of dispensations by introducing the &apos; critical load &apos; concept , which I think we can all find acceptable .
the fact that the expression &apos; ... hold the ECB to account &apos; in paragraph 5 seemed to many members of my group to be too strong remained unresolved .
I still have before me a completely blank sheet .
these agreements must promote the exchange of knowledge , via the use , especially , of global information technology networks .
this is simply unacceptable , and we must fight against it .
thirdly , it should be standard practice for the Council of Ministers to decide by majority vote on Community legislation ; unanimity should only apply in exceptional cases , and even where unanimous decisions are still prescribed by the Treaty they should be phased out within a fixed period of time .
if market research findings are correct , i.e. that about 80 % of the population reject these products , then they will not be successful , and so they will automatically be withdrawn from the market .
Madam President , I fully sympathise with the concerns of the European Parliament over the gravity of the situation in Chechnya .
no one in Europe can understand this more than post-communist countries which are still under the influence , the huge influence , of Russia .
the report also rightly states that these ILO Conventions should be applied at Community level .
the global liberalisation process is the main threat to European alcohol producers .
( the speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
in this case it was possible , but in many cases it is not .
I experience this as a slap in the face of the Commission and Parliament .
the changes are , of course , beneficial in themselves , not just as a prerequisite for EU membership .
not only that , but each and every aspect of this report duly sets out another attempt to interfere with commercial activity .
we must pay great attention to these matters .
he has misled the British people and they see it live on their television screens .
in formal terms , however , this must be dealt with within the legal and institutional frameworks .
( Loud applause ) Mr President , I do however wish to comment on the Minutes as yesterday evening during the night sitting , as rapporteur for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy , I presented its recommendation for second reading of the regulation on the statistics on trade in goods between Member States .
the multifunctionality of the rural regions can thus be strengthened and increased .
the clear report by Mr Väyrynen underlines the importance of the EU &apos; s relations with its future neighbour , Ukraine .
all of us regularly pass the room where this exhibition took place and which now bears his name .
what is meant by the words - and I will quote them in English because I have the English edition : Member States shall specify which small retail businesses shall be permitted to defer application of this Directive ?
Commissioner , how is it that abusive action by a Director General of the Commission can paralyse the LEADER II programme , just because of problems raised by LEADER I ?
along with the migrants who come to EU countries legally , however , in accordance with their laws and regulations , there are many illegal migrants , who are often exposed to discrimination or even persecution , as employers frequently take advantage of their lack of a legitimate residency status .
well , in 2010 I was in a Chinese restaurant and I had a very good meal .
( EL ) Madam President , I , too , consider that the Court is wrong to find that having a crucifix in schoolrooms is tantamount to disrespect for other people &apos;s religious faith .
as a result , this week the Council agreed to suspend negotiations on a number of key chapters .
it is , of course , important for competition between airports not to have any adverse effects on the people who live in the vicinity and on the environment . I believe that this is a factor of importance and that is why we need European regulations in order to prevent competition between the different airports .
President of the Commission . - I repeat that we have used to the full our existing instruments .
because it is not simply a question of discussing whether the Structural Funds are maintained for some and not for others , but rather of finding out , firstly , how we can all contribute , and the President of the Commission has recently talked about the suitability of a European tax .
the European left tried to take sole credit for the idea of taxing financial transactions .
so at this stage we need to lay down a few basic principles and priorities for the future CFP .
this is an important commercial consideration that must be borne in mind .
however , egotism has a tendency to get in the way of the dynamism that drove the fathers of Europe .
Mr President , ever since its entry into force in 1975 , the Washington Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species has proved to be a valuable instrument , indeed the only one based on ecological rather than commercial criteria to have had a positive effect .
of course we said , as long ago as 1993 , that the industry still had almost ten years .
so if , by a mini-treaty , as presented by the new French President , we mean the constitutional compromise and the Charter of Fundamental Rights , it will be a yes , a yes to a Foreign Minister .
the purpose of this high level group will be to contribute to the process of implementing industrial and commercial policies in the textiles and clothing sector of the enlarged Union .
I believe that the guidelines offer the flexibility that Member States need in order to draw up those programmes .
Mr President , Mr Karas deserves our admiration .
in my own country , it is close on zero per cent , and I think that what we have noted in recent years in the EU &apos; s accounts reflects the fact that common funds are not handled so carefully and meticulously as money which the States regard as their own .
the work done by the Commission and by the other European institutions cannot consist in re-inventing the wheel each year .
I believe that it is advisable to give the importing authority the right to issue its own certificate on the aeronautical product , thus preventing the duplication of assessments carried out by the exporting authority .
ladies and gentlemen , I disagree fundamentally with that assessment of the situation .
this is an important forward step in that it has involved us analysing the vital measures to be taken at European level in relation to those countries whose vehicles also travel on European roads .
 
in Hamburg there is a bottleneck , the fixed-link Fehmarn Belt crossing has been cemented , the two Alpine tunnels that have just been completed in Switzerland are being ignored and the bridge across the Messina road is intended to be a European project .
- The complexity of the IGC process inevitably requires a complex response from the European Parliament .
the India-EU Summit in December came out with a strong commitment expressed by both sides to conclude the negotiations as soon as possible .
amongst the concrete measures envisaged we also incorporate the harmonisation of operative requirements , the common use of capabilities , the possible acquisition of those capabilities via a European arms agency , which unifies or at least coordinates the existing ones , the study of an accounting system more suited to reality , which facilitates the long-term funding of certain systems and also the search - as I said before - for new common funding formulas .
how can we help renewable energy ?
may I just point out that we are talking about the future of the Union , in preparation for the European Council , and only one group leader is present in this Chamber : Mr Poettering .
Europe cannot , therefore , fail to take an interest in it .
however , poverty is not a good accompaniment to progress .
conscious of the fundamental importance that 2011 will have for the success of the future of the Union , and the challenge that this poses to the European Commission , and in a general way to the Union as a whole , I am voting in favour of this draft resolution .
the framework agreement between the partner countries of the 1993 general agreement on Central American integration forms an important cornerstone of this cooperation .
for our part , and as far as possible , we will all continue to stand by Moldova &apos;s citizens and provide the necessary external support to reforms .
in this way we can monitor with greater accuracy the costs associated with different policy areas , how administrative expenditure relates to operational expenditure , as well as general efficiency .
I have learnt that it is not a question of imposing programmes or policies , but of taking up these proposals and programmes for the good of humanity .
our message to our partners is that we are solidly behind our negotiating leaders in Seattle - as solidly as the European Alps , I would say .
I should like to reassure Mrs Pack that the Chair &apos;s acknowledgements are a proper and institutional token of respect for rapporteurs and the opinions that they express , even when we are completely at odds with their content .
I refer for example to the potential financial implications of agricultural reform or of the adoption of the adjustment of the financial perspectives .
– Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , I think we should subject everything that happened last weekend to a very sober analysis .
I voted for the European Parliament motion for a resolution on the mass atrocities in Jos , Nigeria .
when the Commission sends the Council a proposal for a common position , this is also sent to the European Parliament for information .
however , Commissioner , we know that we always have a number of deadlines : for the budget , the price package , the set-aside rate , etc .
let me also respond to the criticisms that have been made of the Constitution .
he has dealt with the technical details , and for that reason I need hardly reiterate these .
services in these areas must therefore be governed by the imperative of socially effective delivery without being subjected to the pressure of competition .
I welcome the Council &apos;s statement that &apos; ... all genuine efforts to separate the fight against terrorism from the search for political solutions ... &apos; must be made , but my problem is that the Council does not say that efforts of that kind are conspicuous by their absence at the moment in Turkey .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in our opinion , this report takes us in quite the wrong direction .
when it comes to today &apos;s debate , first of all I want to say to the Council , yes , a solution was reached at this Council .
the present Commission ’ s term of office is coming to an end , and that of a new Commission will begin .
the directive is of fundamental importance , since at a time when we can live and move freely within the territory of the European Union , it is important for a citizen to be able to understand , in circumstances as difficult as the commencement of criminal proceedings , what is happening to him or her and be able to make himself or herself understood .
the coordinators might then form a body of their own , consulting among themselves and using best practice methods and benchmarking to achieve progress .
one amendment in particular was absolutely essential and central in our view , for the Commission had proposed that Member States could be granted derogations almost at will .
the debate is closed .
the Commission has been able to reaffirm its attachment to the Doha declaration on the TRIPS agreement on public health and its support for the flexibilities contained therein .
I would now briefly like to refer to two questions that have been raised .
there is also a debate surrounding the question of whether European businesses should perhaps not only report on the social and environmental standards which they apply within Europe , but also on the social and environmental standards which they apply when they invest abroad .
I want them to bring justice to the Muslims , the Uigurs in Xinjiang .
that is why information on environmental pollution must be made public .
the fact is that there has been an increase in unwanted pregnancies among young women , and even young girls , but we cannot allow unrestricted abortion to be put forward as a solution to this problem , because the fact is that the ultimate objective of this own-initiative report is to introduce unrestricted abortion and the morning-after pill into the legislation of the Member States of the European Union and the candidate countries as an effective means of combating unwanted pregnancy .
the quotas are higher this year than previously because of a joint contribution in this area .
we call on the peoples to step up their fight against the European Union and the new bonds which it is trying to impose on us through the ‘ Euro-constitution ’ .
as you have gone this far , why not the Taliban , Hezbollah or the Tamil Tigers ?
I would like to address a question to you , one that , although it has no connection with the Guinness Book of Records , does indeed have to do with what may be the world &apos;s longest waiver of immunity proceedings .
we defend the concept of &apos; needs-based &apos; humanitarian relief .
so neither Parliament nor the European Union has any powers to regulate the constitutional position of the European political parties .
another special area is the stimulation of intergenerational solidarity .
second , many more are being over-exploited on a global basis .
as you know , the target set was 20 % of energy use through renewables .
of course , if Bashir refuses , then he should be prosecuted with the full force of international law .
yet , the people of Europe are familiar with the Union &apos;s shortcomings and expect real political decisions from their leaders , not just the kind of talk that promises a great deal , but delivers little .
this cooperation represents an initial stage in the implementation of other possible forms of cooperation , specifically in the light of the deliberations taking place on the forthcoming Commission Communication on border management , as well as the result of the feasibility study carried out by the Italian authorities with regard to the creation of a European border police service .
Mrs Prets has suggested that the Union should sponsor radio or television programmes .
because , whilst it is true that some companies - which we know about - have been unable to cope with the competition from the developing countries , we should also point out that some of them were , to some extent , operating obsolete businesses and that imports have merely accelerated a process that was inevitable .
ladies and gentlemen , I therefore ask you to show solidarity with these women and call on the Portuguese National Assembly to address the problem of illegal abortions , and abolish the legislation that convicts these women .
however , the main issue is : does the proposal in front of us actually achieve that ?
there must be balance between the different types of human rights , the pillars , as mentioned by Mr Verheugen , and the institutions .
nor can we expect the Americans to do everything - their elections mean , in any case , that they are less capable of acting in this area .
now , that is harmonisation I would go along with .
of particular concern are grievances voiced regarding freedom of the media and freedom of assembly and of association .
this action coupled with the rumours of the private deal to shorten the term of the first ECB President must seriously undermine confidence in the markets and the wider world .
( HU ) Since I am going to speak Hungarian , my mother tongue , instead of the standard Roma term I will use the word Gipsy , which has no pejorative meaning in my language and it is also used in our Constitution .
the manufacture will take place in accordance with the regulation applicable in each of the countries .
( the speaker agreed to take a blue-card question ( Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
that also means that we will finally get away from one-sided development .
in my country , Lithuania , it was found that milk processing companies agreed on raising prices .
I have just one or two points to make .
I believe that this really is an important project for the future .
the Galician , and therefore , European citizens need to feel supported in the long and difficult journey into which the negligence of their own ministers has thrown them .
I said that I was encouraging all the steps taken by the Italian government to satisfy the convergence criteria , and that I was not prepared to speculate at that time but that it was a major step in the right direction , which is what we hope for .
some countries have not complied with these requirements .
on the one hand , unfettered commercial activity , as we all know , can destroy the environment .
we therefore need a new Kyoto which will be signed by these three countries , which together account for half the population and 65 % of the energy .
if we do that , we will not always need to call for more and more budgetary resources , but will be able to use the budget to produce modern policies for the future .
this was to be expected .
as our Group has pointed out , Parliament ’ s report sets in stone some of the worst aspects of the agreement reached by the Council on the same proposal , such as the removal of the ‘ super safe country ’ concept , which is criticised by the United Nations Commission for Refugees , and the possibility of appeal in the event of an asylum application being refused and the applicant being allowed to remain in the country until the appeal process has been completed .
that is the directive that is before us this morning and on which we will be voting later on today .
it clarifies and upgrades the role of BAT reference documents ( BREF ) in the application of legislation .
there are , indeed , positive signs .
the Council shares the concern expressed by the honourable Member and by Parliament as a whole in relation to the quality of life and especially the mobility of disabled citizens .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the question of services of general interest is one of the themes for discussion within the context of the Intergovernmental Conference .
the good old international community , despite its meddling in terrorist laws and rapid reaction forces , has done nothing to ban depleted uranium weapons .
Madam President , economic union will change Europe , it will create an orderly political framework for the internal European financial market and it will also pave the way to political union .
Mr President , much of what is contained in these five reports is good , which is of course the result of the fact that we socialists won the votes in the economic affairs committee .
many Member States , including Lithuania , are suitable candidates for other funds , which require less cofinancing and bureaucracy .
we are now at a time in the European Union when we can say &apos; back to work , Europe &apos; ; let us go back , let us work , let us operate .
the Commission considers that the resolution is partly incoherent with the interinstitutional agreement and partly goes beyond the agreement .
there is no doubt about it .
does not the Commission even specify that &apos; the relevant applicable law is the law of the Member State where the EPC has its registered office , which applies to private limited-liability companies &apos; ?
we know , however , that these regulations exist at national level , as well as at European level , and fragmented infrastructures and rules predominated until recently .
the EU is gradually giving away its trump cards here by acting rather like an arrogant superpower .
the Group of the European People ’ s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats therefore endorses the proposal to extend the Council Regulation on the European Agency for Reconstruction .
I believe that the case of the workers from Nokia GmbH , in the German region of Bochum , justifies European aid , as was previously given in Portugal .
this inability to handle even the most narrow and qualified criticism can be seen in the reaction to the censure motion on which we have just voted .
the task of fine-tuning the text by pointing out the unclear points is now the responsibility of Parliament .
of having said exactly the same thing a few months beforehand , namely that it was up to historians to study the issues relating to the Second World War , whatever the views of some of my French fellow Members , who set themselves up as the thought police , going so far as to exert unacceptable political pressure so that Mr Gollnisch ’ s request for defence of immunity will be rejected .
for these reasons we have abstained .
we are talking about the Stability Pact , but while we are arguing numbers , fractions and decimal points , there are developments taking place in the political arena which I feel give cause for concern .
however , we do come up against the Court ruling in the Altmark case , which brings us to the fourth criterion .
let me now answer some of the questions raised by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf .
obviously , not everything is satisfactory , but an international agreement must be judged in overall terms .
the European Union has a rigorous policy on aviation security , but that does not include a no-fly list .
it should therefore not be possible to patent any human body-part . Most particularly , the cloning of humans , modification of their germinal genetic identity and the use of human embryos should not be patentable .
the aim of this conference was to bring together representatives of industry , animal welfare organisations and public authorities and to conduct a discussion on animal welfare and ethics .
it is very powerful and very well organized ; it is now an international and transnational phenomenon that uses far more effective means than the obsolete means of our small Member States of the European Union , and I would also say outside the European Union .
as Mr Medina Ortega said , this reminds us very much of the labours of Sisyphus .
if a Community instrument were to impose such a duty on Member States , it would conflict with the principle of subsidiarity .
the opposition of the Polish Government has a dubious legal base with respect to Community law and shows Poland in an unfavourable light in relation to foreign investors .
should not the United States be encouraged to make a settlement with Cuba over compensation for nationalized properties as other states , including those in Europe , have done ?
we do not need to put any more mud into the water .
I would have preferred Kosovo to have been part of it , but at least we have ensured that there will be a start to visa dialogue with the objective of visa liberalisation .
enough to relieve Europe .
14 million people in Europe are still unemployed - a gigantic waste of financial resources and an insult to human knowledge and ambitions .
there are increasing signs that the most underdeveloped regions are still finding it difficult to break out of the poverty cycle .
the last question concerns the future of this sector .
we therefore call on the Member States to establish a tax system that is reoriented to encourage all the parties involved to behave in a more environmentally responsible way .
I believe that all European drivers should be able to choose their spare part supplier in the interests of fair competition .
as the turn of the century approached , growth was becoming quite marked , and expectations of a strong economic recovery were high .
in particular I welcome the steady progress that has been made on financial services , IFRS and the broker / dealer agreement .
we are aiming in this study at obtaining an objective , well-founded and evidence-based analysis of the issue .
we are therefore not looking at mass transfer of such data ; the objective and the subject place very clear bounds on that transfer of data .
diabetes has also become a commoner phenomenon , as has cardiovascular disease .
much more needs to be done to counter growing unemployment and poverty and I abstained to demonstrate my deep dissatisfaction on this score .
.
very rarely have I seen reports on energy of this calibre .
we must take this opportunity seriously and base our actions on these acquired institutional reforms .
I am confident that the new Northern Dimension policy , with its future shared ownership by the European Union , Russia , Norway and Iceland , will substantially benefit the Baltic Sea region because none of the challenges faced by the Baltic Sea can be tackled without genuine Russian involvement , just as none of the challenges faced by the Barents Sea can be dealt with without Russia and Norway .
therefore , at a time when Europe should be beginning extensive work to identify the Arianes and the Airbuses of 2050 , the Commission has to realise that , with the crisis , the rules put in place are no longer suited to today &apos;s economy .
only by means of an open and honest investigation and through justice can the Sri Lankan people heal the wounds of a long and difficult conflict and continue their lives in peace .
compared with a company-employed driver , this is unfair competition .
 
in 2005 , the leaders of the rich world met at the G8 Summit in Gleneagles and undertook to double annual aid to poor countries to USD 50 billion , and to give 100 % debt cancellation .
it is a prototype for a much more far-reaching arrangement than the present one .
in 2009 , we also extended the maturity of our longer-term refinancing operation to one year .
clearly , I understand your arguments and those of the Council , but when I compare what has been proposed and the report on Central Asia - which we voted in favour of in this very House a few months ago , on 20 February 2008 and in which we repeated our demands concerning the release of prisoners , the Red Cross , and so on - has there really been any progress ?
I believe that we must vigorously condemn the abuse of power .
if not , when do you expect this report ?
because the way in which direct aid is distributed benefits large farm holdings at the expense of small farms , thereby constantly increasing the income differential between rich and poor farming regions and between large , capitalist-style holdings and small , family-run farms , because the way in which direct aid is distributed is helping to wipe out small holdings and because the Commission proposal makes no attempt to get to the nub of the problem , the members of the Community Party of Greece will be voting against the Commission proposal and the parliamentary report .
they provided me with a point of reference in designing , assessing and approving buildings .
premium , high-speed , high-quality services have opened up new markets at premium prices .
as I said , we sent it as an Article 133 document to the INTA Committee .
I am very pleased that parallel trade has been retained .
we all now expect great achievements in Copenhagen , although it must also be emphasised that this is to be an international event .
the report also fails to consider the potential wealth of knowledge that those over 65 possess and the trend on the labour market to keep more and more people in this category involved in the employment process . In some countries , the underlying aim is for these people to continue to pay contributions so that there is enough money to pay pensions to the growing numbers of older people .
I think that for the future we need a strong and clear mandate .
the vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
this has been the endeavour of the past few months and this is the type of Commission which has been introduced to you .
I am seeking to combat fiscal dumping and social dumping simultaneously . That is why I sometimes encounter problems with the leaders of certain Member States .
it seems quite extraordinary that we should be putting the marginal price of energy lower than the initial price , and thereby encouraging consumption when surely we live in an age when we want to encourage conservation and efficiency and make it more expensive to consume more .
I voted in favour of this recommendation for second reading , which is the fruit of a compromise between the Council and Parliament .
so let us allow each country to determine its own accession timetable , according to its own efforts .
take a look at Japan , where this policy was applied and where it does not work .
this is the crossroads of both your presidency priorities .
however , the Commission is evidently not following a coherent approach , since on the one hand it has not finalised the international agreement with Australia , while on the other hand it is ready to negotiate with Canada on standards that are entirely different from those which apply to the US .
the construction of these vessels , the use of double hulls , their age , their control by classification companies , insurance , the creation of databases containing all relevant information , Community cooperation and coordination , the reinforcement of control by inspectors and the liability of carriers and owners of cargoes are all issues which must be tackled . Who better than the European Commission to make serious proposals for European harmonisation in these areas ?
rapporteur . - ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I too would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs and would just like to draw attention to two points .
in it , he outlines a realistic path to a European defence responsibility , knowing very well on the basis of his expertise as a general that military action is always embedded in everything that is needed by way of civil action before and after .
his absence from these meetings would have deprived us of certain opportunities to defend the priorities that you outline here .
it must no longer be kept in check by the banks and speculators which everyone is complaining about .
( DE ) Madam President , as an ardent pro-European - as are the great majority of my 500 000 direct voters - I find it very difficult to accept this predicament that you have placed yourself in .
I would like to add one comment and one answer .
the debate is closed .
in conclusion , as regards the petition by Mr Peter Downs in Ireland on the safety of riding helmets , I want to urge the Commission to come forward now with a progress report on the issues raised .
my group has re-tabled a number of amendments , confirming for some the exclusion of health services from the Services Directive and clearly endorsing , for others , the need for specific legislation , while highlighting the fact that a number of regulations already exist , not least Regulation ( EC ) No 883 / 2004 , on the basis of which mobility and the reimbursement of a number of health services take place .
as you will all agree , this programme is not only another piece of legislation ; it is a significant signal to Europe &apos;s freight businesses that we can , and indeed we want , to help rather than hinder them .
however , when we speak about reform and change we are speaking about reforming our economy and making it more competitive .
otherwise you will find it difficult to represent the 60 to 70 % of Czechs and Moravians who do not want to deal on unequal terms with Europe , but who do want to live in Europe in a normal way .
the Council simply passed the buck back to the Commission and its answer showed a total indifference to the problem and no concern at all to ensure that EU law is enforced .
because there is clear scientific evidence that the hake stock is at present considerably over-fished , a number of measures have been proposed by the scientific advisers in this area .
sadly , the authorities often turn a blind eye to this , in the same way that they turn a blind eye , or two blind eyes , to the other unlawful activities perpetrated by certain parties who do not pay taxes and who are not fully integrated into our society .
I would like to ask the Commissioner whether he is aware of the extreme impracticality of the manual tagging of individual sheep , and its maintenance for a further two years .
it is not satisfactory because legal uncertainty results from all these points .
in the rapporteur &apos;s view , it would be wrong to miss this opportunity to ensure that this directive does more than supply a set of definitions .
it opens up opportunities in other Member States for dentists , doctors , construction workers and gas engineers that were often closed as a result of an effective ‘ closed shop ’ among the professions .
Commissioner , Austria was always against the phasing out of the quotas .
it must draw up a legal immigration policy that can manage all immigration , which , like the wind , cannot be stopped but must be controlled .
the Committee for Women &apos;s Rights and Gender Equality presented an excellent report in 2003 , but very little has happened since .
the fact that even as we are debating this initiative , we have heard unofficial news that the Council has requested its withdrawal , gives a clear indication of its attitude .
first there is the seventh framework programme .
in writing . - I am delighted that the European Parliament has today approved a scheme for ensuring that additional loans will be made available to small businesses .
 
furthermore this is not only a question of looking at the cost of a delegation , but of looking at the very real damage done to the effectiveness of public spending as a result of not monitoring such spending .
in its present form , this system is only capable of serving a maximum of 18 participating countries .
this was confirmed in the most decisive manner by the Luxembourg Presidency , by Mr Juncker personally and by the foreign ministers , Mr Asselborn and Mr Schmit .
I am a committed proponent of net neutrality .
as Mr Patten said , and I would like to thank him for the positions which he defended , the crucial point is China .
undertakings to provide humanitarian aid were also made and in November a further meeting of the G24 will take place to review the progress made in reforms in this country and to collect funds for the balance of payments in 1998 .
it is also illusory to believe that solidarity is fostered by introducing new taxes , in other words by imposing what is tantamount to a financial penalty on those who are actually supposed to help .
in this context , I would like to make another comment . The implementation of the treaty must reflect the three principles of the draft constitution and the Constitutional Convention : efficiency , transparency and democracy .
this is in sharp contrast with American policy .
the legislation adopted in 1998 by Community institutions made it possible to safeguard innovations in the biotechnology sector by issuing patent certificates , thereby putting an end to the uncertainty plaguing this particular sector .
this would require the Commission to make a decision that compensation can be given for new processing methods without actually taking away the structure of the manufacturing capacity that is available for these alternative fuels in many Member States .
I firmly support the idea for Member States to keep their national tax policies .
moreover , it is a geopolitical area where freedom , democracy and respect for human rights have been making remarkable progress .
it makes a big difference whether we in the European Union are going it pretty much alone or whether we at least have our partners in the USA – who are of course our competitors as well – on board .
I believe that we should in fact , as part of the TEN programme - the Trans-European Networks - start on the building of visible bridges .
in spite of the tiny budget allocated to it , an efficient fisheries sector forms a not insignificant part of any dynamic trade and budget policy for the EU and should be seen as a sector of the economy in its own right and as a significant branch of the food industry .
it is therefore essentially to avoid the undesirable inflation of a blank cheque that I am proposing that the national parliaments should become parties to the European Union &apos;s jurisdictional system , alongside national governments and the Union &apos;s institutions .
global climate warming caused by human activity is a fact .
the continuing negative publicity about members &apos; travel expenses damages Parliament &apos;s reputation .
the EU does not need more institutional power struggles .
political parties help to form the will of the people – in the European context , we should say ‘ of the peoples ’ – and that is why it is essential that the European institutions should establish the prerequisites and create the conditions for the proper functioning of these European parties .
finally , on 25 August , as you know , the governments of the Union ’ s Member States decided to respond to our appeals for action and also to the appeals to them from the United Nations to send a significant contingent of troops from European countries to operate on the ground .
concerning those who have lost their lives : you cannot bring back a life .
today we basically have two ways of paying electronically : using &apos; smart &apos; cards , onto which we can &apos; load &apos; money ; or by &apos; loading &apos; money onto our computers via various programs and systems which enable us to pay over the Internet .
the report has become a paradoxical document which gives neither this Parliament nor the Commission , and certainly not the Council , anything to go on .
in this context , the recent bilateral agreement between Turkey and Iraq on the fight against terrorism is a welcome step .
this was clearly a step designed to keep opposition to a minimum before next year &apos;s election .
the predatory exploitation of natural resources has to be stopped , together with the speculative activities of international businesses that are enriching themselves at the expense of the life and health of the region &apos;s inhabitants .
the agreements should be adopted through a fruitful interinstitutional agreement that enables the European institutions to participate actively in them .
bees are a very important Minor Use / Minor Species ( MUMS ) issue .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission would like to thank Parliament and especially the excellent rapporteur , Mrs Kirsten Jensen , and the Council for the progress which has been made during the conciliation procedure with this draft directive which adds a substantial new element to EU legislation on chemicals .
this is an area of our activities that we must improve if we are to become more credible in the eyes of the citizens .
our concern should be to focus on what is still wrong today .
the concern for the safety of farm animals in transportation procedures is supported , but with reservations as to the success of the Commission &apos;s proposals .
is this newly emerging political spectrum also being monitored by ourselves in the context of the programme for democracy ?
solidarity has been pledged by many Member States , the Commission and other countries , and Greece is grateful to those who have taken swift action against a natural disaster arising from conditions beyond anything we could have imagined .
( FR ) Mr President , Mr Vice-President of the Commission , to my mind , something major is absent from the document before us and it was absent , too , from Mr Barroso &apos;s speech .
when I am an ancient 87-year-old , there will be just 66 million children of that age in Europe .
in regard to the disposal of animal waste we have found that one attempt to avoid risk has faced us with another risk .
but I would also like to point out that , while it has allowed us to get out of trouble , it has not resolved our problem .
in that regard , the Malaysian Home Ministry has a particular responsibility to explain thoroughly and objectively to its citizens the issue at stake .
I agree with his criticism .
it has not been an easy job to construct an EU-China report , because there are a multitude of factors that have needed to be considered .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this proposal was presented on 20 December 2001 in order to respond to the request of the European Council in Laeken .
I would therefore advise the House to accept the Council &apos;s request in relation to the urgency procedure , and not accept the change of legal basis in relation to this issue .
it is meant to create a fair balance between the levels .
but in the Aznar Government &apos;s law on football , it is possible to withdraw those rights retroactively and without compensation .
we need a clear obligation for Member States to improve these indicators .
over the last 50 years , the population of this species has fallen by as much as 75 % .
but , because there are lots of Poles in the UK , most of whom are very welcome , we get lots of arrest warrants from Poland .
as regards the internal ratings-based approach and smaller banks , the framework likely to be proposed will be based on an evolutionary and flexible approach .
perhaps there is a declaration - may I ask through the Chair - that the Commissioner is going to put on the record : I recall a discussion in relation to this issue some months ago concerning a review of the Veterinary Medicines Directive .
author . - ( PL ) Mr President , we have been waiting for quite a long time for the oral question on Varosha , in the Famagusta area , to appear on the European Parliament &apos;s agenda .
I am in favour of green growth , of viable growth , but I am not in favour of the deindustrialisation of Europe .
evidently , one has to lose a war and governing power , and bankrupt one &apos; s own economy , to be condemned a war criminal .
they do not come from these areas .
we therefore invite the Member States to extend the mandate of the European Maritime Safety Agency ( EMSA ) on safety inspections and to regulate offshore oil extraction in Europe , following the recent natural disaster in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico .
Mr President , there is a need for a radical change of course in the EU &apos;s energy policy . Its sights should be set on the fastest possible transition to sustainability , with renewable energy sources explicitly stipulated as the main aim of the energy policy and energy prices clearly reflecting the real environmental costs .
Mr President , finally , the moment had arrived .
Madam President , I would simply like to follow up what Mrs Morgantini said about the lists in Turkey .
I wish to express my alarm about the hostile messages being spread about Eastern Europeans , and Romanians in particular , in the foreign media , which has taken the form up until now of extremist rhetoric .
the EGF is also part of the European social model .
President of the Commission . - I would like to thank Graham Watson for this very important question .
for example , the installation of microchips which suggest that cartridges are empty and even in some cases stop printers working , when in fact they have plenty of ink left .
I always try to understand the situation of different groups of farmers in the individual countries , and I am in favour of solutions that help them , since I know that as a group , they are in an exceptionally difficult situation in terms of revenue .
the rapporteur is also trying to secure support for people with special needs , who are important and equal members of our society .
despite all this , European Union integration has been a resounding success .
of course , the best solution would be for us not to eat them at all and for us not to wear animals in the form of furs .
one of the reasons for the failure of the Cancún debate was its use and misuse , for example by NGOs .
that is not going to be delivered by 96 separate proposals , but by your Commission working together to tackle that .
let us therefore take this step forward and not invest unnecessarily in mobility that patients do not want anyway .
with regard to the report , on which I worked with the shadow rapporteurs from other political groups , whom I thank for their work , our intention was for users to have all the security and privacy that they want when using these new technologies .
no national reconciliation is possible without proper court procedures , and that involves both the Rwandan national justice system and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda .
this report aims to be in harmony and in line with the current moment : with the economic , financial and social situation through which we are struggling , with the crisis that we are experiencing , and , at the same time , with what the European public wants from the European Union and its institutions .
but so far as I am aware , no such proceedings have been instituted .
it remains to be seen whether this is in the best interests of the Timorese in the long run .
this is even more true for Parliament , where the already extremely restricted scope for freedom - simply look , for example , at the way in which the President is elected , or the way in which speaking time is reduced for non-attached Members and their right to influence the legislative process is violated - would be further reduced by a code defining communication procedures .
we ask Parliament not to approve it .
with almost 14 million jobs involved , and with sustained growth even during the crisis , it remains essential to show unfailing support for these industries , so great is their economic and cultural contribution .
EU partnership in the Horn of Africa ( debate )
after all , by not being represented on such a forum , the European Parliament &apos;s independent position is guaranteed .
to this extent , I hope that the announcements by the Council and by the Commission were not just empty promises .
the Committee on Budgets took note of the declarations , showing a great sense of responsibility - partly because it wanted to strengthen appropriate cooperation with the Commission and the Council - and decided to take account of this situation . Accordingly , in an extraordinary meeting held yesterday , it decided not to endorse the budget amendments tabled in the first reading .
parallel to this we have also embarked on the process of improving coherence and clarifying and bringing to the surface and into the open the real or imaginary problems we are having in this respect .
Mr President , Madam President-in-Office of the Council , you have already been praised several times during the course of this debate , and rightly so , for your understanding and your sincere appeal for a proper new start in a common Europe .
how can so-called &apos; sexual and reproductive rights &apos; be weighed against development aid or deadlines for joining the European Union ?
what has actually happened with the elections ?
can we really concentrate on the defence of burgeoning human life , when beings already alive are too often ignored , neglected and oppressed ?
ladies and gentlemen , a look at the situation of European Union maritime transport can lead to ambivalent conclusions .
I voted today in favour of Parliament &apos;s resolution , which was also supported by most of the political groups and which contains Parliament &apos;s conditions for the ratification of the new SWIFT agreement and the start of a new round of negotiations with the US .
we have our doubts about the value of such an appointment , because such an envoy would probably be prevented from having a real impact on the ground or from playing a significant role in this dialogue .
measurements of mixed oxide fuels , MOX , can be confirmed with greater accuracy and less effort at the fuel production plants , i.e. at the plants that produce fuels for reactors , than at the reactors producing nuclear energy , in which the fuel is ultimately used .
we deal with problems such as poverty , the environment , equality , ethnic crises and fundamentalism .
we will certainly be very willing to give our support to Iran in this context .
Mr President , I think that is acceptable .
it is true that the Palestinian suicide attacks are despicable - we all know that - but what did Mr Sharon do during the periods in which there were no attacks ?
one was for climate change , the other was for biodiversity , and there was also the separate issue of deforestation , an important one .
the actual figure is much higher if we take account of farms outside the network , which are obviously small holdings , meaning that far more than 23.2 % of all Community holdings receive a mere 1.4 % of total direct aid .
thirdly , all partners must show flexibility in the negotiations .
moreover , the Commission has proposed that the accumulation of grants for construction should be prevented premiums for withdrawal .
will these reports be available on the internet ?
if we really want to see the dreams of Europe come true , that is freedom , democracy and international relations , we should be calling for the resignation of Wolfowitz and Bush .
it is up to individual countries or regions to introduce tougher rules regarding , for example , the time of transports .
there are areas such as the environment and the fight against fraud which should however be subordinated to the subsidiarity principle .
take China , for example . Imported seeds arrive in Austria and then the so-called &apos; pressed seed oil &apos; is sold there .
the aim is , by harmonising national laws , to reconcile common objectives which are both cultural and economic and which concern the development of telecommunications and information technologies and the strengthening of the European programme industry .
that is the best European good governance we can have .
hence it is very important that we should have organised and motivated a cultural revolution in Europe , for the Member States &apos; dealings with the national central banks used not to have the democratic accountability we have now .
we also asked you specific questions about the impact assessment .
hitherto Moldova has fully exhausted the quota it was allocated , therefore an increase in duty free tariff quotas will enable Moldova to increase sales of its production in the EU , without damaging the EU &apos;s wine industry .
question No 9 by ( H-0552 / 00 ) :
through these requirements and these desires expressed by the European Parliament , it is indeed a question of developing the Union into a real political community .
in short , a success story .
finally , the Commission cannot accept the proposal to decrease the minimum number of partners from four to three for shorter duration projects and to decrease the number of countries from six to four for longer duration projects .
why should we reduce the capacity of our units to the level of our quota ?
Mr President , I am delighted to hear what the Commissioner has said about working closely with the United Nations .
Jörg Haider &apos; s rise to power , with the inauguration of a conservative right-wing and FPÖ coalition government , is a sign of the terrible revival in Europe of a monster to which liberalism has given birth .
further financial assistance is needed in the future as well to help new Member States close the gap and ensure that they can access rural development aid with better co-financing conditions post-2013 , as well .
if this trend were to become established , ladies and gentlemen , we would once again be seeing an anomaly in the matter of the seat and of the institutions and organs of the European Union , and in that case my group would be firmly opposed to it .
the Uzbek authorities have rejected international demands for an independent enquiry and no credible investigation of the killings has taken place .
the importance of protecting and managing the resource base of economic and social development was reaffirmed by Heads of State and Government at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in September 2002 .
indeed up to the present time an objective for these zones has not existed .
these two European citizens are acting on our behalf , too ; they are acting to make up for our political failure .
Mr President , I would like to take advantage of the presence of the Commissioner , Mrs Reding , to ask her a specific question .
this measure voted today is an internal market Directive , part of a package designed to open up the EU market to competition and enable telecoms companies and ISPs to operate on a level playing field .
make up your mind .
on behalf of my group I have tabled just three additional amendments for tomorrow &apos;s vote .
why are we two reports behind schedule ?
in the case of proposed amendments relating to obligatory spending , a majority of the votes cast is sufficient .
) Mr President , I agree with the Honourable Member that it would be appropriate to discuss core labour standards at the WTO round , and preparations are based on the recognition that these matters have to be discussed .
although the cosmetics industry itself has carried out a certain amount of research that is worth mentioning , the Commission has to a large extent limited its own action to merely coordinating certain validation programmes .
and if I am not mistaken , what are the arguments for not making that important proposal , where the Commission itself has authority ?
Mr President , I asked earlier to take the floor for a point of order . This is what I wanted to say :
therefore , during the whole process we will insist on the importance of preserving the institutional balance in this regulation and preserving the exclusive right of initiative for the Commission , because the Commission is responsible to all citizens - not only to the organisers of the initiative , but also to general European interests .
this practice has increased the bureaucracy involved in distributing the resources and resulted in the central government &apos;s own objectives being given priority over regional objectives .
one very positive step here has been the creation of the Regional Centre for Combating Transborder Crime in Bucharest , and this centre will be represented at the relevant conference in London on 25 November .
in this respect , I look forward to the work of the conference to be held in Stockholm because this is the conference which may shape the future approach of Member States and the Commission to the macro-regional approach in the future and it should also embrace the financing of potential future strategies .
thank you Mr President .
in any case , this gives a clear signal that the Community does care and does recognise the importance of strong promotion of our European products .
nevertheless , there were , inevitably , differences of opinion on one point or another , particularly as regards the test period or what alternative courses of action might be available if the decision turned out to be negative , that is to say if the application for the acquisition of a shareholding or for the takeover of a whole business were to be turned down .
I would stress the importance of the adoption by the plenary sitting of the European Parliament of this report proposing the introduction of minimum income schemes in all EU Member States , for which I was responsible .
as many speakers stated in yesterday &apos;s debate , the actions of the US Administration have also been harshly criticised , because of its responsibility for the way in which the situation in the region has developed .
on the subject of the transitional stage that you propose in the documents , I would like to ask you what you propose doing if there is no conclusion by December .
I think that the fact that the report will be accepted tomorrow and will in fact be implemented is much more important .
it is there that the new challenge lies following the failure of Lisbon .
ladies and gentlemen , the European Parliament cannot endorse the fisheries agreements with Guinea while the victims &apos; wounds are still fresh .
given the country &apos;s political and economical weight , the report rightly recommends that the EU spares no effort to progress quickly with the consolidation of the strategic association between the EU and India .
I would like to add that the flight from Amsterdam &apos; s Schipol airport was also delayed and then cancelled .
this is an energy source from the past , from the 1960s !
the authorities in the Member States do not know how to deal with this regulation which has just entered into force .
after all , the new Member States are not obliged to meet the criteria for membership today ; they must do so at the time of accession . In other words , what we have to do today is to assess whether the remaining tasks can be completed within the timeframe .
we are going , therefore , to consider the four fifths , Declaration 30 and an Intergovernmental Conference ; and we shall perhaps make this or that change to the draft Constitution , otherwise it will never be acceptable in the two countries that said ‘ no ’ .
it risks creating migratory flows towards the EU , in particular , the southern Member States .
by supporting this kind of development , then , we shall at the same time be helping to combat illegal immigration .
however , we are waiting on the banks .
I have made it clear since I took over the chair that I expect people to keep to their speaking time for the rest of this evening or else we are going to have trouble because we will run over midnight and I do not wish to do that .
Madam President , Commissioner , I wish firstly to thank Mr Titley for the interesting and excellent work he has done and for the interesting discussions we have had in the Committee .
I have re-read the Euratom Treaty very carefully and have also looked closely at the Nuclear Safety Directive adopted by the Council and Parliament in June two years ago .
adult stem cells are a promising development , worthy of mention .
I therefore ask for correction of that unjust comment against farmers who have been literally struggling for their livelihoods for the last ten days .
the United States must either bring the captives before a court or release them , in accordance with international law .
in reply to Mr Sjöstedt &apos;s question , let me emphasise that the internal organisation of the Commission is the affair of that institution alone .
the uniqueness of this organisation lies in the fact that it links the political and military , economic and environmental , and human rights dimensions of cooperation .
lastly , it would have been useful if the report had made a recommendation for the evaluation of excessive deficits to include a toned-down golden rule .
we expect the Council to respect the budgetary powers of Parliament and extend democracy in our Union through qualified majority voting and greater codecision .
I believe that we must emphasise this issue .
the future does not lie in a world in which one world superpower and a couple of large Member States in Europe call the shots .
my group too feels that is it particularly important for the balancing premium between potato starch and cereal starch to be maintained .
this is precisely why the works of art and literature that have been created in all these languages , and the special manner in which these are expressed , are what we need to be able to access .
at almost every meeting at higher diplomatic levels , all we are able to do is to give a shy reminder of the issue of violations of human rights in this country .
thank you , Commissioner !
many fellow Members have already voiced their criticism on a number of serious issues .
it makes sense that this resolution is trying to unify the fragmented regulations of the individual countries in a uniform framework , and to set up a unified operating methodology for communication frequency assignment .
we are unable , however , to vote in favour of this agreement for the reasons stated and must continue to fight for better agreements in the future .
never before has European foreign and cooperation policy been as negative as in recent years , since the CFSP was codified , and never before has it led to such political inertia .
decentralisation is needed to make decision-making more effective and also to ensure that when there is no pressing reason for something to be dealt with in Brussels , it can be decided on locally .
however , it is an open secret that some Member States unfortunately still have the wrong attitude to fisheries policy .
products of plant origin , for example , cereals , leguminous crops , vegetables , fruit and wood , are also included in this .
since the use of fossil fuels , we have seen an increase not only in the tempo and volume of production , but in pollution too .
furthermore , it does not reflect the current situation in many Member States .
Italy is being penalised , and that is a cause for concern , but what matters most of all is that the reasons for this penalisation are ill-founded .
( DA ) Mr President , first of all , I would like to thank the rapporteur for a splendid piece of work and a well-balanced report .
written statements ( Rule 149 )
of course , Mr Berthu .
 
as the report rightly points out , the existing rules must be adapted to structural changes and technological developments , while fully observing the basic principles of the current ‘ Television without Frontiers ’ Directive .
after the conciliation procedure had finished , Parliament &apos;s delegation was therefore amazed to find , in the conclusions of the Florence summit , that two Member States wished to modify project No 8 on the list .
together , let us show that our Union meets the needs of its people : enhancing security without threatening liberty ; building the foundation for jobs without undermining solidarity ; gaining EU added value without diminishing identity .
as I said , I voted for it and I hope that more and more will be done to keep all citizens , particularly pensioners , informed .
in conclusion , I should like to refer to the problem of comitology .
in our view , the matter does not present major difficulties and will even provide greater coherence .
( DE ) Madam President , yes , I also voted against the report on a smoke-free Europe , although by doing so , I am subjecting myself to what is tantamount to a witch-hunt , even in the House by the way .
lastly , this directive introduces heavier penalties for traffickers ( five years minimum ) and strengthens protection and assistance for victims .
I am pleased that this step has drawn broad support from various areas : social partners , industry and sector organisations , educational institutions and NGOs .
I wish to thank Commissioner Nielson for his reply .
reference was made to Amendment 67 on relaxation of the rule for affiliations to social security systems .
I therefore regret that we do not have a majority in favour of re-launching this debate which is essential for the future of research .
this is what was agreed .
however , we cannot afford to behave in an erratic , inconsequential and fragmented manner .
on the contrary , we found it to be a valuable instrument , and still do .
the question of nuclear safety generally concerns the Council , which fully supports achieving a high standard of nuclear safety throughout the European Union .
in this case though , I was designated to speak on this very important issue for the Group and I seek to make that statement now .
it seems that the concept of the four freedoms underpinning the European Union is something that , sadly , often exists only on paper .
which steps do the Commission and Council intend to take in order to achieve this ?
you are someone from my own linguistic region , and I hope you will give me a prompt answer .
thanks to the initiative of parents &apos; associations and professional groups , a national day , the first of its kind , is now to be held in Paris on 10 October and it is hoped that this will make the press more aware of the situation of the people , and especially children , who are affected by problems of this kind .
what we need to do is to get close to them , and we need to get close to them not just by expressing an interest which , it goes without saying , is manifest on all sides ; we need to get close to them in practice , both physically and geographically , but mainly by learning about their history and what makes them tick .
I think that we have succeeded in this .
it is clear that when that is put in place , those living and roaming in internal border regions will be among the biggest beneficiaries of the regulation .
we must find ways of providing humanitarian assistance .
what end do political statements serve if they are not followed through with financial acts ?
the first concerns the fight against corruption .
the treatment of Africa as a partner in strategic dialogue was also reflected in the method followed when both preparing for the summit and producing the documents that this summit was to adopt .
I am , therefore , confident that we have the potential and will find the political will to respond to the new challenges in the perspective of the 2000-2004 European Union drugs strategy .
we cannot accept your Amendment No 5 because we feel that we should not keep on promoting the overcapitalisation of the EU fleet .
I am very happy to pass that assurance on , because it certainly has been the case that at no point in the discussion of this matter has she in any way deviated from the view which I am putting to the House .
Member States cannot do this sufficiently by themselves .
in my 20 years in this Parliament I have seen whisky being treated unfairly time after time , the first time being the absurd proposal by a previous Commission that whisky labels should contain instructions as to use followed by last date for human consumption .
in its communication on climate change , the Commission has defined a number of key principles regarding the flexibility mechanisms .
even if the Environment Committee &apos;s policy document appears to improve on and clarify some points , there are nonetheless many uncertainties and problems remaining in relation to the consumer , the seller and the Danish legal tradition in the area of the Sale of Goods Act .
the rate of selectivity per species is therefore obviously not the same for the North as for the South .
it calls for sensible , practical and concrete steps to be taken to create better consumer protection throughout the European Union .
it sums up the speeches on the benefits of free competition that is lacking in rules .
nobody needs a police or judiciary based on ethnicity , but it is certainly true that a better and more qualified presence of personnel coming from the minority communities could improve their functioning , by facilitating communication with citizens in their mother tongue .
with the prospect of establishing a Palestinian state on the horizon , we must also help to convince the Palestinian Authority to abandon its twin-track approach and to start behaving in a fully responsible way .
there is therefore a need to reaffirm the axiom that we are in a market economy , not a market society .
and I am happy that the rapporteur has made the proposal for a research voucher , trying to secure that we have a spontaneous process for excellence between researchers in Europe by creating and increasing their mobility .
many of us were proud and stood tall when we were recently granted a joint EU seat on the Security Council .
what is key here is that the plan must provide stranded passengers with not just safety , of course , but information and help , as well , so that those who are affected , at the very least , have someone they can turn to and are guaranteed shelter .
that , eventually , was the good news .
we do not need them in one week or two weeks ; we need them today , tomorrow and certainly on Friday when the European Council will make its first political statement on this issue .
the rapporteur sees a clear role for the European Commission in this field , but unfortunately this role must be limited as the European Union is not a member as such of the International Labour Organisation .
we are able to accept Amendments Nos 39 and 40 .
we must attach greater importance to the formulation of firm proposals designed to ensure that global competition , which is certainly what we want , takes place on a level playing field with the same rules for everyone .
in the case of a Member of Parliament this applies even more forcefully , and for this reason you should overwhelmingly reject this request for a waiver because immunity is there not to protect the person of the Member of Parliament but to protect freedom , his freedom to think , his freedom to have his own views .
we shall support the new Member States and I hope , personally speaking , that the Agenda , in 2007 , will enable them to benefit , like all the other Member States , from every aspect of the cohesion policy .
that advice is the advice of ICES .
what else can we call Renault &apos;s decision to close its plant at Vilvoorde ?
small businesses for certain .
it states correctly that a lot of money is going to Western companies .
at the same time , they also choose in favour of continued development towards more harmonisation and centralisation , a trend which has been in motion for years .
I am pleased that , in addition to metallic mercury , the ban includes mercury-containing products that cannot be sold or distributed in the European Union , cinnabar ore and mercury compounds .
Mr President , I would like to thank all the rapporteurs for their constructive cooperation .
by resisting the WTO ruling , it will be possible to open the way to revising the mechanisms of that organization and its procedures for settling disputes so as to take more account of social , health , cultural and environmental concerns .
but even in this case the judge must be able to test the implications of expelling the asylum-seeker if he is indeed to be expelled .
. – The European Parliament resolution on the western Balkans expresses the more general move of the USA and the EU towards new border changes , the competition between them to divide up the area and the EU &apos;s attempts to annex it to Euro-transatlantic structures .
Commissioner Nielson &apos;s department have produced an excellent communication and programme for action for communicable infectious diseases , HIV Aids , TB and malaria .
it was established in 2002 when the floods happened .
rapporteur . - ( PT ) Mr President , Commissioner , this regulation , Regulation ( EC ) No 861 / 2006 , establishes Community financial measures for the implementation of the common fisheries policy ( CFP ) and in the area of the law of the sea .
we should ask ourselves what really belongs in state services of general interest .
the European Commission has investigated how much money the European Union can effectively set aside in Iraq .
this report must serve first and foremost as the basis for future projects , for the next programme .
the experience , the bitter experience we all have from the way we handled matters there should lead us to act differently from the way we acted in Bosnia .
however , I am inclined to favour an interinstitutional agreement as the best way forward , probably because it offers flexibility for us to alter and change in the future .
I wonder , Commissioner , if you are aware of the fact that opposition parties had no chance at all to put their case via the media in Algeria prior to this referendum ?
the concentration on road transport will no doubt exacerbate the existing problems in densely populated areas and on the main transport routes .
( PL ) Madam President , the title of Mr Kirilov &apos;s report , on which I congratulate him , suggests that we may also speak of an unreal economy .
you could have taken up proposals from this Parliament to establish meaningful , devolved , regional management of fisheries , but instead you promoted toothless advisory councils .
having said this , let me also assure you that the Commission will continue to take account of the specific interests of the outermost regions in current , but also in future , negotiations of this nature .
we need to implement a policy , to my mind an aggressive policy , to help those countries from where these immigrants originate . An attempt has been made to do this , I believe , with the recent association agreements with North-African countries .
this is why I call on the Turkish Government to step up the reform process in order to fulfil the accession criteria completely .
four priority areas were identified where progress is essential namely
however , on first reading , the Parliament highlighted the weak wording which would in effect , in my view and that of the Parliament , allow certain ferries to either carry a sub- standard black box or not carry a black box at all .
as evidence of this , I would cite the climate change package that was signed under the French Presidency .
the Ministry of the Interior has already been undertaking initiatives to prevent and control inter-ethnic incidents in Vojvodina since 2004 , but the participation of minorities in social life and their proper institutional representation must be promoted .
strategic alliances are now of fundamental importance in strengthening the international competitiveness of the European air travel sector .
I was interested to discover that the United Kingdom appears to be the second largest producer of ethyl alcohol and , along with other producers , is of course concerned at increasing imports but rather static Community demand .
European citizens are making ever more demands in relation to food security , which must be guaranteed along the whole production , processing and distribution chain .
I should particularly like to emphasise the setting of new priorities in social integration .
even before the recent immoral attacks , we saw years of collective punishment of the Palestinian people .
we regard the design and issuing of driving licences as a matter for national governments , not only in the EU but throughout the world .
today &apos;s Europe is divided into peoples .
we were aware that this regulation was not intended to be a new legal instrument , but a tool to be used in conjunction with other structures already in existence .
the shift can be seen in the fact that the delegates at the summit ultimately recognised that , in the interests of energy security and cutting emissions , the Member States can make use of nuclear energy .
in June 2008 , the European Parliament managed to approve a resolution prohibiting this type of marketing after several attempts .
( Applause ) Third-party monitoring of the proper implementation of those agreements and a functioning dispute settlement mechanism would obviously help to address Palestinian frustration with the current non-implementation of existing agreements .
the Reform Treaty changes the pivotal European Union documents in a fundamental way .
it is high time to end the reflection period and inaugurate a period of action .
the second aspect of the revolution for the future is new controls , new regulations , and new cultures .
at this important time , the European Union has four clear messages for the Ukrainian people .
car journeys are reimbursed on the basis of the first class rail fare .
the size of the sector , with almost five million hectares of olive trees , producing some 1 , 400 , 000 tonnes of olive oil , its location in the southern part of the European Union , and more specifically in areas where no alternatives exist , its contribution in generating the only available jobs in many areas , the dominant position of the European Union on the world market , and a market situation offering good prospects of continued growth in oil consumption seem reason enough to have suggested to the Commissioner the advisability of adopting a procedure similar to that used for wine , the fruit and vegetable sector or certain continental products . This would have meant opening a debate in which appropriate options would have been proposed on the basis of the Commission &apos;s views , identification of the problems , the environmental , social and rural development implications in the olive sector , the growth of and trends in olive producers &apos; incomes , the production and trade situation and competition with other types of vegetable oils .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
meanwhile , instead of asking ourselves how we can bring down food prices in the EU , we are subsidising expensive agriculture in the old countries , while in the new accession countries we are supporting the cheaper production of healthy foods only to a limited extent , and this is obviously going to restrict any growth in production in these countries .
- The content of the next Framework Programme needs to be changed in various ways as compared with the present programme , but not quite as proposed in the report .
( addressing Mr Schulz and Mr Cohn-Bendit who had heckled him )
customer satisfaction , it seems , is no longer always the best commercial policy , and there are almost too many examples from everyday life suggesting rather the opposite .
it also invited them to allow the humanitarian agencies and other international organisations immediate and unfettered access to the region concerned .
we believe there will be a shortage of eggs and sperm .
a good deal of progress has been made in this area , and the Commission will of course present its white paper as soon as possible .
one has already been mentioned in the presidency document which has been given to Members : it is the fight against international crime and illicit drug-trafficking .
in this instance , the Council is therefore consulting Parliament for the appointment of Mr Draghi for President of the ECB from 1 November 2011 .
if we do not give them a good answer and cannot indicate how this cooperation is to be organised , then citizens &apos; enthusiasm for Baltic Sea cooperation will probably quickly turn to frustration .
in writing - ( PL ) I would like to express my support for the idea of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership and the establishment of a Euro-Mediterranean Free Trade Area by 2010 as announced in the Barcelona Declaration .
I strongly recommend , as we tend here in Parliament to set targets and to say &apos; 20 % &apos; or &apos; 30 % &apos; , that we recommend a standard European legislation which sets a minimum prison sentence for human traffickers of 10-15 years , which cannot be reduced or replaced by a fine .
&apos; Conservation of tuna &apos; !
I must stress to you that our group will not be at all satisfied with a Treaty that does not take a qualitative leap forward , more specifically regarding common foreign and security policy , majority decisions in judicial cooperation , majority decisions in the first pillar , and European Parliament participation in decisions .
the world that surrounds the Union is changing and if we are not careful we will lag further and further behind .
just because Fair Trade schemes are not a panacea , that does not mean to say that we should fail to support them .
the next item is the joint debate on the Council and Commission statements on :
sixthly , we support all measures aimed at achieving the Millennium Objectives and , in this regard , we welcome the G8 ’ s decision to cancel the debt of the 18 poorest countries on this planet .
however , as the Commissioner for the budget , I am bound to say that a solution must be found which does not affect the budget .
B5-0195 / 2001 by Mrs Dybkjær , Mrs Thors and Mr Maaten , on behalf of the ELDR Group , on access to drugs for HIV / AIDS victims in the Third World ;
I also wish to emphasise the importance of the &apos; ICT and tourism &apos; platform proposed by the Commission .
the truth is that I feel frustrated that our hopes and efforts have not been accompanied by efficiency on the part of the people responsible for the implementation of this programme .
thirdly , despite possible discrepancies between parliamentary groups on certain points of the proposal we debated , we must not forget that , in reality , we are providing all the European national systems with a structure that may operate efficiently in accordance with the Geneva Convention on the status of refugees .
all that is needed is for it to be clear and reliable for all participants in the market .
to conclude , Mr President , allow me to point out the happy coincidence that today the majority of this House and the groups that have a European dimension , and we should not forget that we have a European dimension , have members from all the countries in the Union .
I would like to ask you what stage this project is at , bearing in mind the importance of establishing this infrastructure .
however , there are alternatives !
this will be difficult enough , since the enthusiasm for Agenda 21 that was generated in Rio in 1992 is now ebbing away .
it must be recognised that state and institution building is taking place .
for this reason , the Commission must see to it that these tasks are actually carried out .
numerous events are indicative of the Turkish authorities &apos; attempts to call into question the ecumenical nature of the Patriarchate of Constantinople .
the common position is , in fact , quite a significant step forward but it does not deal with all the problems .
Mr President , I very much support what the presidency said , including the last comments .
the Commission is working in a coordinated manner with the Council .
&apos; one state , one vote &apos; is , after all , one of the foundation stones of the United Nations .
bearing in mind the expected increase in the energy CO2 emissions and the low budget allocated to SAVE II it is rather unlikely that the internationally agreed objectives for reducing emissions could be achieved by this programme .
but on the same day the Arab side decided it would be wrong to contaminate the La Valetta meeting and that the Mediterranean project had its own content and its own momentum to keep it going .
in addition , in the course of practical application sometimes there are high costs and &apos; unexpected problems &apos; .
this is something that has to be considered in connection with the practical application of the proposal , once it has properly entered into force .
Mila esker
it is undeniable that between President Assad , who is sticking to a rigid political stance and whose duty it is , therefore , to react strongly to the serious provocation represented by an attack on Syrian soil , and Prime Minister Sharon who , 13 months away from the US elections , can feel that he has a particularly free rein , there are elements that could further inflame tensions and result in the entire region becoming engulfed .
the report on the Green Paper insists on reforms that I believe to be necessary for better implementation of this policy on a regional level , particularly decentralisation of fisheries management to take account of the specific features of each region and to link in the sustainability of the sector through the preservation of species .
a warm welcome to you !
harmonization of the rules for the transfusion process , particularly as regards the selection of donors and screening tests , is absolutely indispensable and urgent throughout Europe .
thank you for the information on Spain .
producing these evaluations is a job for politicians , and in order to be able to carry out these evaluations , we need to be given the resources through , for instance , this centre .
heavy goods transport throughout Europe is one of these factors and another is nuclear power stations .
it also encourages Member States &apos; parliaments to address the whole problem of gold plating .
you have heard the calls of men , the appeals of children and women who lost most of their family members .
this parenthetical remark by the Commission must surely pull us up short .
when , a year and a half ago , I took on the portfolio of commissioner responsible for justice , freedom and security , I found on my desk two large-scale information technology projects aimed at equipping the Member States with modern and effective cooperation tools .
these will be assessed by the Commission , and for the Commission , this is an acceptable construction .
it constitutes a violation of women &apos;s fundamental rights , particularly the right to personal integrity and sexual and reproductive rights .
however , the most important step forward is the current directive proposals by the Commission , firstly for procurement in the area of security and defence , and secondly in the area of the internal shipment of defence goods .
yes , the world is changing . Europe has to adapt .
my other question concerns Africa , which is the only continent not mentioned in &apos; Shaping the New Europe &apos; .
Madam President , I do not agree with some of the amendments proposed by the rapporteur and accepted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens &apos; Rights .
we believe , in fact , that it is essential that the Commission should , within three years , submit a methodology designed in conjunction with the Member States , in order to establish this minimum safety distance .
in view of a possible compromise with Parliament , which has stressed the need to protect consumers from price increases on standard postal services , and with regard to Amendments Nos 6 , 9 and 10 , the Commission could agree to widening the proposed scope of postal services that may qualify for a reduced rate so as to include standard postal services relating to items of up to 10 kg in weight .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first I would like to thank everyone for their active involvement in preparing this report .
this momentum , which the European Union harnessed to implement the conclusions of the last Earth Summit as fully as possible , must be maintained with a view to the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol , as defined at Bonn and Marrakech .
as in the case of the structural funds , the citizens will be led to believe that Europe is handing out heaven-sent money in order to assist them in managing refugees .
the share that renewable energy sources have in total energy production must be increased , but it has to be done in a rational manner .
there is now a chance for a new beginning .
Mr Fava mentioned that the Commission recognises that aid measures in favour of small-scale fisheries have not succeeded , and how no immediate action to protect them is planned , in spite of the fact that these small-scale fisheries employ 44 % of all fishermen in the European Union .
the most difficult and sensitive issues are still unsolved .
according to these observers , the appointment by the president of the members of the Constitutional Court , the judges of the Supreme Court and the arbitrators of the Arbitration Court violates democratic principles .
the Commission supports the European Parliament &apos;s initiative to debate the current democratic deficiencies in the Slovak Republic , in particular condemning the expulsion of Mr Gaulieder from the Slovak Parliament and calling for his immediate reinstatement .
in my country , Ireland , we have a referendum when people will have an opportunity to vote , but I congratulate the Hungarian Parliament for their decision today on the ratification process .
the latter will certainly benefit the European public and will enable us to improve our relations with third countries .
we naturally strongly support this step .
at the same time , the five-year period of the Barroso Commission is coming to a close .
Vice-President of the Commission . - ( DE ) Madam President , President-in-Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , the great aim of this initiative , which we presented almost exactly a year ago , was to optimise the free movement of goods within the European internal market while increasing consumer and business confidence in the rules governing the internal market .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , let me first congratulate Mr Adamou on the excellent report he has prepared on organ donation and transplantation .
the auction percentage should be 100 % - as we ourselves as well as the Greens are advocating - since this would be consistent with the &apos; polluter pays &apos; principle .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 .
we need to move over to qualified majority voting to have an efficient working basis under Article 151 of the Treaties .
they are right .
it must be followed by further European and also national measures .
in writing . - ( LT ) I supported this resolution .
however , we very much deplore the fact that the Committee on Fisheries again wishes to subsidise the construction and modernisation of new boats , and indeed their export , although these subsidies were cancelled in 2002 because of their incompatibility with the aims of the policy and because of their pernicious effects .
there is a distinct imbalance there .
this issue is the subject of the report which will be introduced next , so I shall deal with it very quickly .
I welcome the fact that Mr Coelho has mentioned the significance of the emigration pressure from Turkey on Bulgaria and Greece .
in doing so , we also honour the dramatic experience that we commemorate with sadness today .
( EL ) Mr President , obviously , the permanent support mechanism adopted is , without doubt , a positive step .
it is long overdue , but we are at last able to take action to protect children from these high concentrations of toxic substances in their toys .
( PL ) Mr President , media accounts of the Lahti Summit have been dominated by what Prime Minister Vanhanen described as a frank conversation with the President of Russia .
if you have problems at the Commission , Commissioner Diamantopoulou , then just take the excellent report that Parliament produced last autumn .
the European Union ’ s common foreign and security policy has no legitimacy .
it is important that users , the consumers , are well represented on this committee .
it is important to recognise the need to increase public and private investment in ICT tools in order to develop smart energy infrastructures for transport .
this European Parliament resolution , despite containing aspects with which we agree - for example , its references to the need for respect for social laws and collective agreements , training or the needs of the most remote regions - subscribes to a concept of liberalisation of the sector and creation of the so-called &apos; Single European Sky &apos; .
we would , of course , have preferred it if the Commission had put forward a specific proposal for a directive during these five years .
that is why I voted for the report .
I have long believed that we should all recognise that countries where it is best to do business are countries that treat their own citizens most decently - everywhere in the world .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 10.00 a.m.
each Member of this House should have to get up and go to bed every day with the thought that he or she will cost , or has cost , the taxpayer EUR 6 400 that day .
these were the points I made on behalf of this House to the IGC .
we will miss him ; whether he will miss us is another matter .
asylum seekers must be able to have recourse to the law when administrative decisions go against them .
it also sets a clear time scale for detailed analysis of the impact of this new legislative framework in all the Member States .
however , if we want to get enlightened social policies and have the money for enlightened social policies , we have to liberalise our economies .
had she been able to , then the common sense and persuasive skill she could have brought to bear would have been available right from the beginning of the eight weeks .
my group recently went to the Puglia region in Italy , where hundreds of immigrants have been reduced to slavery on agricultural holdings .
however , we must also consider the value of this information , because some of it is misleading and false , misinforming rather than informing people .
this will make the report meaningful in constituencies like mine where unemployment is concentrated in small pockets of poverty in London despite the low unemployment nationally of the UK .
we should use this as a springboard to create , at last , a European department of transport links , but , first and foremost , we should make it easier for pensioners and the elderly to travel between the European capitals . Pensioners love to travel and could have the right to a free travel card for journeys between their capital city or their own town and the capital cities of the other 14 European States .
I hope that the necessary new approaches exist to enable us to advance further in these respects .
I would , in addition , like to emphasise the role of consultation .
we are currently discussing beef meat in Ireland and aid to cotton production in Greece , but there could also be other examples . As far as agricultural spending is concerned , it is perhaps really time to simplify matters .
there is no real reason for the state to be involved .
– Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , sugar reform was one of the most complex Community policy dossiers .
if we now go and slacken the fence around this intellectual property and leave the holes in the fence that currently exist , then we will lose the valuable elements , namely our intellectual property .
secondly , it was frequently said during the debate that the Americans were the only ones to take action .
the authority which , at Parliament &apos;s request , will be responsible for monitoring and supervising those agencies that will operate in Europe is ESMA , the new financial services authority .
 
Syria and the EU have many political , economic and cultural ties and it is our firm wish and honest desire that such ties be strengthened in the future .
the risks of dispersion will increase with new countries joining the EU and with enlargement .
who knows , however , what real public opinion is in the Arab countries ?
the public will also be appreciative if the EU sets itself new goals and takes the sort of actions that make Europeans ’ lives easier and keep them safer .
well then , we and you yourself have the chance to achieve this , and we are certainly determined to do so .
( FI ) Madam President , it is very important to go to the heart of this matter and say that agriculture based on farming families is local in nature , provides employment , strengthens regions , is humane and also takes account of animal protection issues .
I have therefore recommended that special funding be set aside to promote female researchers and to focus on the importance of networks and role models as simple initiatives , which have produced positive results in the Member States .
I can only subscribe to what Mrs Ferrero-Waldner has said .
thus has ensured the simplification of citizens &apos; lives , namely the recovery of child maintenance from the parent or other debtors when such persons reside in a different country to the child , implementation of one of the European fundamental rights , the right to private and family life and child protection , homogenization and simplification of the European legal norms on the entire EU territory and construction of the European space of freedom , security , justice and facilitation of internal market operation .
we should not be afraid of participation and democracy , because it is the only way in which the new Europe of peoples , of rights and of the Constitution will really be a strong and empowered Europe .
at the same time , we must consider how we can continue to bolster the constructive forces in Zimbabwe .
amendments 6 , 24 and 36 imply that preference should be given to the former mining site of Almadén for the storage of mercury .
Commission statement on BSE
thank you very much Mr Wijsenbeek .
Mr President , the reply received recently by President Buzek from Prime Minister Netanyahu justifying his refusal to allow this Parliament &apos;s delegation to enter Gaza last December requires a robust response .
for many , the European Union is a relatively well-balanced pole of development that attempts to preserve economic dynamism and social justice .
regulation and self-regulation in the professional services sector must be in line with the Lisbon Strategy , in particular with the protection of the general interest , and must not result in discrimination , particularly discrimination on grounds of race , ethnic origin , nationality or gender .
I echo the conclusions of the rapporteur , especially those that concern the importance of SMEs to European economies and the need to facilitate access to finance as well as the need for greater encouragement for SMEs to enhance innovation , thus increasing competitiveness .
this sort of policy would help to reverse the rate of abandonment of mountain and mainly barren areas and , at the same time , make the European Union self-sufficient in sheep- and goatmeat .
would it not be more correct , legally speaking , to place the measures under the third pillar and act at an intergovernmental level ?
in doing so , we make an active contribution , qualify workers and take all kinds of regional initiatives for the years following the crisis .
the French Socialist delegation has voted for Mrs Stauner &apos; s report postponing the granting of discharge for the financial year 1998 , because it resulted from a compromise by our political group with the Group of the European People &apos; s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats and the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party .
I am not really satisfied with the response and the answer we have had from Commissioner Nielson .
. ( FR ) We support the principles that underpin the creation of the Cohesion Fund .
Madam President , rapporteur , the report we are discussing argues for the redesigning of current links between emergency actions , the rehabilitation phase and development processes , so as to make European intervention more effective .
Caudron report ( A4-0138 / 98 )
however , there are also situations where the exchange of market information can be misused , for instance , when companies use sensitive information to coordinate behaviour .
the agreement may serve as an example to the rest of the world .
I do not feel that this is what has happened so far with the measures announced .
the recognition of the principle of social dialogue must therefore not be reduced to the traditional field of socio-political problems , but should be extended to cover all regulatory intentions which are clearly of social relevance .
I await the reactions to this before my second turn .
increased profit and market control by multinationals has been at the expense of small family farms .
more and more Europeans are seeking healthcare in a Member State other than their own , but they often do so without having the first idea of what their rights are in this area .
it therefore requests a breeders &apos; exemption , enabling the further development of plant varieties to take place freely .
moreover , Brazil often acts as an informal bridge between Western and emerging and developing countries .
to conclude , I should like to touch briefly on thematic priorities , without going into the merits of individual arguments .
when she got to the airport she was subjected to a full body search .
we need to put into practice the shared commitment to youth and to employment .
one thing is for sure : the future commissioners did not commit themselves on any one of the points that we consider essential .
we should attach the greatest value to the absolute principle of equal status for all debates in this House , whenever they take place .
the Israeli Government , owing to internal political pressures , was unable to secure the implementation of the treaty , and the country ended up going to the polls prematurely .
I could also take account - and I am saying so here in this Parliament - of the financial impact of the delay on the new Member States .
by 2050 , there will be two billion more people on the face of the earth and 90 % of these will be born into what is now the developing world .
at the same time , however , they are aware that their little country has been abandoned .
it is created by a chemical reaction between sunlight and oxides of nitrogen and volatile organic compounds derived mostly from vehicle emissions and petrol distribution .
I could give you a whole list of countries which , basically , would be interested and eager to join Europe , thereby changing its very nature . Europe is not a customs agreement ; it is not an area of free trade .
the Commission will draw up an interim report after completion of the first step of the selection procedure and a final report once the procedure is finished .
I await the Commission &apos;s very considered opinion .
I am very grateful for the comments made by Mrs de Palacio and all of you here and thank you very much for your work .
the Commission will of course study carefully the conclusions and the action plan which were decided upon at the conference .
the Commission proposal for a regulation follows on from the Court of Justice ’ s ruling on the bilateral ‘ open skies ’ agreements between Member States of the EU and the United States of America , concluded in the 1990s by some Member States and deemed to contravene Community law .
I firmly believe that this important collection of legal regulations will support and facilitate road transport and will help stimulate economic recovery .
employment - social security - structural measures
finally , a few words about the title of your oral questions .
composition of committees and delegations : see Minutes
the way in which the cross-compliance system is implemented in Member States is different .
that distorts competition .
many Member States have banned trilucent implants and have banned saline implants .
we have devised a strategy for all of this : the Europe 2020 strategy .
the idea is that digital libraries , digital equipment for recording journeys , biometric passports and -government will bring miracles to pass .
but although that is accepted in principle by both parties , the efforts to achieve it have not yet produced tangible results , in fact there are fears on one side that it would result in some kind of recognition of Turkish Cypriot identity and on the other that a unified island would not give the Turkish Cypriots proper guarantees .
this also concerns the Commission &apos;s attitude to terminal dues , as referred to in the Reims II agreement .
I believe that the two reports demonstrate a European reality which is very different to that of other territorial political entities and models .
it is a question of bringing about an approximation between the Member States &apos; legislation , not of transferring the right of decision from national legislation to the EU .
this Resolution is also important for the reason that it highlights what always happens in war and conflict zones , that it is always women who are the main victims .
as the study needs to collate all the available knowledge on the subject , it is a complex task , and , as it has to do with the military sector , this has often not been easy .
therefore , it was also important to us Social Democrats to tie in the 2011 budget with a debate that has a more long-term perspective : about own resources , the budget ceilings for 2012 and 2013 , and the financing of the new financial support mechanism .
so if the House is supporting the Council and Commission , I see no reason why it should not support our compromises and compromise text and get those into the Parliament resolution .
this collective lie , which says that Turkey must enter the Union , is disgraceful , since each of them , in silence , is hoping that the other one will say ‘ no ’ and take responsibility for the breakdown .
I congratulate the rapporteur for her outstanding work and the encouraging result achieved .
the same arrangements should apply to ventures supported by the European Investment Bank .
co-operatives are perfectly suited to particularly those regions lacking capital .
do we condemn Sharon &apos; s policy of adopting the worst possible line ?
moreover , through the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument , the EU Common Foreign and Security Policy ( CFSP ) is also to receive a further EUR 70 million in funding .
there is also a constitutional dimension to the European Union itself , however , insofar as not only is the architecture of its institutions subject to the law but there are also guarantees enshrined in law to protect the position of individuals with regard to the government authorities in Europe , and there exists an essential principle , that of democracy , which exalts pluralism .
the European Institute of Innovation and Technology will make an important contribution to the transfer of technology from science to industry and to enterprises .
setting common standards for all Member States on respecting and protecting the individual rights of suspects , defendantsor those convicted in criminal proceedings , as the Commission proposed in its Green Paper , would be useful .
that is the proof of the matter .
it is line with the Commission &apos;s position on how the crisis affects women and how responses to it should take into account the impact on women .
the referenda were the culmination of a long and detailed negotiating process led by the United Nations .
time permits only a couple of remarks on my part .
Madame President , vehicle exhaust emissions are currently the largest single source of atmospheric pollution .
in addition , these functions and professions must be closely interlinked if we want social and cultural development to be genuinely and fully humane .
it is out of tune with our wish for a more efficient global market in line with the objectives agreed during WTO discussions , namely a global market with increased demand and where quality and protection of the environment are given higher priority both at home and abroad .
ladies and gentlemen , our common position must be that such an accident must never happen again .
after all , as the Commissioner said , the individual pieces of legislation - the water legislation , waste legislation and clean air legislation - already contain the requirement to collect this data .
that is why we have agreed to start negotiating a stabilisation and association agreement with that government and that is why we completed those negotiations for an agreement before completing them with anybody else .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all let me give very warm thanks to the rapporteur .
the crisis that has now been triggered by the dramatic rise in imports from China is not , however , affecting companies in the European Union alone ; it is those in some of the world ’ s poorest countries , Bangladesh for example , that are primarily affected .
I also agree with Mr Claeys that it is essential to take very firm action against those countries that abuse the programme , potentially for their own self-armament .
therefore we take it as given that the individual Member States will take part appropriately in financing this , and that the danger of their being knocked out by other , more economically competitive , projects will not threaten programmes targeted at safeguarding biodiversity .
you can therefore expect an increase in tensions , to which our debates today are only a prelude .
in two days &apos; time , we shall have the debate and the decisions of the European Council on Agenda 2000 and the financial perspective .
to pursue that objective , the Commission promotes language learning and linguistic diversity through its programmes for education and training as well as through many other exchange programmes .
consumers must be told where they can get this information and be informed of their rights in the circumstances .
as regards the extension of Socrates to the CCEE , this initiative is still in its infancy ; it is being developed and satisfactory progress is being made , naturally at an appropriate pace .
an integrated approach is needed , and education - particularly for women - is also a key to tackling population problems effectively .
the report directly relates to patients &apos; rights and European lawmakers here must ensure that equality is applied consistently to the provision of healthcare for women and men .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
I am glad that Mr Balčytis raised the issue of tourism in the Baltic region : tourism is not an issue that exclusively concerns the economies of Mediterranean countries - Spain , France , Italy , Greece and Malta .
different services are expressing their opinions , so it is at an advanced stage of internal preparation today .
it is , however , all the more important that , if they can afford a proper holiday during the crisis , our citizens can also return from this holiday satisfied .
what happened beyond that was that there was a relatively small group of hooligans who are very active internationally , whom we have seen before in other circumstances and whom I fear we may see again in the future .
the case law of the Court of Justice has established that , subject to certain conditions , patients have the right to have the cost of healthcare received in other Member States assumed by the social security system in their own Member State .
I would now like to comment on the nine reports .
it is for that reason that my criticisms are primarily directed at the Council .
we are still waiting for the rich rewards , though .
after all , liquidity is a matter of life and death for every enterprise .
however , we should not lose sight of the fact that although SARS is often referred to as a &apos; killer pneumonia &apos; , estimates indicate that it kills fewer people than &apos; normal &apos; influenza .
they are often hampered by the use of too many different bottle types .
in this connection , I would like to make it clear that my group is very concerned particularly if , in Tampere , the areas of collaboration between police forces , the fight against drugs , data protection and the democratic control of Europol and the Schengen information system are discussed , because we are again afraid , that it is exactly these important points , which have really great significance for European democracy , which will come off badly and that the citizens in general will find in the end that , as far as their rights are concerned , they are the real losers .
firstly , we invite the Commission , when it submits its annual draft EU budget proposal , to submit information at the same time , on official posts that are vacant or have been reorganised during the year .
moving on to the structural funds , the Council notes the persisting and major problem of an excessive concentration of commitments and payments towards the end of the financial year .
for all these reasons I am proud to give him my full support .
rather , I think that the ground had not been prepared and that the Constitution had to compete with rivals doped up with lies .
if we are discussing today whether munitions containing uranium do or do not cause leukaemia , then I have no desire to hear anyone tell us , not even Dr Solana , whom I greatly respect , whether or not there is definitive proof .
enlargement is the EU &apos;s absolutely most important priority .
President of the Spanish Government . - ( ES ) Mr President , I will very briefly make two points on the issues that have been raised most insistently : immigration policy and the regularisation of the situation of migrants in Spain .
this is not just a warning from the European Parliament to Azerbaijan , but also an important message to the entire South Caucasian region .
the Council has a certain margin and foundation on which to build , even it is based on the past , which we may think is not particularly well-balanced .
I shall consider your request .
my concern is that it will take some time through natural wastage to effect their removal and I would ask the Commissioner to examine ways of expediting this process .
my question is : will the Commission take the lead in this ?
Madam President , I , like my previous colleague , also voted against the budget .
it is unacceptable for the Greek government not to accept as a debater our party , which obtained 4.5 % here and 6 % in the opinion polls , precisely because it feels threatened by our ascent .
equally , there can be no &apos; one-size-fits-all &apos; solution to the challenges facing the region .
in any case , I would like to conclude by acknowledging the work , the support and all the contributions made by the different groups so that this text could be a consensus and a compromise , and could clearly highlight the problem as well as what is and should be the solution .
in addition , you should know that , on 4 June 1998 , the Council approved the recommendation for a pan-European type of parking permit to be introduced for people with special needs , the aim of which is to help them travel in all Member States with a common permit so that they can take advantage of all organised parking areas throughout Europe .
my second example concerns expropriation and the subsequent compensation .
what I want to highlight , then , is that we in this House also share in responsibility for this , for having expressed too little opposition to the discrimination against the Russian minority in the Baltic states .
perhaps , however , my words are of small yet double importance since I am the President of one of the minority groups which listened to the two candidates : the candidate who has been elected President and also the excellent other candidate , Mrs Catherine Lalumière .
this report is a development of the common immigration and asylum policy under the Lisbon Treaty .
it is as simple as this .
concerning drilling operations , I would like to insert &apos; by EU and third countries &apos; .
I think that in fact we will see all Member States complying with that section of the directive relating to junior doctors within that nine-year time frame .
it would , however , have been vital to state that the European Union &apos;s external action is now , first and foremost , the projection and defence of its own policies : a common trade policy ; a common agricultural policy ; a common fisheries policy , etc .
one of the priorities will have to be to increase the efficiency of port operations and reduce waiting times in ports .
the European institutions and the Member States , foremost among which are Italy and Spain , together with European businesses , have strong interests in that area , which appears to be one of the growth poles of the world economy .
ladies and gentlemen , it is a great pleasure for me to welcome the members of the delegation from the parliament of the Republic of Moldova , who are here in Strasbourg on the occasion of the 11th meeting of the EU-Moldova Parliamentary Cooperation Committee which took place yesterday and today .
but you must understand that the message you are now delivering is complete news to me since even during the Membership negotiations it was said that the steel , cars and shipping sectors would not be entitled to transport aid .
a specific definition which relates to the fact that the FIFG Fund provides specific and differentiated cover and insurance for pollution by hydrocarbons - which other possible types of potential pollutants lack - and furthermore , in the field of criminal penalties , we also believe that pollution by hydrocarbons or by the cleaning out of bilge has a component which requires a specific type if penalty or which , at least , can require that other types of ecological crime are not treated as such a crime , with criminal penalties in some countries .
the driving forces of our economy are fleeing , only to be replaced by immigration on a huge scale , the negative contribution of which is an unbearable economic and social burden .
firstly , two Members , one of whom was Mr Batten , mentioned specific examples of how citizens are affected - perhaps in another country - and it is their opinion that conditions are not very good .
they have broken the rules and it is for others to pursue this matter under the national implementation legislation .
( BG ) Ms Bowles , I admire your desire to overcome tax fraud at European level .
we are entitled to them , both as patients and as service providers .
I was merely stating a fact .
whatever criticism there has been , and however well-founded it may have been , I want to repeat my warm thanks to Mr Jacques Santer and the college at this point !
we did hear that such a proposal might appear even within the next two years .
the Total Allowable Catch for hake is divided up into four administrative areas .
the average corporation tax rate , for example , fell by a total of 15 percentage points across the old EU from the end of the 1980s onwards .
sector studies have comprehensively shown how 10-12 % of users who go to hospitals in Europe to be cured of their illness each year become ill through hospital-acquired infections .
everyone can see that the idea would not work , but no one dares to say so publicly and to scrap the proposal .
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting : see Minutes
. Mr President , the Commission welcomes the outcome of the conciliation process and is pleased that the co-legislators decided to more than double the recycling target by 2008 .
I would like to see far more attention given to improving the everyday existence of immigrants , minorities and those who , for one reason or another , face discrimination .
he has a special association treaty with us .
that is what will make us strong .
question No 19 by María Izquierdo Rojo ( H-0349 / 99 )
they have re-examined the commitments that they made in the Gothenburg Protocol and have signed up to more action .
moreover , for Christian communities such as this one , not being recognized also means that they are regarded as a sect and even have difficulties with importing Bibles .
I have intentionally not registered during these interruptions to the order of business in order not to delay any further .
something must therefore be done about it , and it is more difficult to do this with the recast procedure than with a full legislative mandate .
at the same time they convert the major part of their outstanding public debts into euros , pursuant to Council Regulation No 974 / 98 of 3 May 1998 .
the updating investigation concludes that the findings of the first investigation as concerns the sectors of container ships and product and chemicals tankers were confirmed , namely that the Korean subsidies in question were causing adverse affects to the EU industry within the meaning of the WTO Subsidies Agreement .
a number of Member States , including the Netherlands , have expressed doubts as to whether this directive is really necessary , since their energy sectors are already taking action in this field .
young people simply need to see what future prospects they would have in maritime transport .
it is also important that consumer organisations identify this subject as a priority in order to allocate the necessary resources .
I only know the Commission ’ s position , which I have defended or stated here .
is work being done on one , and when will it be produced ?
very significant humanitarian aid is therefore being provided to Iraq .
the decommissioning schemes put in place must ensure that the MAGP does not simply transfer the problem to other parts of the world .
as we have seen - and as the whole world knows - the US administration was forced to print more money , USD 700 billion in the first stage and a further USD 600 billion in the very recent second stage .
in the early stages there will always be an increase in public spending or a reduction in revenue , and that can only be possible with a profound change in the budgetary rules in force .
that is still true .
please allow me to outline the reasons for maintaining our position .
we call on the Commission to put together a voluntary code of conduct , working with rather than lecturing to companies operating in repressive countries , in an effort to reduce the capacity to prevent freedom of expression .
Mr President , I would like to begin by echoing what has been said by Mrs Muñiz and Mrs Bilbao , because I believe the first thing we need to do is show the European Union &apos;s solidarity with the Chilean people and Chilean institutions , which are very well represented by President Bachelet and President-elect Piñera .
but that should not blind us to the fact that the enlargement strategy has still not actually been revised in certain areas , namely with regard to aid , transparency and parity .
however , past experience is less encouraging than was indicated yesterday by several Members during the debate .
we should have had a method for the effects on health last year , and for the effects on the environment now in 2003-2005 .
if the Council is aware of this , what will it be doing about it ?
indeed the Amsterdam Treaty , if ratified , makes it clear in article 3 that the European Community in all its activities has to have the aim of eliminating inequalities .
there are such wide gaps between the various European economies in terms of productivity and efficiency that , in my opinion , this is the area that we need to concentrate on if we want to secure a competitive future for the economies of the leading countries , for we will certainly not achieve this by taking the deceptive shortcut of lowering interest rates .
Madam President , I am concerned about the delay which Sweden has now negotiated for itself .
I am pleased to note , from the work of your committee and the report by your rapporteur , that the views of your Parliament broadly coincide with the opinions expressed numerous times by the Eurogroup , of which I am privileged to be President .
while ensuring these sensitive procedures for an infinitely small sector of goods transport we must not , however , forget those for which procedures must be simple and practical .
in future the Council should take greater care to ensure that Parliament is duly involved .
I believe that the role it plays towards the outside , expressing the views and the criteria of the eurozone countries , is greatly appreciated .
a green label for sustainable timber and a red label for incorrectly produced timber .
the first aspect concerns competition .
however , the Treaty of Lisbon does , now , foresee such a procedure .
that is why the regulation we are now considering will not just promote the recovery of the ozone layer : it is also an important part of the fight against climate change .
fixed prices allow a wide range of suppliers and titles and protect against competition .
the central question in this context is : what can the European Union do for patients ?
in conclusion , I should like to say that thanks to your intervening , Commissioner , important progress has been made on this directive , and I should specifically like to thank you for that .
the Commission has presented a proposal for the setting-up of a Joint Undertaking to complete the development phase of Galileo ; this would provide a single management structure with legal personality which would be flexible and capable of concluding the necessary contracts .
when one has to wait months to get a reply to questions relating what is currently going on in Eurostat – that is , questions relating not to the distant past but to the mistakes being made right now and to the continued waste of taxpayers ’ money – then nothing has happened .
we believe we need political coherence in our policy-making in this area .
even if the Egyptians wanted to stop terrorists in Sinai , they are therefore not allowed to .
in my view , that is a very good reason not to permit the EU to sign the convention .
I would like to thank the co-rapporteurs , Mr Dimitrakopoulos , Mrs De Keyser and Mr Lagendijk , for their help and constructive cooperation , and the Commission too for its constructive and supportive cooperation .
I do not understand why people say that paternity leave does not benefit the health of working mothers .
as was concluded at that meeting , we must ensure the openness and transparency of national markets , a gradual reduction of gas prices ( an area in which there are still enormous disparities between Member States ) , improve interconnection capacities and the problems ensuing from low capacities and remedy the lack of proper rules on charging for cross-border trade in energy .
this report requests the replacement of UCLAF with an anti-fraud office - OLAF - whose jurisdiction would extend to all the European institutions and which would be supervised by a supervisory body appointed by the European Parliament in agreement with the other institutions .
next there is the decision , proposed by the Group of the European People ’ s Party ; to request a Commission statement on the Eurostat case , with a resolution . Lastly , there is a proposal for a motion of censure tabled by part of the PPE .
with regard to drug trafficking , the Iranians , who have a very serious drug problem of their own , should be commended for their efforts and cooperation .
as you perhaps are aware , immediately after Mr Chevènement made these remarks , I issued a press statement to express my personal outrage at such comments , which I considered quite out of order .
I would like some clarity about what precisely the Commission is doing .
happily , all these changes are , on the whole , improvements .
in your speech , you described animals being transported for slaughter as of low value .
this Vienna strategy , which is the outcome of Pörtschach , clearly sets out the priorities : employment , growth and stability , improving internal security and the quality of life , guaranteeing stability and prosperity and enhancing Europe &apos;s political role in the world and , of course , the necessary political and institutional reforms .
we still need a liveable wage , and flexicurity has to take into account financial security for individuals .
I therefore ask - and I would ask the Commissioner to take this on board - that not only the Council and the Commission participate in the Baltic Sea Strategy , but also that Parliament is properly involved in this cooperation and in the implementation of this strategy , because we would like other regions to profit as well , as with the Black Sea policy or with cooperation between the states bordering the Danube .
it would therefore be very useful if the Council committee on Budgets would also recognize that important budget lines which are relevant for the citizens of Europe , like those on information , NGOs , development , environment and consumers , are not simply cut nearly to zero , thereafter using the margin on Parliament &apos;s part to restore it .
thank you , Mr Kofi Annan , for doing more than ourselves to engage with the most important matters in the world , and thank you for your moving speech .
thus , they duly bear in mind the interests of both the enterprises themselves and other stakeholders .
it is impossible , inconceivable , that the unemployment afflicting 20 million citizens in Europe can be eliminated if we do not achieve the political union that will give impetus and power to economic union .
the project to create so-called ‘ regional protection ’ areas in countries such as Belarus is also in keeping with this idea .
we are here again today to adopt the mobilisation of a European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) assistance package totalling EUR 382 000 to support the Spanish automotive industry .
in effect , I feel an EU logo would be meaningless , a waste of time and money and I feel the same way about the EU logo for organic produce .
I very much welcome this Commission proposal .
finance is a very positive story to tell , and I hope that insurance will be added to the list of progress that has been made so far in this area .
this is not just a problem for the year 2000 , it is an ongoing problem .
we need to find answers to questions relating to the contribution of the whole potential labour force and to our knowledge about the various groups in society : women and men , young people , the elderly and migrants on the labour market .
all democrats should call for his immediate , unconditional release .
protecting individuals with regard to information , is a difficult and hit-or-miss endeavour .
the appointment of Mr Borg , Malta ’ s foreign minister , as its Commissioner , shows the value that Malta attaches to its accession to the EU .
the protection of consumers against loss of personal data and against spam has also been strengthened , particularly by requiring operators to notify consumers in case of personal data breaches and by strengthening the principle of user consent when it comes to use of cookies .
change in Turkey means meeting its obligations towards Cyprus by recognising the Republic of Cyprus and ending the occupation of Cyprus .
while I endorse both directives , I have tabled an amendment to Article 15 ( 4 ) of the WEEE directive inserting a new subparagraph based on a similar clause in Article 52 of the relatively recent EC Directive 99 / 31 on the landfill of waste .
the next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on Aids .
let me comment briefly on just three of the main issues that will be on the agenda of the Luxembourg Presidency ; there are many others , but I wish to concentrate on three .
that is taking matters too far .
while we now have legislation on the promotion of electricity generation from renewable energy and on the promotion of biofuels , the production of heating and cooling from renewable energy – the third pillar of the renewable energy portfolio – lacks a specific strategy .
there have been a series of changes , new laws in Turkey .
I welcome this motion which addresses the important issue of how mainstreaming the needs of the disabled into development policy might be achieved and how issues such as stigma towards disabled people , treatment and care are being dealt with .
I think our proposals from Parliament should be understood in this sense .
the directive on equal treatment should therefore not come into being at all .
STOA , this House ’ s Committee for scientific technology options assessment , is organising nano-cafés , which are happening in Brussels on 18 October , and you are all warmly invited .
first and foremost , we need to widen the legal entry channels , turn the matter into a Community one and amend the Dublin II agreements and , lastly , close all the administrative detention centres located on European soil .
poor districts are also to be found within large conurbations .
I know that Hans-Gert Poettering is very attractive , but I would really prefer people not to take photos in the Chamber .
 
I have not been able to read the text in the other languages of the European Union , but first of all , I would like to know whether there has been a political misunderstanding which has caused the Italian version to be wrong , or whether the French and English versions are wrong .
the proposed article on openness is a small step forward .
evidence has now been produced of Parliament &apos;s faith in the market and those who operate within it . And , as elected representatives , we have broken new ground .
it establishes a partnership framework under criteria of sustainable and responsible fishing , preserving biological resources .
the next item is the Commission statement on aid for Pakistan and possible implication for the European industrial sector .
in May 1994 , at the beginning of the election campaign for the European Parliament , I was insulted and my honour was called into question by António Campos , now my colleague in this Parliament .
although unquestionable progress has been made in the last 10 years in terms of product requirements in the internal market of the European Union - partly thanks to a common approach - much still remains to be done .
so far as we know , no other international organisation pays interest in cases of late payment .
you quoted the relevant passage in the Rules of Procedure , thus dispelling any doubts , and you then noted the conclusion of the vote by stating , &quot; rejected &quot; .
as Mrs Joly said , 80 % of the recent loans from the IMF went to European countries and only 1.6 % of these new loans were granted , for example , to African countries .
by limiting the number of man-hours lost , prevention also helps to increase the productivity and employability of workers , two indicators which are in keeping with the Lisbon process .
a whole raft of issues that are crucial to the task of ensuring that South Africa is in a position to maximise the opportunities afforded by this agreement now need to be explored in a holistic way .
this colonial war claims more and more victims .
all the ideas that seek to limit the maximum rate of VAT , including that proposed by President Sarkozy of France , are worthy enough and should be investigated , and I would like to put forward one of my own .
it is a litany of a failed policy , of failure to control a contract , of failed financial control , of failure to disclose the faults , of failure to remedy the deficiencies , of failure to accept culpability and , above all , of failure to come clean at the earliest possible opportunity .
all of the results were put on paper and signed by our Heads of State and Government at the Nice Summit .
however , these plans to reduce the number of vessels must be formulated by Member States and some of these programmes have to be approved by the European Commission , because the financial resources for the programmes will come from the existing European Fisheries Fund .
this means more operational and financial responsibility will be left to the Member States , and for that it is necessary , as a guarantee of the interest of the Union in its entirety that a wide spectrum of interested groups takes part in the decision-making process .
4 . Mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to taxes , duties and other measures (
in addition to the HORIZON employment initiative , significant resources are also targeted on people with disabilities through the mainstream structural fund programmes .
it will be impossible to create an effective protective umbrella against this hazard unless Europe and the US cooperate to this end .
the obvious danger if we do not achieve this is that we end up having spats with precisely the people we should be teaming up with against this American behaviour .
we also condemn Israel ’ s attacks on the Palestinian administration ’ s infrastructure .
as Mr Lehne has already said , we are largely agreed among ourselves on the need for a case-by-case examination of all legal acts , which are in need of renovation .
I have just returned from Davos , where discussions between trade ministers reinforced the need to get back to the negotiating table and , of course , the technical discussions are continuing in Geneva .
we need to reform the Security Council .
the main source of Community grants to short sea shipping has in the past been the PACT Programme , that is a Pilot Action for Combined Transport .
world history shows that the quest for peace pays off in the end .
in a democracy , it must be possible to talk about change , conduct negotiations and then bring forth legislation to achieve change .
your team , Mr Prodi , faces a double challenge of which the first , which you have mentioned at length , is the restoration of the trust of the citizens and parliamentarians .
Mr Trichet , your performance in office to date has helped to ensure , and indeed further enhance , the European Central Bank ’ s credibility and independence .
it has already been said that they failed to spot the crisis coming .
however , I believe we should not rotate Commissioners absolutely equally amongst all Member States , but some mathematical formula must be found to preserve , at least in a semi-permanent presence , the Commissioners of the big Member States - but I know this is controversial .
the answer is obvious : by asking them about the future and by listening to their answers .
the essential complement ...
the vote will take place tomorrow morning .
if you think back , it was a year ago that the great crisis occurred , with the failure of a financial proposal from the Luxembourg Presidency – a proposal , I might add , that was not all that far removed from the one we have adopted today , and so I would like to take this opportunity to say a very big thank you to Jean-Claude Juncker , who deserved to see this day in his presidency .
one of the lessons to be learnt from this saga is that the IGC must refine the decision-making structures of the European Union to ensure that there is no repetition of these circumstances when one Member State is able to hold the entire European Union to ransom .
and as for non-governmental organisations , they are even worse off and , unless they are officially involved in social dialogue , local society will not , I fear , look on them as serious , efficient partners .
the Commission is also working closely with the European Investment Bank to identify common projects in the infrastructure sector .
in this way , positive development of the regions is also possible , because people will start business and will work if they are given the chance .
fortunately , the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety thoroughly aligned itself with the Commission &apos;s proposal .
neither can we agree to any privileges for ourselves that we cannot extend to our citizens .
you have said many good things , and there are many good things in the communication .
this was also said a moment ago .
my favourite saint is Francis of Assisi , and he did not only love people , he loved animals as well .
.
most of Europe &apos;s citizens are unaware of the achievements that have been made possible by the policies and financial resources of the European Union .
we have had some discussion of the EU counter-terrorism coordinator .
naturally , there is an objection .
public trust in politics has been seriously damaged .
the regret is that I listened , with some surprise , to the debate held on the preamble to decide whether our religious , or rather Christian , heritage should be included among the factors making up our common identity .
the European Union has always supported the principle of the shortest route and that means that we need the appropriate transit routes through Switzerland .
groundbreaking achievements are only possible on the basis of well-planned long-term investments .
I do not complain about being accused of being unduly ambitious - that is the benchmark for what I do and how I set about my job .
that being so , the request that the Commission draw up a programme of action to combat Alzheimer &apos;s disease and related illnesses is more opportune than ever and has our firm support .
( PL ) Madam President , Monday &apos;s arrests in Copenhagen show that terrorism is still a real threat in Europe .
you have completely confused me , because you did not speak on any of the subjects on the agenda .
therefore , they must objectively and rigorously account for how the public funds made available to them have been used .
this is a duty , Mr President-in-Office .
I voted in favour of this motion for a European Parliament resolution because the respect , promotion and guarantee of the universality of human rights are an integral part of the European Union &apos;s legal acquis and it is one of the EU &apos;s fundamental principles .
the Commission expects the trade volume to double soon after the agreement is signed .
( RO ) I would like to use this opportunity to speak in the European Parliament plenum about the history of the NATO Summit hosted by Bucharest , the capital of Romania , on 2 - 4 April .
the aim is to reach a certain level of harmonisation in order to upgrade security standards in two exceptional cases .
I must , however , make two observations .
on behalf of the Socialist group I very much welcome this amendment to our Rules of Procedure , which will enable Parliament to deal much more efficiently and speedily with proposals to simplify European legislation , either through codification of existing legislation , without changes of substance , or else through recasting proposals where changes of substance are combined with the simplification of existing legislation .
to do this , we absolutely must have European coordination .
it was very impressive to see this , and it substantiated the demands made in the report and allowed us to experience what they involved .
two aspects require particular attention , beginning with the financial parameters .
in other words , wherever we maintain unanimity , Parliament will not have the legitimate , democratic , important role which it will have in all cases requiring a qualified majority , cases which , as far as Parliament is concerned , and because of the democratic way in which it functions , should be the general rule .
if we know that , in the next few years , we will be faced with a decrease in the number of young people and an increase in the number of older people in our working population , this means that we must adapt our social security systems to those demographic factors .
first , there is the problem of democracy , social justice and ecology in Europe .
the people of Europe , whom we represent here in Parliament , will also find it easier to identify with a common foreign and security policy .
we do not seek to remove the item from topical and urgent debate .
he is absolutely right .
if we do not react together , if the EU does not react , the migratory wave of displaced people will continue .
the process of updating this programme , which was adopted in April 1995 , is currently under way in the Commission .
we want less red tape , also because the impact of the introduction of this directive is only assessed after the event and not before .
I should also like to express my confidence that , through further constructive discussions with your representatives - but also with the Commission - we will produce a good budget for 1999 , a budget which is good for the people of Europe .
indeed , here I hope you will not adopt the Stoiber formulation referred to by Mr Barón Crespo .
the new Commission is to be approved by Parliament , which will also vote in the new Commission President on the basis of the Commission &apos;s programme .
it is up to the Commission and the Council now to pick up the thread of our proposals and above all to embrace the democratic spirit in which they were made .
Mr President , I look forward to the day - and I do not think it will be long ahead - when the Court of Auditors is able to give these two agencies a certificate of assurance for &apos; keeping their noses clean &apos; so to speak and for getting good reports from the Court .
we in the PSE Group are not so much concerned with which document we do or do not support but believe the key issue really is whether these guidelines are an answer to the real economic situation , and the key issue is whether they offer any more help in tackling the needs of the people in the European Union .
( IT ) Mr President , the Commission proposal on preventing the entry of falsified medicines into the supply chain highlights a concern that is becoming a priority for all Europeans : the quality and safety of the medicines we use every day .
thinking forward to the first meeting of the committee preparing the conference on the review of this treaty in 2010 , the European Union has already started to do extensive preparatory work at home .
we must intensify negotiations with Turkey all the more .
the criteria for economic and monetary union have caused such phenomena already amongst ourselves .
Mr President , I would finally like to say that Parliament has , for its part , significantly improved the proposal under discussion .
we should also be pleased with the increased concern about the particular vulnerability of women in situations of abuse , and consequently the need to reinforce their protection .
it was probably for fear of stating the obvious that no such mention was made . In fact , there was no such risk .
following the financial crisis , it has become evident that the European financial markets are currently unable to provide SMEs with adequate finance mechanisms .
for this purpose , the Commission is planning to use , among other things , the Innovation Partnerships , which we are currently debating and which are the subject of our cross-group question .
if this is not possible , they need to be granted a fair compensation that allows them to buy a similar property .
I supported the European Parliament resolution on rising food prices in the European Union and developing countries and hope that the European Union will continue improving its development policies and engage further in fair international trade .
it is important for the government of Chad to do all it can to prevent the recruitment of children by rebel groups ; the importance of the role of EUFOR will prove crucial here in , for example , communicating with community leaders and focusing their attention on the situation of children in this area .
( FR ) Mr President , I had not intended to respond as , until Mr Berthu &apos;s speech , all of the speakers had essentially confirmed our deep-seated agreement on the principles .
when a bank is subject to strict supervision by the central bank in its own country , and wants to provide services elsewhere in the Union , the authorities in the other Member State should have confidence that this supervision has been exercised with care and that clients in other Member States are therefore also protected against failings in the area of solvency , liquidity and other requirements .
so I ask you , Commissioner : were you aware of this study ?
I also have people behind my desk who help me in this activity .
direct aid to Palestine is very difficult to control , as certain Members have said , both in terms of its destination and in terms of its application .
after a ten year gap , it was about time for the directive to be thoroughly revised in order to include new commercial channels , such as online shopping .
I must just point out that the &apos; Services Directive &apos; , which has already been referred to here , excludes gambling precisely for reasons of public order and consumer protection .
but not everything is acceptable in the fight against terrorism ; the Rule of Law and international legality must always be respected .
there will probably be far fewer parties to the new fund than to the 1992 fund , since numerous States that were party to the 1992 Fund feel that there is no need for supplementary protection .
let us take the proposal for an independent Prosecutor .
we should also recall that we have worked very closely together in the battle against international terrorism .
written statements ( Rule 149 )
unfortunately , the sad statistics in my state show that in eight out of ten international cases currently being investigated , State institutions or courts are found to have acted improperly .
such change should , however , be managed to avoid speculation to the detriment of the weakest individuals in contractual terms , particularly those who find themselves in disadvantaged situations .
( FI ) Mr President , I am in favour of the introduction of a global transaction charge .
the maize may therefore be used like any other type of maize , but the decision does not of course exclude the application of other EU legislation .
Parliament adopted this at first reading on 30 April 1998 , and the Council adopted a common position on 24 July 1998 .
just for today !
yesterday &apos;s visit to the European Parliament by bishops from Iraq is proof that we still have a huge problem with the persecution of religious groups .
in Finland , the Union &apos;s northernmost Member State , food production is possible thanks to the Gulf Stream .
in accordance with the provisions of the basic anti-dumping regulation the Commission will only adopt provisional methods where imports have been found to be dumped on the Community market and where this dumping has caused material injury to the Community industry concerned .
as soon as this happens , I hope that the Commission will approve these proposals and we will send them to the ESC , to Parliament and to the Council for their final approval .
it is time for the Commission and Parliament to take up this issue .
as for my basic question , thank you , it has been covered .
the cooperation agreement must be signed immediately and an association agreement must be rapidly concluded .
I would , however , like to express our thanks for your good will , your patience , but most of all your decisiveness concerning Europe , without which the outcome of the Brussels summit would not have been possible .
thank you to Birgitte Stensballe and to all of her team ; to the ushers , who make sure that the documents always arrive at the right place , at the right time ; to the technicians ; to the secretaries ; and to the translators .
for 23 years there has been no progress on the issue and we have actually moved backwards . Surely it is now time to reverse that course .
this will only be achieved by a further decentralization of our information services .
I would like to hear what the Commission has to say about this .
but when our Heads of State or Government saw each other they were deeply moved and left the Convention &apos;s draft in peace .
the events of the last few days , involving a cut-off of gas supplies from Russia , has opened eyes to the need to find the quickest possible solution at pan-European level .
Vice-President of the Commission . - Madam President , thank you very much for this debate .
the proposals will reinforce the provisions of the current directive with regard to a central computerized database , a passport for each animal , a double ear-tagging arrangement for identifying each animal and registers of animals on each holding .
the candidate countries , too , engaged in in-depth negotiations not only with regard to the amount to be spent , but also to the structure the expenditure should have .
they are spread through the air and through the food chain very far from their sources , even to regions where they have never been used or produced .
but what will the consequence be ? How quickly do you think criminal organisations will make use of such a legal construct ?
the second exam which we are sitting is in powers of persuasion , i.e. our ability to persuade Turkey of the value of substantive acceptance of our democratic institutions .
at our first reading , the European Parliament considered this action programme to be of undoubted benefit , and greatly improved it through 28 amendments , which among other things provided for the people most directly affected - the sufferers themselves - and their families to be involved in the programme .
there is a lot of talk about smart regulation at the moment , but I think this is a classic example of smart regulation .
these proposals should be rejected .
but I am sure that the whole thing will only become stable once the commitments of nearly ECU 2 billion made by last year &apos;s conference of donor countries become a reality , and soon .
the situation is tragic in the extreme , and I would ask you all to vote in favour of our motion for a resolution .
it is , indeed , such situations that have led to this updating of the regulation , which seeks to strengthen the conditions for granting licences and the economic and financial monitoring of companies .
I have therefore voted in favour of this report .
we were at one time a politically neutral country , during the time of the Iron Curtain .
others have failed to keep their commitments , even increasing their harmful emissions , but no one wants to punish them . After this , how can we expect the signatories to comply with a new agreement , that is , if there will be a sequel to Kyoto in Copenhagen ?
any conflict confirms this .
the consultation and transparency procedure of Article 6 of the framework directive , the authorisation directive and the Commission &apos; s proposal for a regulatory framework on radio spectrum policy provide us with the necessary instruments .
finally , women must be guaranteed equal rights to participate in the measures promoted by the Social Fund not only by including mainstreaming in the regulation but also through specific measures .
1999 - the sixth year running that the Court of Auditors refused to write off the accounts .
written statements ( Rule 149 )
by doing this , it has trodden Parliament &apos;s budgetary rights underfoot .
Commissioner , at times I have been hard on you and the Commission in relation to trade policy .
( Mr President , I would like to draw your attention to the significance of rural development problems in the new Member States .
that is true and you are absolutely right .
regulation is therefore needed very urgently , as technology is all well and good , and can be a boon for the consumer , but we do need to know for sure that the food on our tables is safe .
on a separate matter altogether , I would like to support Cuba &apos; s membership as an ACP country within the framework of the new Lomé Convention which will shortly be agreed between the European Union and African , Caribbean and Pacific countries .
the Committee on Budgets has a large number of questions regarding these figures .
I therefore emphatically voted in favour of this resolution .
as a Parliament we then called on the Commission to improve its infringement procedures and its dealings with complainants , calling in particular for correspondence passing between the Commission and the Member States to be made available .
we have heard some amazing things from Mr Pirker , Mr Santini , Mr Blokland and others which make one wonder how they chose to interpret the remarks in this report .
this is not a problem that affects only one part of the Union ; it affects potentially the whole of the Union .
that is exactly why the draft decision specifies that the political association should be active in at least one-third of the Member States .
ladies and gentlemen , the European Union must support the democratic process and contribute to its success .
as she said , we worked together with an overwhelming majority in the Committee on the Environment on this issue , precisely because we have the impression that our right of codetermination is being curtailed , whatever the legal situation here ; I think we all know that , Mrs Sommer .
I hope that further work on the directive will move towards eliminating this phenomenon .
if we want to promote true change , we need to concentrate on the level at which the problem presents itself ; in other words , what is needed is targeted , complex measures at the level below that of the regions as well .
these are also reflected in the amendments we have tabled .
indeed , the award of the Sakharov Prize in 2008 to Hu Jia showed the world how seriously we MEPs take the issue of human rights in China .
it is also necessary to produce educational tools designed to inform Internet users ( e.g. technologies for managing &apos; traces &apos; left on the web and resources for protecting privacy ) .
the lack of innovation should perhaps be ascribed to the complex legislation that hinders innovation , rather than to a lack of institutes .
I have already asked for this to be rectified .
as rapporteur , I see this as exemplary behaviour , which I would recommend to all current and future Member States .
thank you , Commissioner , for the information which you have given us .
in itself , enlargement of the area in which there is free movement of individuals is naturally a very good thing , but in this particular case I have two observations to make .
if they will be so very small , why not none at all ?
but you also need the support of this House , and I say to the colleagues opposite and to the Liberals : last month , on cars , you let us down on climate change because you watered down the Commission proposals .
a great deal of money in the agriculture sector has just not been recovered because of the difficulties with Member States not cooperating .
.
I am thinking here of situations in which the vendor , even if he or she has been contacted by the consumer , via the Internet for example , has gone to the consumer &apos; s home in order to conclude the contract there . I also have in mind contracts where the consumer has been given an incentive , at the initiative of the other party , the co-contractor , even to leave the state in which he or she is domiciled in order to conclude the contract , as happens , for example , in contractual situations involving holidays organised by the suppliers themselves .
now we see the Federalist majority in the European Parliament taking the view that the Heads of State or Government undertook in 2002 to maintain the first-pillar agricultural funds in full at the same level until 2013 and that that undertaking should be respected .
one problem still remains , which we shall continue to face for a considerable time , and that is the length of time it takes to process cases before the European Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance .
I also believe that the EUR 9 supplementary premium for ewes and she-goats is particularly justified under the more difficult conditions in the less-favoured areas .
at the same time , the inflexible nature of the proposal makes no provision for mechanisms allowing the list of &apos; safe states &apos; to be revised and countries added or removed .
in the past few years Belarus has refused to grant tax exemptions for EU assistance , in breach of earlier commitments between Belarus and the European Union .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - Mr President , I am happy that combating gender-based violence is a priority of both the European Commission and the European Parliament .
I urge the Commission to listen and to implement everything in this report .
we know that food prices account for a great deal of what European citizens have to pay out each month , not least those on the lowest incomes .
in other words , we must ask ourselves how future summits held in European countries need to be organised in order to ensure that the meetings of representatives of the different institutions are productive and not the cause of fruitless , violent controversy .
it is a world which is yet to be conquered at EU level .
I would also like to find out from the Commission what concrete steps it intends to take in terms of ECHO funding , extra funding and emergency aid , but also - and mainly - by way of democratic encouragement of that country through making extra funding available to it through the TACIS programme , possibly in advance of the 2002 budget .
this market test , or impact analysis , is indeed already being applied to some extent , by the broadcasters themselves , among others , but not according to the modalities as these have been set out in the Commission proposal , which look somewhat different .
this way of thinking is fundamentally different from our own vision of a European Community .
if a clause of this type were not included , the whole process of commercial integration which we Europeans have implemented would be cast to the winds .
in real terms , however , and taking into account the previous amendments to the budget , the surplus amounted to over EUR 10 billion , which is equivalent to one tenth of the EU ’ s 2003 budget .
today &apos;s news that the state of emergency will be lifted is also a positive sign .
in each case we coped .
Mr Mulder has already spoken here of the 5 , 000 officials that would be needed to staff it .
and the European Parliament itself must be consistent : for example , at first reading on the budget , when it failed to achieve the majority needed to reject the cuts proposed by the Council , and first and foremost those on the Structural Funds , this was - in my view - a political error , specifically because , as far as the budget goes , its hands were tied in relation to the Council and , to some extent , it accepted the negative message emanating from the Council , namely that this was not the time for development , employment and economic and social cohesion .
I think that is why it has caused concern , from the point of view of its concordance with the principles enshrined in Articles 2 and 3 of the Treaty on European Union and with the political dimension of the rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union .
thanks to the Belgian Presidency &apos;s proactive and intelligent approach , the proposal was supplemented , enhanced and improved , but , as you know , we failed to receive the unanimous support that I had hoped for on this matter .
the first is on young people and smoking .
I would also emphasise that , in these important , but also sensitive , issues to which the space dimension of European security responds , it is good to have a system which is not dependent on the USA , which builds upon increased cooperation between the Member States and which makes better use of resources .
the aim of this communication will be to consult publicly and widely on the options available in the field of consumer collective redress .
( ES ) Madam President , on 18 October , a trial will begin in the Turkish city of Diyarbakir of 28 leaders of the Democratic Turkey Party ( DTP ) .
I condemn this , as well as the Council &apos; s absence .
it also has a lot of sympathy for the amendments submitted by Mr Bushill-Matthews but feels that the Weiler report is not the appropriate report for such amendments .
observation , surveillance and action to ensure application of the rules is unfortunately inadequate in many , if not in most , cases .
this was true of the former Soviet bloc but it is certainly not true of me and those of us supporting the amended report .
this is a very important precedent that sends an extremely clear message : the Commission can and must be firm and thorough with Member States that act as if nothing had happened , and it must use all the tools the democratic system allows : the media and public opinion .
but you cannot get that from animals that are tortured and arrive in the country of destination half-dead .
( NL ) I am therefore pleased that , at this meeting , we agreed what the role of the parliaments would be .
Madam President , a few hours ago , a Basque journalist , Mr Landaburu , was the victim of an attack . Mr Landaburu is well known for his professional work , his commitment to democracy and his opposition to Francoism .
the Council has also rightly decided to double the assistance package for financially distressed non-eurozone countries in eastern Europe , from EUR 25 billion to EUR 50 billion .
many Member States have already made progress in this regard , but much hard work lies ahead if we are to succeed in developing the European higher education area .
those of us who hail from the south of Europe hope that under Mr Prodi , more account will be taken of certain issues which tended to be sidelined by the previous Commission , that is , those issues concerning relations with the southern flank of Europe . Europe has certainly shifted northwards and eastwards in recent years .
we condemn the deaths of people who were acting peacefully .
Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and many of my fellow Members wanted to take account of these positive signals and developments in Turkey after the reform efforts in Turkey came to a standstill last year .
to achieve that goal , we must continue to move forward and I feel we need to think again in terms of reinstating the dynamics of social dialogue and establishing a social Europe ; fresh ideas about what we understand by the &quot; public interest &apos; ; new conceptions regarding the relevance of the world market as an economic reference point ; new methods for incorporating ethics , science and the environment in our policy-making process ; a broader view of trade , encompassing the environment and social rights , an intensification of the multilateral nature of the Union since it has always been to our advantage in the past and will continue to be so in the future ; a strengthening of our ability to act with firmness .
the victims have given us clues to help us in our investigations but are not prepared to testify in court , and so we unfortunately have insufficient evidence to secure a conviction .
we estimate that the operational costs could rise by 3 % if this Directive were to be applied in the field throughout Europe .
the euro is a new currency , it has been well received by global operators since it has become clear that it is really going to come into circulation , and on the global monetary market it will find itself mainly in competition with the dollar , while the ESCB will have a reserve of 400 billion dollars .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament supports the resolution tabled .
I wish to congratulate and thank Mr Tappin for his excellent work .
if I can venture drawing the political lesson from your words , what strikes me as paramount from what you have said – and you seem to be in agreement – is that negotiations and diplomacy are the only way-out .
an economy cannot be competitive , dynamic and healthy in the long term unless the productive , commercial and financial processes are backed up by a stable , cohesive and fair society in which human rights , resources and capacities are properly developed .
to conclude my statement , I should like to underscore that the introduction of the single currency has indeed reinforced the need for the strong involvement of central banks in prudential supervision and financial stability .
the argument that they are belated seems to me misguided .
the inclusion of aviation activities in the European Union &apos;s greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme is a logical step .
why is that the case ?
it will also undoubtedly become clear then what impact the more expensive euro has had on agricultural policy .
great !
Mr Adam has pointed out that we may have to decide between technology development projects on the one hand and scientific research projects on the other .
( CS ) I emphatically voted against this motion for a resolution on the outcome of the 10th EU-Russia Summit .
some Spanish regions such as Galicia , to give an example , have a percentage of the gross domestic product dedicated to infrastructures which is well above the national average .
with this evaluation , this hope and these demands , which are always the demands of the European , radical and ecological Left , I will vote &quot; yes &apos; to the proposal that is being put to us for the launching of the euro .
while there are frequent reports of attacks on refugees , the UNHCR is also very concerned about those on internally displaced persons in Darfur , where women tell how they are raped when they go in search of firewood or water .
what is the Commissioner &apos;s view on whether that is a feasible possibility - to suspend Article 5 ?
a further shipment of over 16 000 tonnes through EuronAid is due to arrive on Sunday .
what are the main measures being taken or prepared by the Commission in the context of cooperation with Angola in the following four areas : humanitarian aid ; social development ; reconstruction ; training for democracy ?
in the relevant report on fraud prevention for 1996 , the Commission stated that 50 % of the irregularities were caused by the failure to submit proper documents and proof of expenditure .
however , we will only achieve these objectives if we do our homework .
we must also remember that Ukraine is a vast country with attractive economic potential and a serious partner in economic relations .
today we will identify it as a clear breach of human rights .
for our part , we would like to emphasise - as the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has long been saying quite clearly - that the only possible way to inject any form of a constructive approach into a constantly deteriorating situation is to openly support the Palestinian Government of National Unity .
there are three aspects of the report and the resolution that I should like to mention .
in petition No. 0795 / 2007 , the facts are presented in a biased and tendentious way , and the party affected - the Bulgarian Orthodox Church - was not asked to present its position .
in the light of these developments , against this constitutional background , and in keeping with their commitment to transparency , Parliament and the Commission have agreed to establish and maintain a joint register in order to keep a list of the names of , and exercise scrutiny over , the organisations and individuals who take part in the drafting and implementation of EU policies .
it is up to the British government to make a statement on these matters .
in order to resume economic growth , we need an alternative model to the one proposed in the package , which is based on strategic investments and creating new jobs .
you have obviously mentioned the need for an agenda for prosperity , stability , solidarity and a Europe that promotes peace and stability .
there have been no changes in the discrimination against ethnic and religious minorities , such as the Kurds and the Christians .
at the same time , however , we are aware that the implementation of this objective will require sustained , long-term efforts and patience .
I should like to state the importance of ensuring that issues pertaining to applicable law are considered appropriately , both by the parties and by the court , thus guaranteeing legal certainty .
these views have since been abandoned , as Australia has ratified Kyoto and in the United States , at both federal and state level , these views are no longer accepted .
the great warlord is no longer Saddam Hussein - it is George W. Bush .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it seems to me that whatever we discuss and decide here will not change anything , either in Thailand or in Transnistria , so it is pointless to change things around .
in the communication on migration , the Commission addresses the issues of external border controls , Schengen governance and organised mobility .
in one way or another , the EU must ensure that its foreign policy is adjusted in such a way that the policy lines adopted are commensurate with the behaviour of the countries with which we work .
the fact that transatlantic relations are now so good surprises some people , but this is merely down to the fact that the EU ’ s policies do not differ in any fundamental way from the line followed by the US Government .
fish meal is used mainly as animal feed in the poultry and pig-rearing sectors .
however , the political will of all is required if we are to create the actual conditions .
for Europe , new members mean new borders and new neighbours .
you surely know , Mr President , that in Chile there has been a pension revolution : whereas pensioners could barely live on the miserable pensions there used to be before , now , through investment in pension funds , regulated and controlled by the State , the size of old-age pensions has bloomed again .
one category within the chemical industry which could do with a little more attention is the small and medium-sized firms .
secondly , it is important for the precautionary principle to be established .
there is an alternative . It is possible and practical to implement and needs only the necessary political will .
this is a robust strategy and is accompanied by a significant increase in the percentage of the research budget covered by ex-post audits .
a major fear is that NEPAD will eventually lead to the enrichment of those who are already rich and the challenge is to see the NEPAD story not as contravening the millennium objectives , such as halving the number of poor who have to survive on less than 1 dollar .
while a few years ago , enormous efforts were being made to combat unemployment by reducing working hours and introducing job sharing , there is now all of a sudden talk of extending the working hours and you mention shorter holidays .
for the Commission , for example , this means that all Commissioners must develop a corresponding willingness to cooperate and to pass it on to their staff .
on the occasion of International Women ’ s Day , I would like warmly to greet those here , and at the same time to draw your attention to another day , not yet well-known , which is to occur on 8 April every year , and which this year falls exactly one month from now , International Roma Day .
the debate is closed .
as for emissions trading , it is an anti-social proposal , and its costs will be borne by ordinary people .
I heard your ruling , but Annex II to the Rules of Procedure says that each Member may put a supplementary to any question .
we have to work harder to restore the trust between old and new Member States .
I would like to give him my sincere thanks for his contribution to the Sixth Framework Programme to establish the European Research Area - it was his idea - and the new instruments , such as integrated networks , networks of excellence , integrated projects and the stairway to excellence .
secondly , it does not indicate any way out of a completely new situation for energy policy as a whole .
it is therefore essential that the investigations in this area shed light on the issue and do not lead to further confusion .
misappropriations of financial aid and the resulting social unrest following this kind of natural disaster are , unfortunately , the rule rather than the exception .
how can a state defend its citizens in such a situation ?
internal taxes have dwindled as a result of the economic slowdown .
similarly , the Commission must support the International Coffee Organisation &apos;s quality-improvement programme .
nuclear power plants under construction near the EU &apos;s external borders must comply with international nuclear safety and environmental protection standards .
nonetheless , one point is that there is already legislation in force , but often citizens &apos; rights are not being respected with in terms of prices , tariffs or tariff transparency , with discriminatory rules that often prevent the comparison of tariffs .
we have taken on political obligations which we cannot evade , even if the political situation in Albania is other than we would wish .
( the President cut off the speaker )
the second point is a regret , Mr President , Commissioner , that our recommendations on methodology have not been followed .
I show my solidarity and congratulate the Portuguese Government for its courage and , why not , also its moral courage when taking this decision .
recent alarming reports by organisations such as Amnesty International , Psy , Human Rights in China and Compass Direct give me cause to question this commitment .
our partnership , if it is to be credible and significant , must support the Tunisians on their road to profound change .
I am delighted to be able to be able to set out the Commission &apos;s position on the report .
we also hope that the European Parliament will be able to examine this issue with equal promptness when it comes before this House under the codecision procedure .
today , I should like to call your attention to the flags of the regions and nations that were not fortunate enough to become a state .
the text reads : &quot; would like the implementation of these four measures and especially the common position on specific measures to combat terrorism to be subject to the interpretation of the definition , as laid down in the framework decision concerning the definition of terrorism that was laid down by the Council on 6 December 2001 , particularly with regard to the guarantees described in the recitals and the relevant statements made by the Council &quot; .
at the same time , faced with the &apos; bitter attacks &apos; by Boeing and the US Congress , against the contract awarded to Northrop Grumman Corporation EADS for the US Air Force aerial tanker recapitalisation programme , the European Parliament seeks to pour oil on troubled waters , by pointing out the need to &apos; to arrive at a pragmatic balance between European civil support and the US military-industrial scheme &apos; .
we support the &apos; communitarization &apos; of common foreign and security policy , and justice and home affairs , because Europe needs to have one voice in an international scene where the language of force continues to be given priority , in a world where the economy is becoming globalized and where organizations without democratic legitimacy , like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund , take the principal decisions .
thank you for your answer .
in this debate and in the subsequent vote , our task is to provide a vital impetus for the eCall system to be developed and rolled out across Europe by 2009 .
but when it is a question of reducing our protection , unanimity is , I believe , useful , because it is not right that a majority should be able to impose measures that damage the interests of a minority of Member States .
in sum , this is a terror state .
effective implementation is connected with better legislation .
that gives you added responsibility during your presidency in terms of finding a definitive solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict .
its neighbours include such major countries as Brazil , in respect of which my colleague Mr Deß has done such exemplary work by ensuring that measures are taken to ensure stability , particularly for agriculture , small-scale farmers and independent farms , along with the slow growth of a small business sector .
there are issues related to compliance with standards in the new Member States , notably in the social and environmental fields .
the violence which flared up in Jerusalem at the end of September showed again that the continuation of the Middle East peace process cannot be taken for granted .
.
hang on a moment , who are we talking about here ?
another of the important consequences , to which Mr Rothley and Mr Florio have referred , is the principle of a legal hierarchy .
however , the footprint is legislative .
this document is purely technical in nature , essentially discussing limits to the competence of the Commission , the Council and Member States , and laying down levels of contamination .
we have set high targets for the European Union &apos;s response to the South Asian crisis , both in Jakarta and in United Nations meetings in Geneva .
hardly any .
if we are to take &quot; Citizens &apos; Europe &apos; seriously , we must succeed in securing the participation of local and regional authorities early enough and to a sufficient degree .
the debate is closed .
thank you , Mrs Ashton , for mentioning the training measures in respect of gender equality and geographical balance in your proactive measures .
if we want to promote the trans-European networks , we need to find ways of funding them and one of these ways is obviously the Community budget .
we give the arguments for and against certain decisions there .
it has nothing to do with the internal single market .
the Budget and the Financial Perspective are work programmes in the form of figures , and today we have started to discuss the policy programme for the next five years .
at the same time , we are losing jobs , and we do not really know how we are to support ourselves in the future .
we must also develop measures to encourage the positive effects of this type of programme , without allowing their increase in number to lead to a fall in quality .
to ensure effective cooperation between the institutions , the Commission should update the European Parliament at every stage of the negotiations on personal data protection .
the directive I wish to present to you today does not focus on the media through which information is transmitted but on content ; it deals with audiovisual services , whatever medium is used to deliver them to the public .
here for the first time we have an opportunity to develop the Union on three institutions - the traditional European Community , the Economic and Monetary Union and the political union - freely , that is without extreme pressure from outside as was the case during the Cold War with its threat of nuclear strikes .
with the proposed resolution , we are confirming the anxiety that was expressed a year ago .
it must never happen again .
this is ultimately what the citizens of Europe expect of their leaders .
the approach taken in the Jarzembowski report is to bring the management of railway undertakings into line with private sector management as much as possible and to introduce the pressure of competition .
politically , the EU &apos;s contribution is less commendable .
this new instrument also allows us to respond to the continuing credit crunch .
in particular , we would like to highlight the issue of religious tolerance , which unfortunately does not exist in Turkey , not only because we could mention the murders of some priests , including Italian ones such as Monsignor Luigi Padovese and Don Andrea Santoro , but also because the Turkish delegates at a recent Council of Europe meeting sadly voted against a motion condemning attacks on Christians around the world .
or is this about removing the irritations about long waiting times for cash payments , about needing to clutter up each car with electronic registration gadgets and about continuously having to pay for bills from different Member States ?
that is curious in itself , because both the Council and the Commission and Parliament have long been in agreement that penal measures are a valid instrument for the enforcement of environmental law . It took several years , however , to establish where responsibility lay for such measures - with the Member States on the basis of framework decisions or with the Community on the basis of a directive .
B4-0769 / 96 by Mr Newens and others , on behalf of the PSE Group , on human rights and the situation in Turkey ; -B4-0797 / 96 by Mr Carnero González and others , on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group , on the human rights situation and prison conditions in Turkey ; -B4-0820 / 96 by Mrs Roth and others , on behalf of the V Group , on human rights violations in Turkey ; -B4-0828 / 96 by Mr Moorhouse and others , on behalf of the PPE Group , on the human rights situation in Turkey ; Chile
in the sphere of communications in particular , we can make a great deal of progress , including the creation of new jobs . At the same time , I should like to reemphasise that the primary concern of every one of us is of course European culture in all its diversity , as is the need to make it visible beyond our national borders and to portray it universally .
what is the point of this and why must such things be stated as a general rule ?
our version of social partnership is in many ways ahead of the social dialogue .
we must indeed implement measures to benefit both employers and employees - or transpose such measures , as the case may be .
we would very much like to find a solution that allows the Erasmus programme for young entrepreneurs to continue .
Mr President , I believe that the political groups are more or less in agreement in delivering a negative verdict on the manner in which the Commission carried out its programme for 1996 .
of course we need to go for an agreement .
in this field , I agree that there is a need for the European Union to offer its full cooperation to these countries in order to overcome the difficulties and delays in the implementation of women &apos;s rights in legislation , to encourage the ratification of international agreements on the protection of human rights and to support the revision and updating of national legislation in this field .
finally and above all , our group stresses that the EU must counterbalance this destabilised high-finance economy with effective social protection , solid public services and guaranteed social rights for workers .
the Finance Ministers will present their &apos; eurokits &apos; and will announce the outcome of their negotiations on cross-border payments .
let me be clear , once again .
my committee is taking more political action on completing the internal market than anything we have seen here today or anything we have heard from the Council .
I have to say again that the political intention of the Treaty was to integrate the existing Schengen Secretariat - without any new appointments being made or any selection procedures being initiated - into the existing General Secretariat because surely there would be no point in the integration of one secretariat with another secretariat meaning that we appointed 80 new staff according to the rules that apply to the General Secretariat and kicked out the 80 people who used to work for the Schengen Secretariat .
we also want a universal service and compliance with public service and environmental obligations ; this will of course be achieved through public calls for tender , so that good service is guaranteed and efficiency is central .
why are illegal immigrants trespassing on various sites used by rail freight transporters ?
I should like to use the situation in Estonia and Latvia as an example of a positive development between two sections of the population which is by no means self-evident .
this is an issue that , for better or for worse , we shall have to live with for a long time to come , for we unfortunately live at a time when it is easier to split an atom than to overturn a prejudice .
if this work is to succeed , it is important that cooperation should be established with the farming organisations and also with consumers .
the development targets achieved in many developing countries are at risk and achievement of the Millennium Development Goals seems ever more difficult .
( FR ) Mr President , today there remains less than 15 % of the original bluefin tuna stock .
I believe that we need to act on both fronts .
another concern , which we do not believe is sufficiently highlighted in this report , concerns the problems of the long-term sustainability of public finances .
we must denounce this selective judicial system which considers adultery a crime , which allows the men to walk free while the women are condemned , even if they are the victims of rape .
we unanimously recognise the need for such rules .
however , this is not just an illusion : it is a renewed commitment to freedom , and not just in the territory of our Union , but particularly in the territory of our friends with whom we have traditionally shared our culture , in Latin America and also in some republics of eastern Europe .
to this day , nevertheless , there is no Statute for European Political Parties ; despite that fact , there is to this day no Statute for Members of the European Parliament .
I was very unhappy to hear that the negotiations with the Council have been unsuccessful so far , but I am absolutely certain that Mrs Wallis will continue to raise the points of both our committee and Parliament .
I would like to ask the Commission what measures it intends to take or has already taken in this respect .
we are making it clear that all the efforts of fiscal consolidation , all the efforts of structural reform , are in fact for growth - for sustainable growth , for inclusive growth - which is the goal of the European Union .
although we have succeeded in providing a certain stability for wine exports to the United States , not least through the easing of procedures , we have at all events gone too far on wine-making practices and we do not yet have sufficient guarantees regarding the misuse of protected names .
all of which gives greater powers to the Member States .
the conclusions of the report accept and include those of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , which is the committee with the competence and expertise on most of the issues raised by the petitioner .
some time ago , 25 000 people died as a result of ground-to-ground missiles in the marshlands of southern Iraq .
you can be assured that the European Union and the Council are working very hard to find the right path in each individual case – and it goes without saying that we care very much about the fates of these people .
Madam President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , what are the issues at stake in this Intergovernmental Conference ?
that is the spirit in which we composed this letter to the President of ECOFIN .
the European employment strategy must contribute to the creation of a dynamic and efficient labour market , in which motivated and well-trained employees are able to undertake high quality and highly productive tasks .
we do not know how to predict the budget for epizootics on this scale , and we shall therefore have to make adjustments as we go along .
this , in turn , can help create new jobs and boost economic growth , thereby increasing the EU &apos;s competitiveness and improving the quality of life of its citizens .
I know that when Trentham was privatized , much of the equipment paid for by the ECSC was actually bricked-up .
above all , Europe must remind these countries that , by signing such agreements , they have committed themselves to respecting minimum standards of fundamental rights .
the IGC ministerial meeting of 8 December 2003 and the bilateral meetings which the Presidency will be stepping up in the coming weeks will therefore have to concentrate , first and foremost , on the institutional issues in order to make the best possible preparation for the final Conference meeting at the level of Heads of State or Government scheduled to open on 12 December 2003 .
this meant that we ultimately chose to support Mr Fava &apos;s report because it sends a clear message to the effect that it is unacceptable for employers to exploit the vulnerable position of migrants with no documents and because it gives certain rights to those migrants with no documents that they currently lack in several of the EU &apos;s Member States .
( applause )
to Mr van den Berg , I would say that , first of all , we would like to pay tribute to the great work that you have been doing on development issues , but also , particularly , as chief observer on difficult missions .
certainly , 2009 will bring significant changes to the European Parliament &apos;s work .
the report , though , shows just as clearly that this programme is marked by a disparity between the wealth of its objectives on the one hand and the astonishing poverty of its budget on the other .
ladies and gentlemen , Mr Martínez , my dear friend , when I am asked this question in Cape Town , I shall give the same answer I am going to give you now .
if property is being rented or sold , we cannot prevent left-wing or right-wing extremists from taking it .
this means that almost ten million tons of waste are created by these cars , and approximately seven per cent of the latter are abandoned out in the open .
with this purpose in mind , it would be worth considering earmarking resources at EU level , aimed specifically at bringing LAU 1 ( formerly NUTS 4 ) planning-statistical regions into line where the decision about the use of these resources can be made by the relevant small regions or their associations .
it is particularly important for our new Member States , which have been denied the advantage of free movement of people , goods and services for so long .
we have had a lot of difficulties with this report , on the whole question of how much money we should go for and over what period of time , and what the role of the taskforces should be .
if we make a success of enlargement , we will also meet their expectations .
investment in Ukraine seems to be of special importance for us .
without those , I would submit that we are not able to judge whether or not the tunnel is safe .
that is why I propose to my Group that we should not vote against , as we originally intended , but should abstain and that in future we should look at cases of this kind in more detail in this House .
Mr President , I would like to say a big thank you to everyone involved .
.
the survival of the human race is being seriously threatened and we must find a common solution to the problem .
this will avoid majority decisions being taken in the ECB Governing Council without taking sufficient account of the economic realities in the European Union .
this programme is arriving at a time of economic uncertainty and high unemployment , the reduction of which is an immediate priority .
the very reason that we are here today is to create a legal framework in order to harmonise the sale of these food supplements .
( MT ) Madam President , I agree with those who say that the Common European Market , the single market , is probably the largest project the European Union has ever undertaken .
this has to be done now , and for that clarity is needed .
but the account we are paying in to is generally geared to one Member State .
I refer on the one hand to the need to improve the Commission &apos;s efficiency in achieving its priority tasks and on the other hand the ambition to create some sort of EU diplomatic service .
there has been no lack of discussion of two of them , twin threats that we face : global warming and declining reserves of fossil fuels .
this has also been studied and , in fact , in the cases we have authorised , these risks are absolutely minimal or quite simply non-existent .
we still have to analyse and express a position on a number of points .
if we wish to gain the trust of the citizen , however , I believe that , above all , it is essential to make Europe credible and to make our policies credible .
how far do you intervene politically in issues of media concentration in areas that , as the Commissioner pointed out very clearly , cut across a whole range of other weapons the Commission has at its disposal to regulate monopoly power , a word that has been freely bandied around this Chamber this evening ?
the convention , as you will be aware , also covers the prevention of accidents which have radiological effects and the limitation of such effects when incidents of this kind occur .
nevertheless , the testing instrument will be available for all the countries that want to make sure that the tests , other than those for these five foreign languages , can be included as national options .
it has been a pleasure working on this report .
if the Council adopts this proposal , cattle farming in Europe will not be squeezed out of the market and animal welfare will enjoy a structural improvement .
I support her demand that in future there must be clauses to stop EU aid when women ’ s right are continually and systematically violated .
by 2006 the EU will need 36,000 sailors .
I would like to underline again that the position taken by the Heads of State and Government with regard to the Commission &apos;s proposal on charges for trans-frontier money transfers is surely a step in the right direction .
increased openness , greater effectiveness and better democratic and judicial control are necessary in order that people should know that this affects them .
promotion campaigns and advertising for goods and services must be paid for by the producers , not by hard-pressed taxpayers .
firstly , the modernisation of our economy is now underway , secondly , we have a Social Agenda aimed at rejigging the European Social Model while preserving its character , and thirdly , we are making every endeavour to achieve sustainable development which will include the environmental dimension .
before the vote I pointed out that I insisted that there should be a vote on the second part , which does not include Mr Crowley &apos;s amendment .
- It is not third countries that are responsible for the closure of businesses and the loss of jobs ; it is the EU , which is at the head of the queue to promote competition and liberalisation of international trade and which maintains the euro at a level that harms manufacturing and exporting , as in the case of footwear .
I think it is highly questionable for the Commission to declare , in a political agreement , if the common position gets through , that we should withdraw our complaint against Austria regarding excessive toll charges as a matter of political agreement .
I think now is the time to move and to help people ensure that they can make a contribution to the development of anaerobic digesters and so on , and , as other speakers have said , to the development of job creation for the new economy .
these issues should be at the heart of the political agenda .
otherwise , international trade is liable to be shaken by events such as the current issue of Russian import barriers on agricultural products from Poland .
moreover , the regulation resolves the problem of the ambiguous legal basis of the handbook by creating a proper legal instrument containing all the basic principles and rules relating to borders .
I would like to thank the rapporteur for supporting my amendments and for his excellent oral contribution .
we , the Members of the European Parliament belonging to the Austrian People ’ s Party , are in favour of gender equality and also of politics playing an active role in this area .
I am talking about companies of less than 50 people .
we could simply have one major seat , cut the travelling circus , introduce vivid debates , vote on major issues and change the D &apos;Hondt system into a fairer system to avoid discrimination against smaller delegations in the big groups , against the smaller groups and against the independents .
the European Union is very often criticised for excessive regulation , for passing far too many laws that burden the economic environment .
5 . With the Constitutional Treaty for the EU , the EU ’ s foreign policy would be bound only by the principles of the UN Charter rather than by the Charter as a whole ( I-3,4 ) .
oil is controlled by the United States of America : in one way in Iraq , in another way in Saudi Arabia , in another way in Libya and in another way in Venezuela .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we will be endorsing Mr Deva &apos;s report and we also want to congratulate him .
that concludes the vote .
the wine sector provides work for around 300 000 people ( a quarter of the active population of the country ) who mostly live in rural areas , cultivating small or medium-sized family plots .
the European Union should mobilise pre-accession funds through aid across a wide front so as to promote the reform process in those countries .
extending a hand to the Cuban Government to enter into a long-term partnership with the European Union only makes sense if , at the same time , the European Union does all it can to maintain and step up its dialogue with those involved in Cuban civil society , including human rights defenders and peaceful political activists .
I believe that today we not only need to congratulate the rapporteur on her report but that we can also congratulate ourselves as a Parliament for our dogged , lengthy and ultimately successful efforts to achieve a number of improvements to the original Council proposal and hence to the common position too .
however , we will take into account Parliament &apos;s remarks in a new recital .
the European Commission will be owner and the European Space Agency will be manager .
the dominant forces of European capitalist integration are fully aware of this increasing contradiction .
however , they will be run based on an undemocratic framework .
would it not , then , be much more sensible to concentrate on solving these existing problems together via dialogue , in an effort to give all the minorities of this region a better chance ?
we in the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats are going to be active in defending those interests and in eradicating &apos; rubbish boats &apos; .
( ES ) Mr President , women have always done the unseen work : doing the housework and providing emotional support ; things that you cannot buy and for which you cannot hire somebody in .
the process of relocation is in reality fundamentally unilateral .
turning to the subject of climate and energy , quite frankly I was shocked when a German Government representative declared in Brussels , just a few days before this spring summit , that environment policy ought to steer clear of industrial and economic policy .
( PL ) Mr President , I should like to begin by thanking Mrs Wallis for all the work she has put into this European Parliament draft resolution .
at a pivotal moment in the life of the European institutions , when the European Central Bank , in particular , is required to perform an especially careful and interventionist role in monitoring the sovereign debt crisis , the stability of the euro and economic recovery , I wish the newly appointed Mr Praet every success in his office , and I believe that he will perform the functions for which he has been appointed with dedication and competence .
that is their only chance now .
after thirteen months in actual physical existence , the euro has become the equal of the dollar , and is already the second reserve currency in the world .
Mr Elchlepp has a question for the Commission .
addiction , medical problems , social misery , abuse , all these things are well known .
for me , I will have the pleasure , as a Vice-President of this House , of participating in the conference that you are organising on Friday .
here too , education and training measures need to be supported in order , in the end , to help people to help themselves .
it ought to be possible to combine economic reform and competition policy with strong and sound social justice and social progress principles .
it should be noted that recent years have seen a convergence of Parliament and the Commission in this sector .
especially in a society where the application will be carried out by private companies whose objective is profit .
it is a very far-reaching proposal as it bans the sale of these substances and all their possible mixtures to the general public .
we want to use the directive to ensure that the Member States report frequently on implementation of the law , in particular during the progressive application of targets to reduce the amount of biodegradable waste going to landfill .
I am in a very difficult position , since this dance has started and I am not being fair in the eyes of the other groups .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( NL ) Mr President , first of all I should like to thank the rapporteur for what was generally a balanced piece of work .
Mr President , it gives me the most enormous pleasure to be able , on behalf of the Socialist Group , to pay tribute to our colleague and our comrade , John Hume , who , as you know , is now a Nobel Peace laureate .
I would also welcome further cooperation on matters relating to cyber security .
this is extremely regrettable and remarkable , considering that the EU &apos; s responsibility after Kyoto is to reduce CO2 emissions by a total of 8 % .
such a quota system does not represent any encroachment upon freedom of expression .
I welcome the Commission statement , but I should just like to identify a number of specific points that are very important to us .
moreover , the American method proves ineffective because terrorism appears to be a seven-headed monster .
Barthet-Mayer was telling you you have to follow a different line - labels , national traceability , knowing where the products come from - in a word , you would have to question your own policy .
– Mr President , I wish to congratulate Mr Tannock on his report on the new European neighbourhood policy , which is set to be one of the EU ’ s most strategically important instruments , not least from the point of view of global security , as Mrs Ferrero-Waldner , to whom I also wish to pay tribute , pointed out .
the abolition of the rules of origin would open the EU market to another 30 developing countries , including competitive India , while countries affected by the tsunami , for example Sri Lanka , would be unable to compete realistically .
I will conclude by saying that there is another phenomenon to face : the serious problem of violence against women .
there is not enough money .
it is a formidable problem , not just in this connection , as well we know .
after studying the Commission &apos;s communication I am still just as much in the dark as before about how each part of a programme is co-ordinated and by whom .
I personally learned about it through the media , and without commenting specifically on that visit I think it is very important to create sufficient political support to put an end to land mines as an instrument of terror .
I think the only way we can have an immigration policy commensurate with the problem and also compatible with our values is to define a policy constructed on three pillars .
Mr Rübig , I can inform you that the necessary steps have been taken and the President of the European Parliament will be in constant contact with the Belgian authorities about this serious problem . The College of Quaestors , which meets tomorrow afternoon , has added this matter to its agenda .
I am also much obliged to the British Presidency .
secondly , I am not convinced that a total ban would mean that poaching would cease .
however , these require appropriate monitoring by national governments , which should make fisheries a strategic priority in order to ensure the economic and social viability of coastal communities .
Madam President , I think we are all entitled to congratulate ourselves on this joint debate between the Commission , Parliament and the Council .
however , we cannot keep selective memories alive .
we have made clear once again that the Albanian population need to see the real opportunity for promoting their interests through political means .
our group has never gone against the country or against Austria .
I would like to say briefly , now that another accident has occurred in the St Gotthard tunnel , that I think there is a difference between learning lessons from that accident and exploiting its emotional charge for political ends .
I am not satisfied so far that what is being proposed is , in fact , going to address those concerns .
the Committee on Petitions plays a major role in implementation of Parliament &apos;s supervisory powers .
no new criteria were set up ; instead , the European Council reaffirmed that it will honour its existing commitments .
I began by doing my best to convince the Commission to abandon its original distinction between international and national and we then managed to persuade the Council to do likewise .
it is a pertinent question .
( Parliament rejected the request )
therefore a rollover period for the current regulation is expected in order to maintain the benefits of international trade enjoyed by developing countries , starting with the poorest , when accessing the European market .
– Madam President , Commissioner , thank you for the reply , although I note that you couched it in much more general terms in replying to the European Parliament than in the preliminary conclusion released on 12 April .
I believe it would be quite excellent if the new Ombudsman could investigate the relations between the auditing and supervisory bodies and see whether they fulfil the requirements of good administration and adequate transparency .
why , given our efficiency in this technology , do we have to buy in from &apos; outside &apos; ?
we are reserving judgement on one point , point 12 . There is mention here of a &apos; definitive &apos; system for , amongst other things , value added tax .
in order to develop , however , it is necessary to have economic growth , and hence competitiveness , and developing countries will lose this competitive battle if the digital divide with the rich countries is widening rather than narrowing .
admittedly , the Council has not really striven for harmonisation but , rather , put together a framework with a number of ingenious loopholes .
of course , this is only the start ; we are not ready yet and first reading will take place in the autumn .
( FR ) Mr President , here you are invested for six months in the rotating and brief role of President of the European Union .
it is also a fact that the accession of Central and Eastern European countries would end the division of Europe and change the face of the Union altogether .
nevertheless , any religious or ideological fundamentalism is poison for democracy .
here and now .
every Member State should have a highly effective pandemic plan .
thank you very much , Mrs Bonino .
amongst the problems which women are unfortunately facing at the moment , we must mention the violence directed at them : domestic violence , armed conflict and trafficking in women , which has been increasing in recent years .
I have other engagements so I cannot stay .
the Florence summit was intended , as the Italian presidency comes to an end , to sum up the progress that has been made over the last six months , to open up prospects for the future and to introduce the next presidency .
disaster relief must be set in motion extremely quickly .
three hundred of us crossed the Kalandia checkpoint to go to meet Yasser Arafat .
registration tax when abused by government raises the price of cars exorbitantly .
finally , I do not need to repeat what Mr Wijsenbeek has said already about the euro .
where there are concerns about dominance , it is appropriate for a competition authority to look closely at the causes of that dominance .
that means the triumph of the back-room politics of the big countries , and this will have a paralysing effect .
thank you very much , Commissioner .
we must wait to see what the estimates are and after next week we will be in a position to talk about what exactly it is that agriculture needs .
I therefore wonder whether it might not be a good idea to refrain from scheduling any more votes for Friday in the future .
if it does not , the UK Conservative delegation would agree with Mr Hökmark , as well as many other colleagues , and reluctantly vote to reject this report as it stands .
they are a threat to democracy and they do not reflect the views of the majority of Polish people .
fortunately , this time it was possible to avert a tragedy .
I do not see what reason there is to congratulate him as many of his original paragraphs have been dropped , particularly because of his own Group which , in its wisdom , decided to table a great many amendments to delete sections , and these were adopted .
the second lesson concerns the barbarity of fascism , and , as we have just heard , one of its symbols is Guernica : the symbol of murder , assassination , incarceration ; the symbol too of an international Fascist project , since it is clear that Spanish Fascism would never have been able to triumph without the help of National Socialism .
Mr President , I refer to Friday &apos;s Minutes , where you wrote in a letter to me : &apos; rest assured that I share your concern and shall do my utmost with the Belgian authorities to find a satisfactory solution where the safety of the Members and staff of the European Parliament is concerned . &apos;
our vote today will contribute greatly to a better , more democratic and a much more transparent European Union .
I would like to take a quick look at the reports we are debating , in order to give some answers to the questions asked by the rapporteurs .
it is no longer possible for this dossier to be placed in the hands of presidencies which , as we know , change over every six months ; we need a permanent spokesman who can , on his own authority , organise the work of the various Member State delegations in New York so that , next year , we have a position which is consistent from beginning to end , thus avoiding this truly tragic situation , one that has made things difficult for a number of third countries friendly to the European Union , starting with Mexico , which had made a very firm commitment to defending our perfectly acceptable compromise position .
it is a question of a qualitative , and not a numerical , value .
this is certainly solid ground that we should occupy , but , I repeat , we must find a balance .
the EU should not be turned into one large biological exploratorium , as is happening now .
upon which safeguards are we insisting ?
in those circumstances , consideration should be given to what is likely to produce the best result .
addressing this imbalance is one of the tasks we must take on together in carrying these issues forward .
we want to send a message to Serbia through a Stabilisation and Association Agreement and by reducing visa restrictions - provided Serbia cooperates with the ICTY - to say that the country is welcome in the European Union , and we want to see an end to this constant self-flagellation and inferiority complex .
fortunately , he has recovered quickly and we are thankful for that .
also , in boycotting the Beijing Olympics , we deprive the Chinese authorities of their triumph .
in 2005 , the new multi-annual justice and home affairs programme will be launched – which we hope will be supported by the European Council of 5 November – as well as new support measures within the context of the next financial perspectives .
the Committee on the Environment specifically proposes the following . In order to prevent evasion of the provisions of the Waste Shipments Regulation , guidelines must be introduced that make it possible to distinguish between when a ship is truly a ship and when it is waste .
finally , the issue of the programme for women .
most Member States already have their own anti-discrimination measures designed to suit their own culture and their own circumstances .
the pastoral care of these people is being frustrated by recent expulsions of five Catholic priests .
this mini court where everything and nothing is discussed is quite important but also interesting , and different from what we do .
this is why the proposal to authorize the addition of vegetable fats other than cocoa butter to chocolate is unacceptable , because it undermines the integrity of the product .
what Mrs Kokkola &apos;s report is calling for is genuine incorporation of the principle of equality into all the Union &apos;s policies and strategies .
we underlined our serious concerns about freedom of the press and freedom of speech and we pressed the Russians to clarify the circumstances of Mr Babitsky &apos; s detention in view of their obligations in the field of human rights .
I believe the Commission has made the right choice of areas in which partnerships should be established with the countries which are in these associations with us .
as a German MEP - I hope you are listening , Mr Langen - I am ashamed of my national government .
&apos; paper fish &apos; were removed , real fish quotas and licence fees were introduced and provisions for an annual scientific review of the quotas were incorporated .
I am very unnerved by the fact that the military commander of the Libyan rebels has been identified as a long-serving CIA agent .
the Health Check will now confirm the validity of this twofold objective .
the new Constitutional Treaty provided for the creation of the European research area .
what was really needed , though , was a policy to support production , particularly in the textile sector , to prevent further company closures and further redundancies .
however , I do not dismiss this aid just like that , for there are also situations where small enterprises can offer sound , fresh opportunities to groups of workers , notably to migrants and pioneers in the field of technical innovation .
he went on to give us the correct answer .
our position on this issue is that the Commission ’ s hand must be strengthened , and it must continue to be a player .
in demonstrations the starving , from Africa to the Middle East , and from south-east Asia to Latin America , chant one and the same slogan : &apos; we are hungry ! &apos;
as long as ten years ago , it was extremely clear how serious this epidemic could become in certain developing countries , but too little was done both in those countries and by the international community .
I approved of this report because the 2006 report of the European Court of Auditors showed that the control systems in place for the cohesion policy were not effective enough , and the error rate in the expenditure reimbursed was too great ( 12 % ) .
that is why Parliament , Commission and Council agreed to those targets .
the issues which can be brought before the Court are human rights matters , and everything else should be excluded .
ladies and gentlemen , such a squandering of public resources shows nothing more than contempt for the realities of the situation .
how are the severe restrictions on movements of animals being enforced , Commissioner ?
it seems that the EU is now faced with a dilemma .
it is important that Member States do implement this action plan .
it is now time to switch to taking action and to implement the proposals as quickly as possible .
the aim of any regulation or decision regarding competition is to benefit the consumer .
because we need only look at the text of the agreement to see what the priorities are : first and foremost , increasing the production of and trade in goods and services .
perhaps then the tragedy last week in Wexford of the Turkish , Algerian and Albanian economic migrants will not have not been in vain .
our economies could no longer function without migrant workers , and without their social security contributions our welfare system would be paralysed , threatened as it is by the plummeting birth rate .
secondly , every effort must be made to avoid extending the interim period , which will be triggered at the end of President Préval &apos;s term of office on 7 February .
( applause )
it is clear that , under the Treaty of Nice , Spain and Poland have too great a voice in the EU , but the EU budget should not be used for political pressure in respect of these countries .
we recognise that this cannot be expected immediately and must therefore agree with the amendment approved in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy in favour of a 15 % rather than a 20 % minimum rate , to less the impact of any harmful competition .
thank you very much , Commissioner .
however , increased productivity requires not only the implementation of technological advances , but also the relocation of production from locations where it is more expensive to those where it is cheaper .
despite lending my support to all the requests to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund presented by the Netherlands concerning the severe wave of redundancies which has plagued two areas of the graphics sector - printing and reproduction of recorded media and publishing - I believe that the Dutch authorities could provide more details about the scope of the measures and their accuracy , so as to allow these measures to be assessed more effectively .
however , this issue was discussed at the last two Industry Councils and on both occasions the Commission explained the measures that have been taken to reduce the incentives that Member States can offer to companies to make them move from one area to another .
surely , the whole object of this exercise is simplification and clarification .
regarding the economic situation , I think it is too soon to make an overall assessment of the damage caused , and it is probably better to avoid very dramatic - or let us say , panic - scenarios .
therefore , we have the experience which makes it clear that we must return to the effective representation of community interests .
Commissioner , in that lengthy answer , I am not sure I heard you once mention the words &apos; rural &apos; , &apos; agriculture &apos; or &apos; the need for investment &apos; , because the problem with slums is that 900 million people are rushing to them for a better life , because there is nothing better in the rural areas .
however , we must also consider the fact that Libya is an important transit country for illegal mass immigration from Africa to Europe .
at its Congress in Toulouse last year , the Group of the European People &apos;s Party demanded that future cooperation should no longer be based so much on colonial links , but on income per head and its distribution , and above all on the willingness of those in government to contribute genuinely to the development of people in their country .
three things are worth mentioning when we look at the figures within that budget .
you said that you support the idea of criteria being put in place for services of general interest , so that countries will be able to regulate their own public housing , health care or other areas more .
competition policy is principally concerned with the interests of consumers , and tries to ensure them easy access to goods and services offered on the single market at prices which are as close as possible throughout the Union .
proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation ( EC ) No 2201 / 96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the markets in processed fruit and vegetable products
coming from a new Member State and as a former journalist , I totally agree with the importance of the Aarhus Convention .
the next step involves removing the administrative obstacles to renewable energy .
the British Government does not have a leg to stand on .
Unilever offered all of those leaving a comprehensive support programme for finding new employment , and the firm cooperated closely with the local employment office in managing the programme .
resumption of the session
Mr President , I am speaking instead of the rapporteur tonight . Sadly , he cannot be with us .
I should nonetheless like , however , to highlight two points : first of all , the failure - already mentioned many times today - to implement the budget for the structural funds .
the answer remains in the air .
it can standardise the rules on air safety and environmental protection , and
so , I would now - once again - like to ask the Commission : What has happened with regard to the disaster preparedness for our seas ?
whilst I can , of course , imagine that this is hard news for producers of barometers to take , if we want to banish mercury altogether , we must in any event ban consumer products that contain it .
I congratulate the Commission on its initiative and call for greater cooperation with Parliament on such an important matter for the future of Europe .
it is not an urgent matter to come up with another new law , another legislative package .
a formidable sword of Damocles thus hangs above our cultural policies .
programmes such as &apos; Youth in Action &apos; and &apos; Lifelong Learning &apos; , which have a very low cost per beneficiary and are extremely effective , should therefore be maintained as a separate element of future multiannual financial frameworks , and these programmes also deserve significantly more funding .
the economic situation is improving ; growth prospects are good and , more generally , the economic outlook remains positive .
that is why we agree with the proposal to suggest to forthcoming Council presidencies that they make the topic of ICTs and their importance in combating and adapting to climate change one of their priorities .
only Mr Di Lello could be so superficial and irresponsible as to cast such hasty aspersions on the Italian government .
we could perhaps require ships flying the flags of Member States to be broken exclusively in fully authorised and certified facilities .
this should help them in individual sorting .
for example , the fact that separate collection is mandatory as long as it is the best option from both the environmental and economic standpoints .
the Constitution would introduce double majority voting , with the result that we should be voting on the basis of population figures .
I am therefore very grateful to my colleague , Albert Dess , for helping me on Monday to keep this important item on the agenda - because , ladies and gentlemen , we need to make Iran one of our priorities in the context of Parliament &apos;s work to support human rights !
my biggest worry is that there has not been a proper impact assessment by the Commission and there is no clear indication of what this report will mean for agriculture .
financial reports of any enterprises , including trusts and charities , should be subject to similar rules right across the Community , and there should be mutual recognition of the qualifications of those empowered to sign audit reports .
Mr President , &quot; Europe stands for ideals , values and principles .
my second comment relates to energy .
we may well be able to go further by 2010 , but this is something that can only be decided when we know how Member States will meet their Kyoto targets .
personally , I feel that labelling will not suffice or , if labelling is used , this type of blended wine must not be called &apos; rosé &apos; .
however , after submitting the form , victims receive a letter demanding payment of EUR 1 000 per year for three consecutive years .
Mr President , the key point that Mr Andersson made in his contribution tonight is the need to get the social and financial concerns in balance .
I would like to stress that the Commission agrees to a large extent with the principles and the bases of the report by Mr Stockmann , and also with the measures he proposes .
the debate is closed .
they can all see that if the IGC discards the outcome of the Convention , then it will fall to them to come up with alternative solutions commanding a greater consensus .
the Presidency has raised the question of the need to coordinate the Union &apos;s policies on illegal immigrants with asylum policy and the need for an integrated policy .
please tell your groups to allocate sufficient time to their speakers .
as a parliamentarian , I am rather disappointed that the delegation managed to fit in 75 journalists but could not manage any parliamentarians on the grounds that the delegation was a small one .
there is no mention of elements which could underpin a European economic recovery , such as making investments in the key areas of infrastructure , education , research and innovation .
in Italy , there are sectors that represent real strengths , such as beach concessions , in which the owners have invested all their possessions and made enormous sacrifices .
the latest Eurobarometer poll shows that only 52 % of EU citizens consider membership to be a good thing for their country .
with clearsightedness , patience and courage , you , Mr Hume , have managed to stay on course and achieve the goal .
in this sense , it is very important that this notion of Eastern Partnership is not perceived either by us or our eastern neighbours as an attempt to replace future membership for good by such an initiative .
I simply must say this !
all these large-scale trends can be influenced positively by increasing the combined production of heat and power .
I will see to it that this is done .
secondly , even though today the average figures are still around 7-8 % of GDP , we have countries where tourism accounts for up to 12 % of GDP , which shows its importance .
our own recently created institutions such as the European Research Council are also failing to meet any equality criteria .
furthermore , we are calling on governments to pursue exchange-rate stability , on the basis of sound monetary and fiscal policies , and to maintain low interest and inflation rates and levels of public deficit .
by failing to link the issue of congestion with air traffic reduction the report misses out on a vital strategy .
Mr President , I should like to begin by congratulating the Commission on its proposal , which I feel is a successful attempt to combat the pollution that is still being caused by vessels dumping their waste at sea .
intermodal transport systems , which form a basic model for future transport , should therefore take account of the positive role that inland waterway navigation can and must play .
however , drawing a line under the matter does not mean just filing it away .
indeed , I wish they had been outspoken at all ...
at second reading we have an unusually large number of amendments that were tabled and will be voted on tomorrow .
- Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for taking on my suggestion , encouraging computer software manufacturers to take additional measures blocking access to pornographic and violent websites .
I hope that the administrative services will focus at least the same attention on this aspect as they have given to the Statute for Members .
although I am glad that we have found a way to accommodate the railways to some extent , a degree of harshness is still apparent , so there are two or three amendments with which I am not quite so happy .
the second focal point is - yes , you said it - the infrastructure connecting countries and within countries , and smart grids .
if we are honest , the euro divides the European Union from the United States , as the euro is the dollar &apos;s main rival .
these men have legitimate concerns and we should share those concerns on environmental grounds .
reference has been made to the events in Genoa : thousands of people had been recorded in SIS after the incidents in Gothenburg , but this was of no benefit to the Italian police .
the threshold values for the colours are arbitrary and the breadth of each colour category is too great .
the main lesson to learn from BSE and other recent food scares surely is that we must favour a return to natural methods of food production and feeding of livestock .
not content with abandoning its commitments to Cockerill - developing technological innovation , renewing tools , promoting employment - Arcelor is making threats .
I support the measures adopted by the European Union in a situation where the transition to a democratic system is being jeopardised indefinitely by the illegal and , by extension , unconstitutional way in which Rajoelina took power .
in addition , we have heard about 240 election observers under Mrs De Keyser ’ s great leadership .
this should be based on the solidarity clause contained in Article 80 of the TFEU .
we also share the view that the procedure for dealing with these policy strategies as they go through the committees and then through the budget process will be very important in order for us to be able to see that they are properly brought together .
worst of all is the loss of animal fodder , mainly as the result of the grain lost .
on behalf of women in the Member States , I also regret the neo-liberal economic policy , with its deregulation and privatisation , which makes women ’ s situation still more difficult where both job opportunities and access to childcare and care of the elderly are concerned .
I noted , in particular , that you agree with me that in the case of agriculture we should wait for the letter of amendment .
we are resolute in our position : we are calling on the Russian Government to establish a transparent and non-discriminatory system and gradually to reduce the charges before they stop altogether in 2013 , which was the date agreed in 2004 between the Russian Government and the Commission .
it is obvious that in some over-regulated sectors we need fewer , better and more efficient regulations , but the opposite is true of other areas , where we must be able to rectify any critical deficiencies and create certain legal frameworks .
it will provide an important signal to our partners , in particular developing countries and economies in transition , including Russia , of our continuing support for the Kyoto Protocol and our firm intention to tackle climate change multilaterally .
and in this regard , the rapporteur partially approached the matter very aptly , in that she attempted to integrate the 2020 policy within the bounds of the budget .
despite the verbal outpourings in Sharm el-Sheikh and Jerusalem , nothing has yet been done in this respect .
in freezing , even reducing , structural funds - such as Objectives 2 and 5b intended for supporting industrial redevelopments and rural development - our governments are calling into question the huge effort the Union has made in favour of its Southern regions - and my region too is benefiting - for balanced development of European territory .
the economic and humanitarian situation in the Palestinian territories is intolerable .
but I know that the basic problem with this reactor is that it is situated in a fault area where earthquakes and the like can occur , and this is something which it is difficult for the TACIS programme to deal with .
there are tremendous possibilities there .
yesterday and on Monday I made an official visit to Berlin and to the Bundestag on behalf of this Parliament .
they also fear the social , ethnic and political tensions which may result , particularly in central Africa , in the short or long term .
the regional integration which is part of the EPA process will help ACP countries to prosper , to increase South-South trade and the removal of tariff barriers between neighbouring ACP countries .
furthermore , it believes that it is necessary to privatise the water industry .
quantity instead of quality ?
the overheating of the Irish economy has no influence whatsoever at a European level , so there is no need for action at the level of the European Central Bank .
I welcome your suggestion , Mrs Oomen-Ruijten , that we should be given an overview of which Member States are blocking progress so much .
thanks are due also to the coordinators and political advisers who oversaw the work , and to the eight parliamentary committees involved for their opinions .
the next item is an oral question ( B5-0001 / 2002 ) put by Mr Karas , Mr Radwan and Mrs Villiers to the Commission on behalf of the Group of the European People &apos; s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats on Basle II - own funds for credit institutions .
one must genuinely create Europe &apos; .
health and safety in the workplace can only be maintained where adequate monitoring is conducted at workplace level .
the draft text of your amending Treaty is not without its faults : the loss of Europe &apos;s symbols is a blow to federalists , as is the fudge on voting systems wrought by the Poles .
the economic and financial crisis has had a much harsher effect on the transforming countries of Central and Eastern Europe than on the stable democracies of Western Europe .
the rapporteur has expressed clear views .
our proposals fulfil all these aims and conditions .
the debate is closed .
that must be our commitment , and I believe that with Mr Turmes and his group we shall succeed in doing a lot more work yet .
although I lamented this label and these ambitions , I also acknowledged that such a treaty was necessary .
I think this is an investment opportunity for businesses to develop new services that can rekindle demand and also help to improve our citizens &apos; public services .
unfortunately , the Council failed once again this year to follow the good example of Parliament , and discharge for 1998 has been granted as if the matter were quite insignificant .
regional tensions are now threatening to increase , the nation is frustrated by unemployment , and corruption and crime have taken hold .
this is the question - both parliamentary and political - but for a different reason , to the President of the Socialist Group .
we need a space , a European space , in which political parties would unite the EU &apos;s citizens and help them in their everyday lives .
Mr President , I would at least like to compliment the Commissioner on providing such a clear commentary .
Mr President , we need to speak our minds on this subject in the European Parliament , during the plenary sittings and in the committees , even if it is obvious that the debate must take into account the world of the culture , the legal culture and the places where institutional issues are addressed .
the reason for this is that not all our fellow Members were able , physically , to get here , and we cannot deprive them of the right to participate in this part-session .
there will be no consent to this move .
one might go so far as to imagine , even if this is a matter for subsidiarity , that the Community as such should at least define the minimum standards of what the universal service may be . Otherwise we are heading towards a relatively chaotic situation .
Europe costs , and if we look at the structure of expenditure on the European budget in the structure of expenditure of the biggest contributors , we see that spending on Europe is not a major cost .
if paragraph 22 of the motion for a resolution is rejected , we can fully endorse the report as a very relevant critique of the communication from the Commission and a practical indication of how the future framework directive should be drawn up .
it is simply not on .
that is why I voted in favour of this report .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , first and foremost I should like to congratulate the Irish presidency .
we have long hoped that , even with a Communist regime , this country would stick to economic development and the road towards the European Union .
all the same , I wish you every success if you are elected .
but I cannot help pointing out that the Green Group in the European Parliament tabled the selfsame motion before the summer recess , and those very Members who have now tabled the motion refused to discuss it at that time in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection .
as a democrat I am particularly struck by two amendments relating to the Corbett report , for I do not think these could have been meant seriously .
public involvement in cooperation with developing countries is at the heart of our concerns .
as far as possible , we are also providing or trying to provide solutions to any humanitarian crises and public order crises such as those which are currently unfortunately occurring in Kosovo and the Balkans .
we are talking about fundamental and universal human rights .
. – I wish to reiterate the comments already made at first reading , regretting that this draft budget for the financial year 2005 should , overall , total only 1.004 % of the Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) of the 25 European Union Member States .
has the Commission drawn up a proposal along these lines ?
the Harrison report goes on to make other recommendations which need to be absorbed .
the European Union must set an example in the face of this tragedy .
but the Union should start in one area of glaring inconsistency which requires little more than ministerial fiat to fix .
in this respect , I would like to remind you that , despite the constant increase in the number of donations and transplantations in recent years , it is estimated that currently there are 56 000 patients in the European Union on the waiting list for the right organ , and many of them die before receiving it .
honourable Members know that one of the criticisms which can be made about us is that sometimes we take a long time to respond .
the next item is the vote .
among the main reasons cited for voting ‘ no ’ are that , and I quote : ‘ economically speaking the draft is seen as too liberal ’ and ‘ the lack of social Europe ’ .
this update was necessitated by the events of September 2001 and our desire to make our own contribution to the work undertaken by our colleagues in the Convention .
I am especially pleased that this has been made possible for me on the 50th anniversary of Robert Schuman &apos; s appeal to France , Germany and other countries to enter into a common economic policy on steel and coal .
I followed it very closely and there are many things which we will certainly take into consideration when developing our future work .
is it the case that the Council still attaches importance to the democratic interplay between the three institutions and that closer cooperation will not inevitably mean greater decision making by one institution , by the Council , to the detriment of Parliament and Commission and , by implication , the people of Europe ?
the Commission should in my opinion be able to take legal actions in a criminal case and to give evidence in courts on the same basis as the national authorities .
these instruments properly define GDP and there is nothing to add to the Stability and Growth Pact on that score .
in order to do so , we need - inter alia - a consistently low interest rate , efficient transport and data communications , a skilled work-force , investment in research and product development and a sustainable energy policy .
he was the only one to take the trouble to introduce himself to the non-attached Members of the European Parliament and to answer their questions .
the European Union , a staunch defender of the United Nations &apos; role in resolving global issues , will also have work to do in other areas , both bilateral and multilateral , formal and informal , helping everyone to correctly identify opportunities , listening to our partners , and working on consolidating sectoral responses that are consistent with what is needed to fight climate change .
today they virtually boil down to the fact that the European Union holds consultations with Russia on this subject once every six months .
however , at the present time , I do not wish to agree to Amendments Nos 11 , 13 and 32 .
establishing the reasons why this has been impossible to date will also lead to the answer as to what has gone wrong at our end .
the focus in the fund on young fishers will also help in the field of equal opportunities .
this report underlines the urgent need for a Community initiative to effectively combat violence against women .
the abolition of duty-free sales , from 1 July 1999 , would have serious economic and social consequences .
those are practical measures which can assist employment growth and retention .
Mr President , Commissioner , the House has already held several debates on the cruel way in which the law is implemented in Iran .
( NL ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I have one minute to applaud the Belgian Presidency .
Mr President , the European Union Member States agreed last summer that ships in distress should immediately be accommodated in a place of refuge .
because if we simply go hammering on about infrastructure and not about the right way of using it , do not ensure the user-friendliness of teaching material in the educational environment and do not actually make it available and keep it up to date day by day , then it will all come to nothing .
of course it would help enormously if you , ladies and gentlemen , would also put pressure on as many people as you can in the course of your contacts with National Governments and Parliaments .
thirdly , the enlargement of the European Union and , fourthly , a peaceful , democratic and social development of all regions in the world .
the European Union should make it policy to promote the abolition of these immoral practices .
and why do we do that ?
even a homosexual partnership , for instance , is seen here as equivalent to a family relationship .
in this respect I believe that the Council &apos;s common position is a good one .
Madam President , I thank Mr Deva for his contribution but can I ask him , when he says that the euro handouts are over , if he does not agree that all Member States , including the United Kingdom , should stick to the calendar for achieving the UN Millennium Development Goal of committing 0.7 % of GNP to development aid by the year 2013 ?
you know that yourself , as you recently visited Northern Ireland .
a European system for monitoring the market and recording changes in prices of agricultural product and inputs , which could be combined with a similar international system under the auspices of the FAO .
Parliament &apos;s amendments are crucial in order to guarantee EU citizens legal certainty .
however , the European leaders at that time demonstrated courage and farsightedness even when Bulgaria and Romania were not members of the European Union .
furthermore , in accordance with the debate &apos; s agenda , the normal course of action would be for the joint debate on the four reports to take place and then for the Commission &apos; s statement to be made and a further debate on this to take place .
Mr President , High Representative , we are being haunted by the chronicle of long-expected and mindless acts of violence in the Middle East .
the European Court of Auditors is responsible because it must reflect on its audit methods , and in particular on the materiality levels ; it is the responsibility of the Court , not of the Commission or Parliament , to lay down the materiality thresholds .
personally , I am convinced that some Member States will not have to finance the universal service from public or additional funds .
the idea is that , each autumn with effect from 2006 , Member States should submit a single report on the implementation of their national action programme .
the resolution contains another appeal to the Cambodian authorities that also meets with my complete approval .
it is regrettable that EUR 200 million per annum of the taxpayer &apos;s money continues to be spent on holding 12 sessions in Strasbourg every year .
HIV , tuberculosis and malaria are the world &apos;s greatest killers and are the most serious diseases affecting the world today .
the European Court of Justice will then rule on what is lawful .
finally , I would like to emphasise the figures concerning the international response .
Commissioner , that is very disappointing in my view and I have decided to focus on this revision .
instead of pretending that the answer lies only at national level , we need strong , coherent , European-wide responses , coordinating actions at the European , national and regional levels .
the first point is agreements reached at WTO level and the second one could be the budget .
the debate is closed .
- ( NL ) The Council has the power to make a different proposal from the one the Commission and Parliament had in mind after Parliament has agreed to it at second reading . It is a clever idea , therefore , to accept an amended proposal but not the legislative resolution at this stage .
does the European Commission have any plans to coordinate the national positions in the event of a nuclear disaster ?
moreover , in the Commission &apos;s consultations on the new 2020 strategy , insufficient attention is paid to matters of equality between men and women .
action in favour of the elderly and disabled , and against racism , is being jeopardized .
the opening of the networks in Europe to rail freight traffic has proved its worth .
the recent history of Eastern Turkestan is sadly a very typical example of this .
what we must do instead is ensure strictly equal access to these posts for everyone , without discrimination .
the UK Presidency ’ s offhand manner towards its partners in general and to the new Member States in particular has , this time round , crossed the threshold between what is acceptable and what is not .
Mr President , the last speaker began by saying that Luxembourg is going to have serious problems , at any rate the presidency .
in writing . - Grants the Registrar of the Court of Justice discharge in respect of the implementation of the Court of Justice budget for the financial year 2009 .
in my view , a study of the operation of macroeconomic policy during this period suggests it is helping to handle the crisis .
the package of proposals that I mentioned before will , therefore , be completed a bit later this year with a proposal for a directive that will cover the issue of temporary residence permits so as to ensure the protection of various victims of trafficking including the victims of trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation .
I voted in favour of censure because if , in such a clear-cut case , the European Parliament fails to accept its responsibilities with regard to the Commission and abandons the attempt to control the Commissions &apos;s activities rigorously , it no longer has any reasons to exist .
regulations and agreements to provide cross-border healthcare already exist , and these can be improved without calling into question the responsibilities and rights of Member States over the ownership and management of their national health services , which we feel must be public , universal and accessible to all .
politicians have been either unable or unwilling to explain to the citizens that the freedom to provide services results in new jobs and faster economic growth .
however , it is difficult to make a proposal of this kind that would take account of the particular situation involved in every single case .
their people deserve it more than ever before and . I believe that we will very soon be followed by our European governments .
today , however , we are voting for the future of half a billion people , for a future of peace and peaceful coexistence in tolerance and in diversity .
on this basis , the Commission has set out a two-pronged approach to financial sector taxation .
that is what I wanted to say , Mr President .
Mrs Green , you are absolutely right .
this suggests that there is no immediate urgency to lower the current age limit .
in writing . - It is incredibly important that the unique needs of every ACP country are taken into account in EPA agreements .
of course , I would say to Mr Schwab and to many others of you that , at the end of this debate , we will definitely have to decide on more important or more specific priorities than the ones that we ourselves have been able to establish , even though we have already identified 29 or 30 main priorities out of 50 .
there are signs of considerable improvement in some systems but , overall , there is much progress still to be made .
in my view NATO will continue in the future too to form the basis of our continent &apos;s military security - and this will include a US presence .
it was clear in this context that arsonists , who profit by destroying forests , are encouraged by shortcomings in or the lack of forest registers , or by poorly defined land use .
I say this because the report , as drawn up at present , does not make it possible to draw useful conclusions and can be no help either for the Commission , or for the Council .
4 . (
this is where we draw together the two issues which we are discussing today - the Draft Supplementary and Amending Budget , with massive movements of money on the one hand and own resources on the other . In other words , the issue is this : how much is the public actually paying for Europe ?
( EL ) Mr President , in paragraphs 9 , 10 and 11 , it says that Parliament calls on &apos; ... the Convention and the IGC ... &apos; .
rather than condemn CEDEFOP out of hand by refusing discharge , we propose that discharge should be deferred .
Mrs El Saadawi is in danger of being sent to prison .
the outgoing Italian Presidency presented a number of proposals .
I hope that it will be a good example of a new way of cooperating .
in 1986 , the University of Los Angeles examined 3000 women who had had implants for at least six years and found no risk of increasing neoplasia or to mobility .
Amnesty International , the IFHR and France Liberté have launched a new campaign to defend Leonard Peltier and fight the unacceptable number of human rights violations in the United States .
six - this is a very important point and I hope that it will be retained - all courier and express delivery services , which have contributed to a sharp increase in accidents in the transport sector , are included in the regulation .
we have to take on board the arguments of the sceptics and we have to challenge them .
( RO ) Mister President , I would like to thank Commissioner Verheugen for having introduced on the agenda of the EU-USA summit the visa issue that my country &apos;s citizens are concerned with , and I represent them here in the European Parliament .
we want to meet with you at the end of next year , and we ask you to give us some clear proposals as to the scope of a universal service to serve a better information society and as to the contribution of new operators to the funding of universal service .
I am certainly prepared to have a calmer discussion with the Commissioner .
moreover , the most inquisitive among us will even be able to request the exact composition .
Turkey does not yet appear to be taking the road to membership of the Union ; its actions suggest this .
furthermore , the European Parliament must accept that it will have the final say on non-compulsory expenditure in Category II and that it should negotiate for all it is worth on Category I. All I have to do now is congratulate Mr Tillich , the rapporteur , once again on his openness to agreement and compromise .
it also presupposes that Africa will receive its fair share of the benefits of the growth of the world economy , and will become a centre of attraction for the flows of capital and technologies in which it is so cruelly lacking , so that it can assume primary responsibility for its own development and contribute to the greater equilibrium of the emerging international community .
those governments tend to take a minimalist position on the European role in public health and on the whole it has been far too negative and far too blinkered .
funds allocated to infrastructure improvements and other aid funds are being directed mostly to wealthier areas that are already well developed .
every individual has the right to appeal to the courts .
factual information is a way of despatching the myths , the lies as they were referred to here .
I would therefore ask you to support Amendments Nos 31 and 32 .
furthermore , we have all been witnesses to the frequent bad use of the Internet .
global warming is the most important question . It is important that we should all ratify the Kyoto Protocol .
at the same time I would like to thank you for trying to clear up any misunderstandings .
11 . Addressing the challenge of water scarcity and droughts in the European Union (
above all , it is a proposal that manages to find a balance between the various interests concerned .
we need somebody who has the ability to detect crime but who also has an enhanced ability to deal with really difficult public order situations as well .
Madam President , I should first like to thank Parliament for accepting our request that this proposal be treated as urgent ; in particular , I should like to thank the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy and its chairman , Mr von Wogau .
the next item is voting time .
I therefore urge our rapporteur and friend , Mr Galeote Quecedo , to perhaps incorporate some of the amendments that have been tabled and to ensure that a process is initiated , that an appeal is made to the Council and that , for once , our Parliament does not fall short of the position of the Council and the Commission , as unfortunately has been the case for the last ten years .
this is why a process for making administrative and legal appeals also needs to be provided for citizens affected by the misuse of this data input .
I would like to make a few comments because I am sure that some Members of this Parliament did not listen to my first speech , when I talked about the soft fruit sector .
this policy will not help to create new jobs but , on the contrary , will be another step backwards for women and the effect will be to reduce the role of women to that of an assisted person and saddle them with an inferior status .
I am concerned about what will happen if the Kyoto Protocol does not come into force .
it is vital that this problem be addressed more forcefully by setting up producer organisations and by ensuring that the growers in the new countries are also able to gain a foothold in the market compared to huge supermarket chains .
to put it in simple terms , the goal is to help developing countries to export goods to us .
I would like to congratulate those involved on having worked so hard to make it possible for us to reach a first reading agreement so that this legislation can be adopted in good time before the next European elections .
my second point is a general one and relates to the actual nature of the talks .
( Loud and sustained applause ) Many Members expressed the wish that our colleague should hear their congratulations directly , so I propose that one member of each group should now extend congratulations to our colleague , for one minute .
the case of the Belgian Hainaut is significant .
one last point : the European Parliament needs to have a look at its own staffing policy .
however , the Taliban position on women and the many obstacles which the Taliban régime has created for the non-governmental organisations which operate in the country make this task extremely difficult .
the Sixth Programme contains an important chapter calling for the protection of the marine environment to be strengthened . It also calls for environmental issues to be integrated into all other policies , and for commitment to a clear plan of action to curb the negative impact on biodiversity .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
secondly , there is no efficiency in a single electricity market .
the privatisation of these services and its implications for the quest for profit , for high returns and for the exploitation of a work force with precarious contracts , does not make for effective security .
. one of the reasons why this discussion is on the table now is that the Court of Auditors has pointed out the difficulties of maintaining the present situation .
if we are serious about tackling poverty then we must tackle conflict .
the facts are as follows : the Commission has proposed a contribution of EUR 60 million to the Global Fund to fight AIDS / HIV , tuberculosis and malaria .
it is clear that we are facing problems and that adjustments will have to be made , but improving our safety , improving traffic safety , improving security in ports is a necessity and an obligation which we must fulfil .
Madam President , it is a matter of deepest concern and regret for us all that the prospects for a just and lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has receded in recent months .
strengthening economic governance should go hand in hand with reinforcing the democratic legitimacy of the decisions taken , because economic governance cannot be dissociated from financial market regulation and supervision .
they have worked very hard on this .
his predecessor had been murdered - between them there had been a councillor who resigned her seat because she was threatened - and it is clear that they are determined to prevent the People &apos;s Party from having a representative , duly elected by the people , on that particular council .
we must be self-disciplined and make sure that problem does not arise .
that is the direction in which we should all be moving together .
they are entitled to see an improvement in the way they are able to track the progress of their petitions .
 
I am not disappointed because my fellow countrymen from Salses to Guadamar , from Fraga to Maó , have already come to the logical conclusion . The State of Catalonia must be re-established if we are to be able to contribute fully to Europe .
then there are Amendments Nos 3 , 5 and 8 dealing with waste which , according to Article 39 of the Fourth Lomé Convention , may not be exported to ACP countries .
Mr President , it is clear to me that proponents of the rejected Constitution see enlargement as a bandwagon to secure implementation of parts of that Constitution .
since I cannot go into detail on all the points raised , I should like to discuss those that I find particularly interesting in this context .
if we are firm and prudent we will create legislation that serves the cause of cultural cooperation and at the same time goes further to meet the requirements of transparency and good management .
these efforts seem to bear fruit .
firstly , the aim of any military strike must be clear .
Mr Chanterie , I can &apos;t just answer that off the cuff - please let me have a copy of the survey and we &apos;ll look into it .
now the managers of these large banks , who are still paying themselves bonuses of millions of euros , for example , at ING which has deficits of several billion , are to be given the opportunity to put their money into tax havens and to avoid paying tax .
in my opinion , the EGF has proved its worth , and my only concern is that the new Member States have not made greater use of it .
the integration of these states means far more than restructuring national economic systems to adapt them to new legal norms and regulations .
I would like to point out here that the well-known problem of the estuaries of the Tigris and Euphrates and the problem of the marshlands are not of Saddam Hussein &apos;s making .
Mr President , I have listened to what the Council and Commission representatives have said , but in my opinion , the events in Kosovo call in addition for a short digression into history .
but the diagnosis , if static , if it continues for the situation , is always unsatisfactory , and particularly when it fails to identify the causes clearly , and on that account cannot be used to attack the roots of the evil .
here the question arises why the reasons given by the USA cannot be accepted , namely that this amongst other things serves to check the safety of existing stocks .
Madam President , together with the Altener programme , the SAVE programme is our only weapon for achieving the 8 % reduction targets to which we committed ourselves in the Kyoto Protocol .
this would also give ordinary people throughout the European Union time to lobby for referenda on this issue .
Mr President , the Socialist Group is also extremely concerned about the unrest that has arisen in Chad since the re-election of Idriss Deby .
to be honest , Mr Rübig , last year was not an easy one for the risk capital market .
that is why it is crucial for us to be able to deliver our opinion when we vote on this later this month in Brussels , and it is crucial that these things are ready on time .
I welcome the view expressed in the report that ICT products for the elderly should be affordable and user-friendly .
moreover , the Commission confirmed that it will remain faithful to current practice , and will refrain from submitting proposals to the regulating committee that involve research activities in which human embryos are destroyed , not least when this involves the extraction of stem cells .
I am voting for this resolution , which recommends the implementation of the Association and Stabilisation Agreement with the EU , but regrets that the Council is not considering the opening of negotiations as recommended by the Commission .
therefore , within this passionate and extremely complex debate , I believe that this is an occasion when – and I hope this is demonstrated in the vote – we have been able to achieve unity in the House – in Parliament – so that we can express ourselves clearly .
the third is , are we to be a Europe without a democratic deficit , with power in the hands of the citizens , or are we to be a Europe in which European elections are held and we have abstentions of 70 , 60 or 50 % ?
nowhere in the text , Mr Schwab , is there a stipulation on this Internal Market Test , and I would suggest that you need to read the text more closely .
we cannot accept the weakening of the rights of people with reduced mobility also in this regulation .
at this moment and in this debate , I would like to respond that we need less centralisation , we need more confidence in the market and we need more of the market and of market mechanisms , because what is actually happening today , not only in the EU and not only in the euro area , but also in the United States and in other countries of this kind , is a story of unbelievable failure of all state intervention .
seventy-five per cent of respondents claimed that the worsening of their health is attributable to the work they do .
each country has a forestry policy and authorities for the Forestry Industry .
for this reason , it is important to strike a balance between exploitation , on the one hand , and maximum protection for this sensitive system , on the other .
as for the informing of Parliament , the Commission is confident that the requests made in the report we are discussing for extensive transmission will be agreed in Council .
for the last thirty years , significant improvements have been secured for the environment in areas such as the reduction in pesticides , chemical fertilisers and animal faeces .
we need to gain an insight into what companies are like now .
in relation to road safety and the target that the Union has set itself of halving the number of road accident deaths by 2010 , if the driving licence issuing and renewal system were to contribute even just minimally to improving people ’ s driving knowledge and skills and to keeping a check on drivers ’ mental and physical conditions , if it were even to make the tiniest contribution to improving road safety in Europe , it would definitely be welcome .
let us learn then the lessons from this .
it has also helped the 10 new Member States to build the institutional network of Euro Info Centres that coordinate the activities aimed at supporting and developing small and medium-sized enterprises .
I would like to thank the Commission and those staff in its directorates-general who have been patient in their explanations and have explained their rationale for preparing the preliminary draft budget .
in 1999 , it press-ganged Turkey into becoming a candidate country , and continued on this wrong track by opening accession negotiations with Ankara in 2005 .
more exact services of a higher order will have to be paid for in order to guarantee the refinancing of the running and development costs .
at the same time , Parliament &apos; s resolution contains a number of important additional paragraphs and remarks .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the introduction of the single European currency on 1 January 1999 in eleven Member States of the European Union has been agreed .
these trusts are fighting it out with billions of dollars - 13 million , more than in Russia - for the Kazakh energy reserves , which are considerable . Nor does it bother the building groups , including Bouygues , which have made considerable amounts of money thanks to the construction of the new capital , Astana .
account must be taken , moreover , of the fact that small regional economies dependent on crops such as rice are more threatened than ever in a globalised and liberalised world .
so inclusion of all drivers is important , both on occupational health and safety grounds and on operational safety grounds .
Mr President , the arrogant and rabble-rousing European political class has found the ideal scapegoat to carry the blame for its own base economic behaviour .
I hope that satisfies you , Mr de Jong .
agenda for next sitting : see Minutes
it is the current ban on growing and importing GMOs that for years has cut off Europe &apos;s scientific community , its consumers and farmers from the positive developments in the field of green genetic engineering .
the Oslo Accords and the interim accord request a regrouping in three stages according to unilateral decisions by Israel .
this morning &apos;s dossiers are an apt illustration of that .
it would be useful to remind him of his question .
but women are not the source of the actual problem .
if that is what you see as your objective , then it is in order for you to just say so .
for example , what criteria and what priorities will be used to determine how European airborne fire-fighting units are to be used where fires break out in several countries at once , for example , in Portugal and Greece at the same time .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission welcomes Mr Botz &apos;s comprehensive and balanced report and I hope that we will be able to translate most of its findings into practice .
on the one hand , we are saying that the application of the Protocol is a short-term obligation on the part of Turkey , over the next one or two years .
the high short-term costs associated with the introduction of paths towards implementation of the flexicurity model must also be borne in mind , together with the significant burden on budgets .
I certainly do not see myself as groping in the dark , as Mr Bonde put it , but I do think we are on the road towards the light .
it is now up to the Parliament to shoulder its responsibilities .
one cannot draw general conclusions about Afghan asylum seekers &apos; need for protection , but statistics show that the recognition rate for this group has increased over the last few months .
this report is a positive step , as was the report presented in this House a few years ago by the President .
in both cases the Article 29 Working Party has issued a positive opinion .
it has been a challenging process , mainly due to the very restrictive nature of the recast .
unfortunately , Parliament sabotaged the Environment Committee &apos;s demands by contenting itself with requesting further research .
the fight against extremism is not an easy task , which is why the Pakistani Government and all those citizens who agree that intolerance and extremism are unacceptable need our support .
both types of response must be fully accepted , and the European Union must prohibit the export of non-hazardous waste to the countries approached .
at this moment , with regard to Latin America , the European Union is the main trading partner of nine countries , and the second biggest partner of eight countries .
for seven months , there was an &apos; ice age &apos; . Austrian ministers were no longer permitted to take part in informal Council meetings , but Austria was still allowed to continue to pay fees as a net contributor .
in response to Mrs Corbey , I should like to clarify that there is a difference with regard to manufacturing authorisation - Doha concerns manufacturing .
the official line is , of course , that negotiations with Turkey can be suspended at any time if it transpires that that country is clearly flouting the human rights conditions .
we shall have the opportunity to do so on another occasion , on the basis of the Commission &apos;s report , which will of course be forwarded to you in its entirety .
the support we so magnanimously demand for this or that represents money taken from the pockets of taxpayers ; mothers and fathers who decide every month what is their real priority and what will have to wait .
the same applies , as a matter of fact , to the way in which the possible accession of Turkey to the European Union is being handled .
these attempts surely cannot succeed in the long run because the youthful population is impatient for change showing that Islam and guarantees of rights and freedoms are perfectly compatible .
there is no doubt that Europe can only become competitive if it successfully overcomes the territorial disparities that exist between the various regions .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
we have to be clear in our own minds about how great a burden they are on Lebanon .
Mr President , I want to congratulate Mr Kellett-Bowman for his excellent report .
I hope that the huge acceptance of this report at Parliament level will encourage the blocking minority to re-think their stance .
at the end of the day , that is the yardstick by which Turkey &apos;s fitness for accession will be assessed .
the report remains vague on this subject .
to facilitate integration , a list of the funds required for facilitation purposes needs to be drawn up .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to discuss the issue of PFOA briefly , and then go on to make a very fundamental point .
partly as a result of this , freight transport has become increasingly cheap over the years . This encourages even more transport and increases the environmental impact still further .
( the President declared the common position approved as amended )
would you let me have these documents so that I can read them , after I have had them translated ? I can then determine what they contain in terms of information and communication , which I can only welcome as the Commissioner for Regional Policy , and what is propaganda .
there are currently several large energy programmes underway in Asia which are having an acknowledged negative impact on the environment . These include the building of large dams which are causing significant environmental and social problems .
he died on the way to Catania .
while I welcome this White Paper , I regret that it confines itself to a catalogue of questions and principles .
I will return to the UK position later .
but the EU &apos;s proposals contain more than just targets .
I would draw attention to this year ’ s result , which is that we have EUR 185 million at our disposal , EUR 45 million for the Peace II programme , EUR 40 million for the agencies – which are obviously among the Council ’ s really important priorities and are always threatening to displace important programmes in heading III , which yield added value for Europe – and EUR 100 million for the reconstruction of Iraq .
otherwise we will unfortunately be obliged to admit that our compassion is often short-lived .
if we could only restore property rights , we would begin to give Afghanistan the basis of a flourishing civil society with an independent magistracy and , in due course , representative government .
on this point , it is unacceptable that Germany and Spain are blocking the process which is to be undertaken in Luxembourg in a few days time .
the Common Position , which we have reached with all the Member States through considerable effort , provides for the opening up of international markets for passenger transport , including cabotage in connection with international journeys , as of 2010 , but initially without opening up the national networks .
it should be borne in mind that the absence of a European agreement on worker protection will enable industries to relocate to regions where the workforce is less expensive and has less protection , running the risk that national systems will be harmonized at the lowest level of social security because national governments will be able to cut their expenditure on social protection in order to be competitive .
 
it can no longer pray in aid of the misdemeanours of its predecessors .
we must not lose sight of the benefits of nuclear energy , which produces low carbon dioxide emissions , incurs relatively lower costs and ensures energy independence .
secondly , I would like to thank the rapporteur for the way he has worked with us in preparing this debate and , thirdly , I would repeat on behalf of my Group that in our view - and the Council President said the same - enlargement has so far proved a success and is making a significant contribution to the development of a wider European Union .
at the same time I believe that it would be good for us within the European Union not to practise self-pity , in the sense that we are not doing anything .
we are pleased that this contribution from Parliament stresses , as the main themes and guiding principles , the democratisation , efficiency and greater supervision of the European institutions , exactly where the respective deficits have been most felt and where the risks of disintegration , caused by the significant increase in the number of Member States , were greatest .
Vice-President of the Commission . - Madam President , the Commission very much welcomes Parliament &apos;s own-initiative report on the efficient and effective EU funding of decommissioning of nuclear power plants in the new Member States .
the EU has been trying for years to reduce the fleet capacity of European fishermen .
the incremental cost is much lower .
its role can be preserved only if the production of electricity from nuclear energy and the subsequent activities of the fuel cycle can take place under conditions acceptable to European citizens , so far as public health and safety are concerned .
indeed , in many parts of Europe , a great many of the problems about ozone are not necessarily a consequence of activities by that individual Member State .
Lisbon must not become a synonym for an opaque European Union in which parliamentary supervision has been steamrollered .
this painful observation should make the pro-Europeans think about the radical reforms needed at Member State level to limit as much as possible the disastrous consequences of the economic and financial crisis , a crisis which originated in the ultra-liberalism and globalisation that are so dear to Brussels .
let me now return to the second aspect , that being the recommendation from the British House of Lords , on which Mr Kallas believes we should act . We have a system .
the second is to define the necessary steps to be taken by each Member State : firstly , to collaborate within Marine Regions or Sub-Regions ; then to define the state of the water and of biodiversity in these seas ; then to define a good ecological status and some priority environmental objectives ; and finally to draw up a plan of action and some measures to be taken .
I hope that the Members of this House will support this agreement , which seeks to respect the rights of passengers so that the practices in question occur as rarely as possible .
incidentally , this also conforms with the view of the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs .
what is the Commission doing in this regard ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen in the Chamber and looking at the monitors in the office , Mr Böge &apos;s report deserves approval .
I would say in conclusion , therefore , that for us the directive as it stands , with the amendments voted through in committee , constitutes the middle ground between the need to pursue scientific progress in biotechnology and the desire to protect human dignity and integrity .
however , there is , of course , also room for a certain amount of parliamentary scrutiny and control by the European Parliament .
what we need to start doing now , in my view , is to see what mistakes we have made and improve what we have done so far .
resumption of the session
we do not have the capacity to solve the problem , but we can move in the right direction as soon as possible and aim for peace .
I feel that all of their contributions shed some much-needed light on the report .
namely , convincing Europe by its economic , legal , financial and political activities that it is a sufficiently committed partner for the EU to ask itself , sooner or later , would it not be worthwhile to include Ukraine in the common European entity ?
its work programme has three distinguishing characteristics : concentration , openness and networking , and consumer-orientation .
we are certainly not doing that .
we also believe that consumers have an absolute right to information , which means that they ought to be able to choose whether to buy products containing genetically modified ingredients or substances .
these include , in particular , bringing democracy to Africa , improving the living conditions of the people there and also the sustainable exploitation of raw materials , which offers benefits for both sides .
now , the Brazilian authorities must act to ensure that the law is applied and extradite Battisti .
I would have thought it useful to remind the Member States of that with this report .
what progress is being made to ensure that accounting procedures are standardised and sufficiently transparent to capture off-balance-sheet activity and any other innovative practices ?
we should not overlook the significant and positive impact that they have on our regions and their populations .
if the Commission were to designate 2011 the European Year of Volunteers , this would allow the EU institutions , in collaboration with voluntary organisations , to work towards common objectives , as I said earlier , to add value at European level .
this is what we want , in order to fight against the employment of people from third countries residing illegally and , above all , to impose sanctions on the employers who profit from these people .
President of the Commission , we need serious , effective and viable external action by the European Union , which needs to speak with one voice in international organisations .
envelopes and ballot papers have been distributed .
the war in Yugoslavia , which is hypocritically and euphemistically referred to as a &apos; humanitarian war &apos; ( ! ! ! ) , has caused major civilian losses and has exacerbated the tragedy of the refugees .
we now have to convince the ones that have not yet decided and those that have said &apos; no &apos; .
one is that we are erecting a &apos; fortress Europe &apos; where foreigners are no longer welcome and where we do not take the slightest notice of the rest of the world .
this month Frontex &apos;s mission continued but we have still seen an increase compared with September of the previous year .
thank you , too , to the Commission for presenting this communication on the European agenda for culture .
I refer to the German firms Diehl , Rheinmetall and EADS .
we have been able to do something similar in improving work productivity so why not in improving the productivity of natural resources ?
this would allow too many anomalous projects to slip through .
the &apos; Energy and Climate Change &apos; package also envisages the introduction of the Clean Development Mechanism , which allows Member States to make energy-efficient investments and use the carbon credits in developing countries .
the consumer , therefore , will be well informed about the nature of the product .
the Commission has no answer to this .
everyone knows that it is in our interests to get that Constitution through in one form or another , most certainly not in the form of a &apos; mini-treaty &apos; .
however , as I said in my introduction , the debate on the 2011 budget will not be linked solely to the 2011 budget as such .
the amendments to the Decourrière report aim to make INTERREG more maritime-oriented .
this is therefore the last opportunity to depart from a passive policy .
I would tackle the root of the problem , which actually lies in other matters .
if my information is correct , the Socialist Group will not be discussing the amendments until tomorrow evening .
that is the view of the Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism Committee of this Parliament .
I am also grateful to our Commission colleagues , who provided us with a great deal of information and were most understanding , although I very much regret - as did the entire committee - that one Commission colleague decided in the end that none of the amendments was acceptable .
I would like to thank Mrs Evans for her excellent work .
finally , the amendment tabled by the rapporteur is perfectly logical and I can , therefore , give it my wholehearted support .
in the medium term , Europe has the problem of how to disengage its economy from the US cycle .
but if we look into how to achieve this , the opinions are greatly divided .
only by subsequent assessment will it be possible to establish whether or not the aim of the programme , namely to create more jobs , has actually been achieved .
the first thing that the poor cut back on if prices rise is alcohol consumption .
we are talking about eliminating poverty , about sustainable development and about gradual integration of the ACP countries into the world economy .
stock management issues are also important .
the Committee on Budgets had the task of examining and evaluating the financial statement for this Consumer Policy Strategy .
after we have marked with crosses the two to be voted for , do we have to confirm our vote or leave it as it is ?
in other words , the top priority of the European Union must at this moment be the successful conclusion of the Doha Development Agenda .
the investment quota alone would ensure that the top six pay-TV operators would invest ECU 300m in our industry - the total of the European MEDIA II programme - and that they do not solely recycle cheap imported programming .
it must also improve the European Union &apos;s competitiveness and create jobs across the whole Union .
in all cases , we have to be firemen and attend to the most urgent things first , waiting for the next conflagration .
I believe that this is one of the policies , at a time when we are preparing to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon , through which Europe can offer the world a lesson on the ways in which these hateful crimes against the human person can be eradicated .
this is the kind of arbitrary restriction of freedoms to which agreements of this type expose us .
I was the rapporteur on the Agreement with Macedonia .
the Commission should consider using Article 182 ( 5 ) as a legal basis for all future proposals for joint programming of research activities .
there may , of course , be a connection , if – as in the case of Turkey and Croatia – screening reports on a number of candidates are presented at the same time , and this can result in a certain amount of correspondence .
Commissioner , particularly in these regions , there is simply no alternative to the farm structures which have survived - mainly cooperatives - that is , no alternative which could guarantee comprehensive management , which is what we all wish for .
on the subject of Africa I would also like to tell you , honourable Members , of my sadness on hearing the news about the Bulgarian nurses , as previous speakers have mentioned .
finally , considering development of investment in the European cinema industry to be extremely important , the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy calls upon the Member States to pursue a policy of making sums reinvested for the creation of new jobs tax-deductible , and stresses the importance of establishing a guarantee fund as one of the measures necessary for the development of the independent audiovisual industry which encourages new talent and develops a cultural content of European tradition .
( FR ) The oral amendment would be a first point , worded as follows :
after all , if there is one example of a political decision-making system crying out for rationalised and coordinated organisation , it is unquestionably the European regulatory agencies .
however , from an EU perspective , some activities are being duplicated here .
the cornerstone will be the concept of the environmental life cycle and this will also address one of the concerns formulated in Mrs Myller &apos;s report .
it is the view of the Commission , however , that the geographical criterion &quot; island region &apos; is of itself not appropriate for the general application of exceptional provisions , whether this is done within the scope of the Structural Funds or any other Community policy .
finally , economic , social and human development within the Black Sea region is an important premise for transforming the Black Sea into a stable and prosperous space .
the EU has for all too long indulged Sharon &apos;s government in its attempts to obtain influence over it , and the only result is Sharon &apos;s refusing the EU access to talk with Arafat .
so it is now a question of actively implementing - both in the House and within the groups - the budgetisation system on which the Budgets Committee has already held a hearing .
Mr President , very briefly , we agree with the Commission &apos;s findings on the importance of tobacco production for certain areas , but we disagree with its proposals , which conflict with those findings .
in old installations there are supposedly closed systems from which substances are still disappearing .
in response specifically to a key point in the Pittella report , I may conclude that we have many points of agreement and one point of difference .
few people today can have any doubt about that .
it would make for greater predictability and security in ensuring that the necessary measures are also adopted in time .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( DE ) Madam President , our heartfelt thanks go to the rapporteur .
that is all the more reason why we must now press for European money also to be used in the way Europe requires , not squandered on consumption expenditure , not used to finance windfall gains when businesses move in , and not misused by state or semi-state authorities for other than structural policy purposes .
if parts of allocated quotas go unused because of particular foreseeable circumstances , however , then bilateral contractual arrangements between the Member States are still the appropriate way of dealing with that .
the situation of 1998 cannot be allowed to arise again .
the innumerable acts of struggle , strikes , protests and demonstrations are causes for hope and faith in a better future , in particular , the demonstration by the General Confederation of Portuguese Workers ( CGTP ) on 19 March .
we Spanish Socialists identify in particular with this text because it recognises the importance of the forest sector in the European Union , on the basis of broader criteria than the purely economic and also because it highlights the need to produce a single interpretation of the concept of forest .
the time is crucial : it is important for all the actors on the stage , each as regards his own competence , to be equal to this very difficult situation .
the agreement also mentions that the parties intend to establish cooperation in the area of scientific and technological research , so that cooperation will be increased in various areas and that both sides , the EU and Brazil , will enjoy the economic and social benefits of this cooperation .
all of that has to be reviewed and the parameters established , and there has not been the time to determine the methods and time-scales for this .
however , they represent a needless risk to citizens &apos; health .
the main points emanating from our discussion revolve around the principle of keeping the concept of social and economic cohesion and its most representative instrument , namely the Cohesion Fund .
the old saying is true here that not every problem in Europe is a problem for Europe .
if this cooperation mechanism is not going to uphold democratic reforms in the former Soviet states which have been invited , this means that it will be dead in the water .
that , Mr President , is the thrust of our programme .
the promotion of partnership in implementing reform of the areas of employment and integration .
as a result , they would become a menace on the roads .
unfortunately , the Bulgarian Government was unable to help its citizens during this crisis .
we need clear , precise rulings on what age is referred to , and we need clear precise regulations to make the production , sale and - let me say clearly , though I know it is a matter of dispute - possession of child pornography a punishable offence ..
I would remind everyone that the Ancient Greeks said &apos; man is the measure of all things &apos; 2 500 years ago .
therefore we can agree to the amendment proposed by Parliament that certain fireworks do not fall under the directive if they are produced by manufacturers for their own use and if their use by the manufacturer himself has been approved by the respective Member State .
however , there is still much progress to be made .
I note , as do several of my colleagues , the happy coincidence of the particularly notable visit of the Prime Minister of Quebec to Paris and our debate on relations between the European Union and Canada .
two decibels may not appear much , but three decibels represents nearly a cut of the noise by half .
he knows what he is talking about , he is competent , and he can also communicate his convictions , something that is important to the European Union .
the committee was clear with regard to noise and health .
how well prepared are the candidate countries to implement the requirements of the Schengen area ?
there is the risk that , in the event of extra environmental compensation not being used to cover genuine environmental damage and disruption , certain airports may attract disruptive flights in order to boost their income .
I would also ask Mr Blak , who has now asked to speak once again , and Mr Valverde López to note what I have said .
do not come and tell us that this is complicated , because the projects are ready .
the proposed amendments would simply duplicate or encroach on these documents .
this is a good example of the fact that no market is impossible and that , in the long term , it is possible to achieve a great deal by means of measures to strengthen competition .
the abovementioned Chernobyl nuclear power station accident opened people &apos;s eyes to the dangers of nuclear power and increased the Finns &apos; opposition to nuclear power to such an extent that the Finnish parliament has halted all new nuclear power station projects for the time being .
the long-term , reassuring stabilisation of the Balkans is possible only by way of European integration .
in Germany , the magazine Der Spiegel is already writing about widespread political contempt - and rightly so .
the success of the programme will depend on the availability of resources and expertise .
Mr President , your kind words just now about my country have touched me deeply .
we need to see intelligent measures taken by governments .
it is because we agree on the importance of the Lisbon goals that it is important that the WTO round be well-prepared .
in any case , the Nice Treaty already requires us to adapt our institutional set-up following the accession of the 27th member .
there should be an agreement amongst the three institutions .
another matter that I would like to address is the question of the money provided in aid and how that money is developed .
in the area of the social sciences especially , this often happens .
I know that in Ireland , my own country , the government has bilateral agreements signed with Romania and Nigeria and is planning to sign more in the future .
with regard to Bosnia and Herzegovina , we are currently implementing aid .
instead , the EU must abolish quota systems of all kinds within the agricultural sphere .
in saying that , I am , of course , thinking of France .
although we appreciate that PVC is not the only issue here , we are ready to back those amendments which seek either to ban or to restrict the use of PVC .
it is the idea of overcoming the demons and enmities of the past through European integration .
it is not acceptable – it is quite wrong – for these things to be tied to some sort of Procrustes ’ bed !
it is obviously inappropriate to bombard the Presidency , because we know the Presidency , and we know it is doing its level best , as they say .
Europe needs this rule .
there is still little opportunity for ordinary citizens to supervise the work of the central bank and have a say in monetary policy .
therefore , when rules concerning that category of workers are discussed in May 2006 , I shall be one of those encouraging the old Member States , the 15 , to get rid of the barriers that still stand in the way of workers from the countries that acceded to the European Union in 2004 .
I understand the nature of the conflict very well indeed , as well as the feelings associated with the conflict because of its nature , but I believe that , in carrying out the task before us , what we are doing is right .
composition of committees and delegations : see Minutes
however , the EU welcomed the efforts made by Brazil and Turkey that led to the Tehran Declaration , pointing out its shortcomings but also emphasising its value as a potential confidence-building instrument and inviting Iran to seize the chance to resume serious negotiations .
employers must take reasonable steps to enable disabled employees to do their jobs .
secondly , the rate of withholding tax applied in international tax agreements only rarely exceeds 15 % . Thirdly , too high a rate would make all attempts to limit capital flight completely futile .
there is therefore a massive gap between needs and resources provided .
for that , you need officials who have a little bit more time to go there .
most of the women who are ensnared in this way come from regions with adverse economic and social conditions , and high unemployment .
the problem , of course , is known both at European Union and Member State level .
there will be one in 112 local areas .
as a member of this Committee of Inquiry , I would like to protest against such excessive claims .
Mr Schulz , it is perfectly clear : there are domestic elections .
and the reality is that , sooner or later , Cyprus will be a united Cyprus , because this unnatural border , this last border of walls and barbed wire , can no longer be sustained .
solidarity on the part of the EU must also , of course , extend to include third countries that until now have been recipients of EIB loans . Among these are the Balkan countries , the Mediterranean countries and the ACP countries .
I have explained to the honourable Member that the Commission has already initiated a number of investigations where it appears that anti-competitive behaviour contributes to the problems identified by the energy sector inquiry .
report ( A5-0393 / 2002 ) by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna , on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries , on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing an emergency Community measure for scrapping fishing vessels &#91; COM ( 2002 ) 190 - C5-0315 / 2002 - 2002 / 0115 ( CNS ) &#93; ;
it is our freedom that creates noise .
from research we know that innovation is especially to be found among these young , new companies .
we hope that the Commissioner will be making some strong proposals on that point .
if something of that kind is not possible , we must ask ourselves whether online transactions are mere pie in the sky for the time being .
what do we need a WTO for , if those with power continue to machinate independently , as soon as they themselves come up for public scrutiny ?
in order to achieve this goal , a common European Union strategy is essential , which will have to set out the ways in which the stated goal is going to be achieved .
as rapporteur for the strategy in the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights and Gender Equality , however , I am disappointed that the main reporting committee did not take account of more than one of our 13 amendments .
thus , the proposed directive does not apply to the mobility of students wishing to exchange student status for immigrant worker status .
therefore , in order to stave off this threat , the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development voted in favour of an amendment that excludes the possibility of extending the wine-growing zone to include any Member State other than those set out in the amendment .
.
Mr President , I too was surprised by my colleague Mr Donnelly &apos; s attack on my colleague Mr Van Velzen .
we should tailor the scheme to better help those developing economies which most need the preferences , and ensure that it becomes an even more efficient development and foreign policy tool by providing incentives for good governance .
( NL ) This Corbett report has just one purpose , and one purpose only , namely to muzzle the right-wing national voices in the European Parliament .
before we do this , let me ask a question which is perhaps not as simple as it appears .
a particularly important point is that by no means the whole of the Serbian population group supports the disastrous and bloody policy of the leadership dominated by Karadzic and Mladic .
as soon as it breaks out , that is when the dangers occur , and so one of the messages has to be that we need to look at the at-risk areas of our European Union to see where we should be highlighting the risk and monitoring it for the future .
the importance of flax production being subsidised in such areas of the European Union cannot be overemphasised .
even the worst terrorist is entitled to a fair trial .
in my opinion , therefore , we should concentrate on what is not controversial , especially as there are very many things that are not controversial and on which we are all agreed : education , strengthening the position of women , protecting motherhood , good nutrition , access to skilled medical assistance and obstetric care .
the negative effects of volatile organic compounds are many .
the European Parliament will therefore continue to make its essential contribution to the process of bringing together the European peoples and nations and of truly raising the awareness of the citizens of the Europe of Fifteen and of the applicant countries to the advantages and also to the obligations inherent in European integration .
I commend it to the House .
instead of the 2 % of students currently taking part in Erasmus , we feel the figure should be nearer 10 % .
apart from discussing the common positions and statements approved by the Council , it is very difficult for me to add anything further .
I would like to remark on what was said by Mr Schulz and others , namely that we must remember what was happening in our continent a hundred years ago , seventy-five years ago or perhaps , as in the case of my own country , twenty years ago or less .
when a text has been finalised it will serve as a basis for the negotiations with the European countries outside the Community .
the key challenges for the revision will be to define the scope of the directive .
indeed it is not even a Member State issue .
this means that it has to be built up in a gradual and pragmatic way .
the Commissioner struck me as somewhat acidic in his comments , and the environment is acidic enough as it is without the need for an acidic Commissioner .
Mr Cavada is right to emphasise the way in which the Constitutional Treaty opens up many new prospects of cooperation and codecision involving our institutions .
an evil which has not been condemned , an evil which is tolerated cannot be accepted by this Parliament !
as time has gone by , the internal market has demonstrated its benefits to the consumer as well as to European businesses , and it has contributed to our economic growth .
I , for one , was very happy with it , but deliberately did not say very much .
I hope that when he publishes the macroeconometric model he will do so in a form which makes it available and easily usable by outside researchers , perhaps on CD-ROM .
like her , I find it totally unacceptable that the Council should have to decide by unanimity on specific authorisation to a Member State to apply this reduced rate of VAT .
the debate is closed .
the 2001 European Innovation Scoreboard gives us a starting point for the Union &apos; s strategy to enhance its overall competitiveness , by providing a common measure of a country &apos;s performance using 17 indicators .
this is evident from the very fact that the title of the convention has been changed to the Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine .
on the basis of the current regulation , the ERDF already supports intervention in the housing sector , which also covers energy efficiency , but only for the new Member States ( EU-12 ) and in certain conditions .
Greece is having to shoulder a burden which is out of proportion to what it can cope with , which is why the European Union urgently needs to take its share of the responsibility , in this specific case by helping Greece to draw up an integrated joint plan to protect the right of asylum and ensure that the Geneva Convention is fully applied .
I do not object to that amendment , but I do not think it really necessary .
one area where we need to be more proactive is the use of cluster bombs .
the efficiency and reliability of the EU common foreign policy are being particularly tested in this region .
perhaps we can then deal with both points together .
it has not yet done this .
it is unlikely that the average consumer understands or is aware and we cannot agree to their full legal rights being abrogated in this way .
as for Mr Deprez &apos;s report , I essentially agree with the second half , when it refers to the necessary consistency required of the Commission if we intend to develop a Community policy concerning external relations in the judicial co-operation sector .
in the short time available to me , I want to focus on a few points .
– Mr President , at the end of the debate you are now getting a hefty dose of Austrian contributions .
the economic slowdown is particularly severe .
a couple of remarks to close with , Mr President . We think it is most important for the return of refugees to be properly coordinated .
while the crisis in Brazil may not be quite so serious it can still have repercussions .
with regard to mobile satellite services , fundamentally the final result offers a balance between political ambition and economic feasibility .
in this connection , I should like to emphasise that the conditions for monitoring such measures have been improved by the fact that the authorities on Mauritius now have to submit a detailed report each year and by the fact that the Commission is able to review payments in the light of whether the various measures have in practice been carried out .
above all , however , how is it possible to mix rogue and democratic states on a list of states that allegedly threaten the peace ?
I propose that the appointment of these six candidates be confirmed .
more and more pigs are kept outdoors , and it is therefore necessary to secure common rules governing access to mud baths and shade and any other facilities relevant to keeping pigs outdoors .
it is however open to question whether a recital , inserted into the directives on contracts and divorced from the regulatory context of those directives , is the most appropriate and effective way of achieving the legitimate objective in view - an objective which the Commission expounded at length in its Green Paper on contracts , suggesting lines of thought and making specific proposals .
on the contrary , they can expect greater insecurity , poverty and increased payments in order to have preventive health protection and care .
we are therefore especially happy to be here and we relish the experience , because we know , ladies and gentlemen , that this Union of Member States which we represent here is the only answer to the problems that the world faces , since traditional States are incapable of finding effective solutions .
there are no amendments .
we want a strong Commission which drives the European integration process forward .
if , when we talk about family reunion , we mean the core family , i.e. spouses and dependent underage children , then it is an excellent measure , which is in the interests of integration policy and it has our full support .
question No 10 by ( H-0607 / 01 ) :
we need to know where the emergency food supplies , the tents and the blankets are .
worse still , there is a considerable danger that the new system as proposed will end up being procyclical and therefore counterproductive for growth and jobs .
 
this worked on the principle that Siberia teaches you a lesson .
except in the case of its own research programmes , the EU lacks competence in the research area , and that is how matters should remain .
this wrong way round approach has been reinforced by the rapporteur and other Members in their speeches .
however , under no circumstances must the demand for food be met by genetic engineering methods .
as concerns the default values for oil sands and oil shale , I am pleased to report that the Commission has recently published reports indicating an average default value for oil sands and a range of indicative default values for oil shales .
all of the circumstances surrounding the farcical trial which took place are extremely suspicious and it is not clear how the uprising itself began or developed .
 
the 25 % which the Member States are going to retain for collection expenses will allow for an administrative improvement in customs efficiency and the fight against fraud , which is an aspect that is frequently pointed out by the Court of Auditors .
Greek producers are small and medium-sized tobacco producers and it is impossible to replace the qualities they cultivate . Essentially , in the infertile soil where the tobacco is grown , it is impossible for them to switch to better varieties in such a short time .
the reform of the banana market and the reform of the sugar market are basically expressions of the same inexorable shift towards a large global market , which , unfortunately , is crushing the weakest and most fragile .
with this new strengthened foreign policy , we as a Union must be more active in the promotion and defence of human rights and fundamental rights in third countries .
a constitutional state is unthinkable without an independent judicial system .
the Council proposal thus has the benefit of making information available more promptly , until , of course , the computerised system that the Commissioner mentioned can provide the information even more quickly , virtually on line .
Mr Schmidt , Mr Trichet , I absolutely cannot go along with these proposals .
he complains about the unequal balance of trade , unfair competition and the development of powerful equipment with the best possible price / quality ratio .
if this cannot be adopted as the objective , then I am naturally prepared to support the proposal to the effect that we should have achieved levels very close to zero by the year 2020 .
we should also like to pay tribute to the sacrifices made by the firefighters and the people that have made efforts to combat the fires .
this was an unknown concept in the East ten years ago and today we are seeing it develop .
Mr President , I would like to refer to Articles 6 and 7 of the European Union Treaty , which indicate , respectively , that that Union is based on respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the Rule of Law . And that , on the proposal of Parliament or the Commission , the Council can note the existence of a clear risk of serious violation of these principles on the part of a Member State .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , if we are going to talk about topicality then all I can say is that you cannot get more topical than Kosovo and Serbia .
animals which die on farm are in any case excluded from the food and feed chain .
it must be obvious to all of us that this is scarcely a suitable basis for maintaining wealth and well-being , and that a more comprehensive examination of the problems is needed .
in addition , all the concerns relating to this mode of transport - refunds , compensation , passenger information , strict liability and complaints - have been covered in a clear manner .
only by extending freedom , human rights and development can we recover our security .
we are all agreed that it requires certain changes , but these should be based on the results of thorough research , and not on industry or trade lobbying .
I wish to make clear that our Presidency has been guided by a different objective .
Garosci report ( A4-0230 / 98 )
I further regret the fact that neither the regions , nor the representative regional organisations were involved in framing the programme .
the ELDR believes that the Union and the international community must maintain pressure on Mr Milosevic and must be prepared , if necessary , to back this with the credible certainty of military intervention .
our Member State governments must ensure that the reforms currently under way are indeed continued .
I can therefore reassure you on this subject ; there should be no difficulty and , in any case , the concern you feel will be largely addressed , as you will see , in the first package , which will come at the end of February and also in the general plan , which will be available by 1 May at the latest .
we have taken good note of your intentions .
. ( PT ) We broadly agree with the rapporteur &apos;s view that the Commission &apos;s basic proposal to reduce sugar quotas by 115 000 tonnes should be rejected .
we have nothing to be proud of .
 
then we took matters in hand and we sorted them out .
we are obliged to watch as undisguised attempts are made in the Security Council to use economic aid as a bribe to induce African states to consent to war .
at present , fossil fuels provide for almost 85 % of the world &apos;s energy needs .
that is why , Madam President-in-Office , it was certainly impressive to see how you , a woman , dealt with those machos like Blair .
without legal means , many people resort to dangerous and illegal ways of circumventing frontiers .
there is a feeling in Parliament , which I think is shared by all Members , that the authorities governing this institution take account of and give great priority to the issue of security .
we should show solidarity with the whole world , but not betray Europe in the name of internationalism .
in the President-in-Office ’ s speech , I was pleased to hear the reference to issues closer to the citizens , who , I believe , are not particularly interested in whether voting is by double majority , whether Spain should have 27 rather than 28 votes or other such things .
the Ministerial Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs on the Mediterranean dialogue , held on 22 and 23 of April in Valencia , warmly welcomed Ecofin and the Barcelona European Council &apos;s conclusions on this matter .
the problem will not be solved just by ignoring the European standard .
at a time when the draft European Constitution , based on a careful rebalancing between politics and economics , appears to be stillborn , I hope , despite everything , that we will not bury its content too hastily .
Mr President , I should like to begin by thanking Commissioner Byrne , something which has not been done today , for I do in fact think that it is a good proposal that the Commission has come up with , a proposal which I should really like to have voted for without changes .
however , making improvements as you have suggested makes sense , and I think that the Member State in question should make the effort to respond to that .
yes , the legal status is intact , but the text is not user-friendly .
many people are asking why this should be .
that is only possible by means of long-term training and a visa requirement , with the club not only taking on responsibility for these children , but also , refraining from treating them later on as their property , but instead paying them fairly .
it would be natural for the EU to embark on closer talks with these countries .
the success of the electoral process in Ukraine - given Ukraine &apos;s geographical and strategic importance - matters to the EU , and to Europe as a whole .
flexibility , at least as we interpret it in Europe , means a set of policies and practices to help the company , the worker , the public sector and the law to adapt to new production requirements .
we will vote in favour of it .
I say with some feeling that I very much hope that Member States will take account of what has been said in this Chamber .
should our starting point be all the advantages , in a narrow sense , which the EU can get from the Arctic region ?
in writing . - ( FR ) At a time when Europe is faced with a major economic crisis , adopting this report will make it possible to revitalise the services sector by asking Member States to accept a reduced rate of VAT of 5 % on labour-intensive services and locally supplied services .
I am satisfied with the version now before us .
it obviously makes it attractive for counterfeiters , if they are going to counterfeit notes , to counterfeit large denomination notes , rather than smaller denomination notes and I am slightly concerned that this very large note will , if you want , make the euro the counterfeiter &apos;s currency of choice .
I shall conclude by emphasising that harmonising the professional qualifications of advisers will contribute to improving the quality of the service in the interest of users , to minimising the risks of accident likely to cause damage to the environment as well as significant damage liable to be harmful to any person who may come into contact with dangerous goods .
written statements ( Rule 149 )
at the end of the negotiations , Parliament accepted the Council ’ s refusal to include the liberalisation of rail passenger services in this directive .
we want to ensure that European taxes are used in a proper manner .
the international community has a duty to seek to understand what may have led to these terrible crimes .
I think that this is the wrong way to change and improve the function of the Structural Funds .
a particularly striking statistic is that the German Society for the Protection of Children believes there are as many as 50 , 000 so-called street children .
in the bullring , there are bulls that will simply not be pacified .
I cannot , of course , discuss all these demands now , but I would like to pick out a few of them .
indeed , in their talks with Putin , most Heads of Government avoid sensitive issues such as the war in Chechnya and observance of human rights .
you only have to think of the work of the Olive Oil Council .
secondly , with regard to the report presented by Mr Nassauer , this text will of course receive at least our qualified support .
it fell .
thirty-two Members support Mr Evans &apos; proposal .
new and divisive structures are not needed .
Thug tú riamh , agus tabharfaidh , tacaíocht láidir d &apos;Institiúid na Parlaiminte ag leibhéal na hEorpa agus ar an stáitse idirnáisiúnta .
we must be able to defend ourselves if companies dump products onto the market , in other words , if they sell products at less than the cost of producing them , in order to force their competitors out of the market and to gain an illegitimate advantage .
adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Member of the Commission . - I would also like to thank the honourable Member for this question .
used in the wrong way it presents many threats , which at worst could lead even to the manipulation of the human genome .
in Europe we are already assisting with all these objectives .
I therefore voted against acceptance of the budget when it came before this Parliament , but I suspect that my reasons were somewhat different to those of most of the other Members of the institution who also voted against it .
this situation leads to human suffering and social tensions .
there must indeed be penalties for illegal discharges .
that is why , although we congratulate and thank the rapporteur , André Brie , on the huge effort he has made , we unfortunately cannot support his report , because it is clear from the foregoing that the report does not face the facts .
Mr President , I too consider Mrs Aelvoet &apos;s report excellent and the agreement with Jordan positive , also because a solution has been found for some problems with agricultural production that were blocking the agreement .
the exploitation of diamonds has a role to play in combating poverty and achieving the Millennium Development Goals .
there are therefore no easy solutions to problems such as industrial pollution - as the rapporteur himself pointed out - or pollution due to high demographic density .
this works well and happens regularly .
unfortunately , expectations were not realised and the disappointment was directly proportional to this .
excise duties on tobacco are a significant source of revenue for the Member States , varying from 0.4 % of GNP to 1.6 % of GNP in Greece , for example .
I hope that you will be able to let us have this information soon .
therefore , with a view to the success of the Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey , the Commission has recommended that the Council increase the volume of Official Development Aid and we suggest that by 2006 all countries whose percentage of aid in relation to GNP is less than the European Union average of 0.33 % , should have reached that level .
in the European Union , we are regulating ourselves to death .
as we all know , croupiers in casinos receive psychological training in order to spot players with addictive behaviour .
in the light of the development of new financial instruments in a globalised world , the Green Paper takes a critical look at the soundness of financial institutions and of the financial system as a whole , and at the regulation and supervision of the system , with a view to preventing any repeat of the crisis in the future .
therefore , Europeans &apos; money would be put to good use ; it would promote development , and not just increase the return on capital invested .
since the Treaty of Lisbon , for the most part the subject of fisheries now falls under the ordinary legislative procedure , whereby Parliament has an important part to play as co-legislator .
now that exhilaration should be tapped to build what is the hardest thing : lasting peace and stability .
the second point is establishing a policy of European solidarity , such as the common European energy policy , which will prove that Europe has profoundly and irreversibly united since the historic year of 1989 .
by condoning large budget deficits in countries such as Germany or France , but coming down heavily on other weaker and poorer countries if they dare to have a deficit , the EU is putting into practice an idea familiar to us from Orwell ’ s ‘ Animal Farm ’ , namely that all men are equal , but some are more equal than others .
it is right and proper that the Commission and the Council have been proactive in seeking to apply the membership terms across the complete island of Cyprus .
.
that will help us to build a coherent approach that can serve as a model for elsewhere .
we extend our warmest welcome to Malta and Cyprus .
I am not sure how determined the Commission is in this respect . Furthermore , the way in which President Santer has just left the Chamber once the vote had gone his way might give us cause for scepticism and anxiety .
this is part of the strategy .
then , of course there is the international dimension .
according to the new procedure , if Parliament were to object to the substance of an implementing measure , the Commission would be prevented from adopting it in that form .
I believe that we should begin the work today , and not before time .
however , I must conclude by saying that there will surely be no need for a third relaunch .
Mr Bardong expounded the PPE group &apos;s view on these issues from a constitutional point of view so well that I will skip that section and simply point out that it would be of value if they are ultimately included within the framework of the Union .
the EU , Council , and Commission have introduced several motions into the agreement , which are causing concern amongst some Members , who are trying primarily to guarantee that security is not at the expense of human rights and fundamental freedoms ; and rightly so .
with regard to trade with our partners in development , the Commission is quite prepared to guarantee that any new arrangement will take account of the ACP countries &apos; special economic and social limitations .
( NL ) First of all , I should like to express my compliments to the Swedish Presidency for the efforts it has undertaken over the past few months .
in Zambia , several women are murdered every week by their men .
please , though , for your own image - and I think that you are strong enough to allow political plurality and human rights defenders in your country - please , release the political prisoners , and , as we have said , please abide by the convention against torture and degrading treatment !
there are two schools of thought regarding these problems ; those who want duties on polluting and those who want insurance .
last but not least , I would like to point out that the victims of these appalling crimes often continue to be victimised , and find themselves in very precarious circumstances , which is the reason for special protection and support .
.
Mr President , I would first of all like to express my appreciation for the sterling work carried out by Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen .
last but not least , is the important role in this report of the 14 paragraphs dedicated to the role of women in human rights , and as Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights and Gender Equality , I would like to celebrate the fact that many of the amendments that we discussed and adopted in committee have been taken on board .
I said that I had read your letter and that my duty was to ensure that reports comply with the Treaties and the Rules .
 
Mr President , I would like to thank all the Members of the European Parliament for their excellent and fruitful cooperation .
we need a common defence system and a coordinated response at European level for possible pandemics , as the topical issue of bird &apos; flu proves .
Conference participants emphasised that environmental policies should be complementary .
in my view , it is just as absurd for the Commission to take Finland to court because measurements have not been carried out there with respect to some beach that everybody knows to be clean , and where the quality of the water is even known to be excellent , just because the definition of a bathing site has these problems associated with it .
the information networks are in full expansion and a massive volume of images and information can travel the airwaves promoting the exchange of knowledge and freedom of expression in countries where it is not guaranteed .
this is a very , very important requirement .
in my own country , Slovakia , an increase in the bark beetle population forced the national park services in the High Tatra region to use pesticides to combat the corrosive nature of the insect .
but I cannot , of course , tell you what the Spanish Government will say .
in 2005 , the Republic of Croatia asked to participate in the activities of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction .
Prime Minister , 50 years after the Treaty of Rome was signed , you have returned Italy to its rightful place at the heart of Europe , and at the heart of the European project .
the best strategy for combating this violence is to take a holistic approach and work from a broad definition of violence against women .
we need the various problems to be dealt with individually , so that a solution can be found for the combination of regional communities , business life and family relations for which the new Schengen border will pose great difficulties in the east , by easing restrictions on a regional basis in border areas .
the external costs for our economy and our environment - air pollution , noise , congestion - are heavy , which also has an adverse effect on transport mobility .
that experience may lead to increased knowledge of various languages and cultures , even in European countries .
we only need effective and , more importantly , immediate action of the Commission on this matter .
dear colleagues , do not forget that this concerns approximately one third of the world &apos;s population .
this position was interpreted in a Commission communication in 1993 .
I would like expressly to address President Cox , because his institutional declaration on behalf of Parliament had an enormous impact in Madrid and in Spain and was a match for the dramatic circumstances we are living through .
there is no need for analysis and immersion in documents to be able to state that this region , compared with Africa , for instance , is treated as a remote province of our continent .
we voted against a good number of the amendments , therefore , since the objective of safer railways will not be achieved via the European Parliament ’ s proposals , since the latter only stipulate minimum standards at European level , preventing Member States from drawing up different national standards without the agreement of the others .
the central aims of this policy are in my view the improvement of the European fleet &apos;s competitiveness together with better safety .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the European Parliament recently celebrated the 50th anniversary of UEFA , the Union of European Football Associations .
in addition , for many European airlines these payments create discriminatory obstacles when it comes to acquiring parts of the previously mentioned Chinese market .
within the framework of the budgetary procedure , even if we opt for a period of five years , Parliament every year has the opportunity to make amendments and to determine payments , i.e. to impose sanctions if it should prove necessary .
as Mrs Schleicher has already indicated , particular attention must be paid to the points on which national parliaments have lost competences which have not been passed on to the European Parliament .
it is therefore quite natural that the European Council should also deal with issues relating to sustainable development and the Kyoto Protocol .
I would add , however , that the protection of children and adolescents against certain abuses must be absolute .
it calls for state terrorism to be stepped up and for democratic rights to be strangled in the name of &apos; combating terrorism &apos; and &apos; radicalisation &apos; .
looking at which camp is in the majority in the Council and knowing that , on 1 January 2007 , Germany will be taking over the Council Presidency , I ask myself what expectations , if any , we can have of mediation under the leadership of the German Council Presidency .
of those employed in the European Parliament , 59 % are women and , at the same time , over 50 % of these women deal with matters of substance .
I think this plan is a really good initiative .
my second preliminary observation is that we have , in the euro , a successful common currency , one that has turned the internal market into a home market , but we do not have a common budget policy .
Mr President , I should first of all like to pay tribute to the rapporteur , who has put forward a very concise and well-presented report and one that we are happy to support .
I should just like to make one comment on electronic payment : the Commission has tried to ensure that for the purposes of the changeover to the euro , European banking federations and associations move ahead with reducing charges for electronic payment . We have not , however , made any headway on this matter .
however , although we should welcome the fact that we can now break through the wall of indifference under international law , we must also ensure that all due precautions are taken to guarantee that military force remains a last resort .
however , overnight it has changed again , and the restrictions in our airspace have been extended until 13.00 today .
I would add , and I would like to stress this point somewhat , that , if we agree to a delay in the introduction of digital tachographs , we leave ourselves open to legal action from those in the relevant professions who are ready .
this is not a statistical issue .
as long as these people are not returned to their home country immediately , without repatriation aid , we will constantly be overwhelmed by waves of economic migrants .
that coincided with a serious discussion concerning a review of the common agricultural policy .
the whole point about democracy – and Iran is very proud of its democracy – is that the voters themselves choose who they want to represent them in parliament .
Russia , as a superpower , however , goes its own way in matters of geography , natural resources , its population and its culture .
in my view , there is no need to be frightened about telling the public what we are doing .
what is more , I am also having to remain abreast of the latest developments in order to be able to communicate by e-mail with my children and grandchildren .
Mr President , I should like to praise the rapporteur most warmly for his excellent work , which is also very interesting from the point of view both of principles and of practice .
attempts to move to what is known as a definitive system have so far failed .
I refer to education , a field that transcends borders , an essential aspect , if we take into consideration the nomadic nature of the Roma people .
these principles include a renewed European social model , based on common shared values , with a sustainable strategy for solidarity and economic and social development .
the same applies to domestic demand and industrial production .
ladies and gentlemen , what is it that Europe needs ?
I think that it is an ideal model and I totally agree that it would be an excellent idea if it were implemented by the other Member States , which is why I think that , initially , it could be used as a best practice between governments , to be adopted initially on a voluntary basis as a pilot project .
equally , the EU should constantly raise awareness on the abolition of the death penalty , both in bilateral negotiations and in international fora .
they both knew that the current EP composition , established by the 2005 Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania , was to be modified , even if that meant going back to the provisions of the Treaty of Nice .
against this background , all the political groups in Burma / Myanmar should be urged to take part in the National Convention charged with drafting a new Constitution . Representatives of the National League for Democracy should also participate .
as the author is not present , Question No 5 lapses .
lastly , no matter what anybody says , the financial perspective is the only game in town .
as such , the final sentence will read :
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , to start with I would like to congratulate Mr Graça Moura on the quality of his work and to thank him for the favourable attention he always paid to our proposals .
climate change , written in the language of floods , droughts and record-breaking temperatures , is only making the situation worse , particularly for the world &apos;s poorest .
that is true .
preparation for European Council ( Göteborg 15 / 16 June 2001 )
what the European Union needs now is not that , but perhaps we should be more ambitious .
an aggravating circumstance is this : for 15 years , the European Court of Auditors has been unable to approve the management by the Commission of these tens of billions of euro .
as far as the PPE Group is concerned , we wish to focus the cohesion policy rather more on the key elements of this EU 2020 strategy , whilst retaining solidarity among all the regions and also Objective 2 , about which the Commissioner spoke so vaguely just now .
Mr President , in our view , the Roadmap represents , at all events , a chance of peace which must be pursued over and above any feelings of like or dislike . It calls , first and foremost , for an end to the conflict , to terrorism , to suicide attacks , to targeted assassinations ; it calls for Israel to withdraw from the occupied territories so that two peoples can coexist in peace within secure borders , with the guarantee of democratic institutions .
all that has to happen is for this information , when necessary , to be immediately communicated to the governments concerned .
the next item is the report ( A4-0315 / 98 ) by Mr Medina Ortega , on behalf of Parliament &apos;s delegation to the Conciliation Committee , on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council Directive on the legal protection of designs ( C4-0467 / 98-00 / 0464 ( COD ) ) .
this might have been going on for 25 years .
the vote will take place tomorrow , Tuesday , 24 March 2009 .
the second matter I want to mention is codification and consolidation .
this imbalance is ruinous for Turkey .
I am quite sure this is a question we will return to later in the procedure .
to provide the security , prosperity and opportunity which our fellow citizens expect government to deliver , we have to work together .
the test ban alone only serves to export the problem as cosmetics tested on animals in countries outside the EU will continue to be sold in the EU .
what remains for us to do ?
I support an overwhelming vote for this resolution and I urge you not to forget the despicable behaviour of those who knowingly caused the tragic loss from tobacco-related diseases of so many lives .
under this compromise text , the Council is obliged to repeal or amend the Solana Decision of August 2000 so that it conforms to the principles of this Regulation .
both of these summits have laid solid foundations for the activities of the countries that will hold the presidency in the future and for increasing the influence of the European Union in those parts of the world .
obstacles to be removed include bureaucratic barriers , problems of grid capacity and inadequate support systems .
this does not mean our work is done of course .
that is why we do not want to accept that amendment .
this part of Africa will not be able to develop without a real improvement in the health of its population .
another example of how the European Union is not doing what it should in the Sahel is the way in which it has washed its hands of seeking a solution to the conflict in Western Sahara .
I am sitting here because the Council is over there .
much has been said about the potential effects of the country of origin principle , but , if we are to be sensitive to the reality , there is much more to it than that .
Mr President , if I can try be helpful to the Commissioner I accept his point about other auxiliary cabin staff , beauticians etc .
a very large part of the work in the Joint ACP-EU Assembly is about human rights and attempting to solve and prevent armed conflicts .
through our assistance we will be keen to foster people-to-people contacts and we will seek maximum flexibility within the limits of our financial rules .
the Liberal Group has always been uneasy , not to say unhappy , about the fact that we have a voluntary agreement between the European Commission and the vehicle industry , but now that we have it , the least we can do is ensure that it is properly monitored .
this will involve working together on the practical implementation of the Joint Declaration on EU-UN Cooperation in Crisis Management signed late in 2003 .
that is the purpose of the only amendment that we as the PSE Group are tabling with regard to the resolution tabled by Mr Daul on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on which Parliament will vote tomorrow .
the European Council , issuing an appeal to the international community to pursue , in all multilateral fora , dialogue and negotiation with a view to building , in Europe and elsewhere , a world of peace , law and tolerance , also emphasised the need to combat any racist and xenophobic drift and to reject any equation of terrorism with the Arab or Muslim world .
how does this fit in with respect for the religious beliefs of many Europeans ?
that is a perfect description of the behaviour during the days immediately following 11 September of at least 100 imam in 100 Mosques or Islamic centres , particularly the famous centre in London .
. Mr President , the budgetary year of 2005 will essentially be characterised by two issues from an agricultural point of view : on the one hand , a European Union of 25 Member States from the beginning of the budget , as the Commissioner has quite rightly said , and , on the other , by the implementation of certain provisions adopted in the reform of the common agricultural policy and which will now enter into force , such as , for example , direct aid to milk producers , or aid for rice without the former penalties , and aid for dried fruits , the quality of durum wheat and energy crops .
what I would like to do in developing on Mr Pomés Ruiz &apos; question is to table one or two other points to you in connection with some of the more detailed aspects of the White Paper and the change in organisation that you have proposed .
this proposal is equally important for both the industry and the consumers .
why do we not go for that instead of making a common EU military force ?
therefore , the possible effects of the Commission ’ s ambitions as regards integration of the financial markets and the regulation and supervision of different scenarios should also be part of the assessment we are asking for .
the study is merely one of several elements that the Commission is considering in looking at various options and their possible consequences .
can easily penetrate living cells .
we do not see these as contradictory but rather as establishing a limit beyond which we do not wish to go .
is the Commission prepared to look at this and make funds available ?
this was recently reaffirmed in the Commission &apos;s communication entitled &apos; A simplified CAP for Europe - a success for all &apos; ; I am responsible for the European Parliament report on this communication , on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament .
the requirement should instead be that people can support themselves by working .
however , for five years the situation has been unsustainable for rice producers , who are facing an increasingly bleak future , as a result of the Everything but Arms decisions and imports of basmati rice , which do not correspond either in terms of their characteristics or their origins .
that will certainly be discussed , and the Commission is free to decide which of the Commissioners will answer it .
these people provide for themselves and their families financially , pay taxes into state coffers and pay social and health insurance .
European companies and banks do invest considerable sums of money in the programme industry , but they tend to invest in America rather than Europe .
clearly it is a natural monopoly and clearly the Court of Justice has given its opinion and nobody intends to change the status quo .
this is something we have been talking about for decades , for as long as there has been a Club of Rome , so let us at last come up with something of some practical use .
13 . Community civil protection mechanism ( vote )
I should like to return to this when I have heard what Mr Friedrich has to say . The Commission is of the opinion that taking the European Central Bank &apos;s proposal as a point of departure , the rotation model may be improved by reducing the maximum number of voting rights on the Governing Council .
I also welcome what the Commissioner has said , and am pleased she is in the Chamber this evening as there is a great deal of common ground between the Commission and Parliament on animal health issues .
tragedies are not fair ; almost always , those who have the least are those who lose the most .
these are all key aspects which will also be taken up as part of our agenda for this week &apos;s Summit .
it is on the issues of peace and security that the leading role played by the African Union is of the greatest importance .
we must succeed in enshrining a binding commitment by Iran to refrain from military use of the potential created by its nuclear programme , and we need unlimited access for the International Atomic Energy Agency to enable it to inspect all of Iran ’ s nuclear facilities .
as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Research , Technological Development and Energy , I would like to highlight the most significant elements of this Community strategy .
it is because we Catalans have not had our own State since Barcelona was taken by the Franco-Spanish armies on 11 September 1714 .
having witnessed the monthly operations of the Eurogroup and ECOFIN , I have to agree with all of you when you call on the Council , and the Eurogroup in particular , to provide more coordination .
my amendment calls upon the Commission to monitor the Member States to see that they carry out the necessary inspections set out in these regulations , because if we are to mount a successful campaign to contain and eradicate tuberculosis and brucellosis , then the proper implementation of these regulations will be essential .
oral explanations of vote
fourthly , and this may be the most important clause of all , this Parliament requests the inclusion of the so-called regional economic integration organization clause , to provide that countries who are members of such organizations - and I am specifically thinking of the countries of the European Union - will not be obliged to extend to non-member countries the favourable treatment reserved for members .
in this regard , I would like to stress the criteria I adopted as rapporteur . Firstly , we need to consider all the autonomous territorial entities which operate within the Member States as a single unit .
this report will address the questions raised in the European Parliament resolution of 2008 .
nevertheless , we must give him the benefit of the doubt on his helpful comments about improving the rule of law , human rights and the fight against corruption - with the EU being more engaged in the strategic partnership and new PCA with what is still the largest country in the world , which now projects renewed confidence due to its mineral-resource-driven trillion-dollar economy .
in its own right , it must contribute to increased prosperity in rural areas .
I want to say that one of the features of the structural funds is partnership .
the Commission can firstly be reproached for having retreated into the triple across-the-board logic of reducing prices , dismantling market management instruments and reducing European financial intervention .
according to both the EC Treaty and the Constitution , we are all equal before the law .
it is useless for the government to appear to be in favour of energy efficiency when the potential savings could be achieved through the labelling of some of these products given that buildings account for 40 % of total energy consumption in the European Union .
the current system allows Members who travel cheaply to keep the difference between the amount actually spent and the flat-rate allowance .
it is a fact that the main priority for 2011 should be to push forward with the economic recovery .
these areas include the adoption of norms for Europass , the European City of Culture , the report on key skills for life-long learning , the European Qualifications Framework , digital libraries and many other areas .
as President of the PSE ’ s women ’ s group , I am aware of the tremendous work that our political family does in this field throughout the European Parliament .
of course these provisions apply only to European Union airlines , but , I am pleased to say , that non-Community carriers are obliged to inform passengers of their conditions when they purchase their tickets .
for the first time in such an aviation agreement , the need to balance market access opportunities with strong social protection has been recognised through a commitment to implementing the provisions of the agreement in a way which does not undermine labour rights .
how the Commission implements the Budget and makes use of its resources for the purposes that we decide on at the end of the preceding financial year deserves proper scrutiny .
in 2002 , 12 800 employees are due to retire , approximately 2 000 workers need to be recruited , which equates to 10 000 job cuts .
we wholeheartedly support the call for Parliament to have a single site , namely Brussels .
the multifunctionality of agriculture must also be recognised and enforced by the World Trade Organisation , and that means that agricultural funding must be based on ecological and social criteria as well . The task is not , and I must make this quite clear , to engage in new forms of agricultural protectionism targeted especially at developing and threshold countries .
this minority has however lived peacefully alongside the Muslim majority for decades .
our efforts must be channelled into encouraging a continuous exchange of information between richer and poorer regions .
thank you , Mr President .
let us make sure that it works .
it makes no sense to promote the authenticity and tradition of European wines whilst at the same time advocating the free entry of concentrated must from third countries .
however , in the final analysis , it remains , to a large degree , within the confines of competitiveness and takes an almost neutral stand on the legal issue .
personally , I am convinced that such referenda would show that there is no support in many Member States for greatly increased central power within the European Union .
we can draw green and red lines on the map and say , ‘ There you are , new roads and railways ! ’ , but the trans-European networks must be funded .
just think , if we had still had codecision and that rule now , in 2030 , thirty years on , we would have had to produce another report on the new requirements on ozone in air .
I hope that they will put this omission right at future summits .
firstly , because no one knows what will happen next in North Africa and , secondly , because it is clear that the situation between Israel and Palestine is being used as a pretext for global terrorism and tension and , in particular , to ignite tension in the Muslim world .
in some countries , much domestic work takes place in the informal economy , under precarious employment conditions and / or as undeclared work .
for example , it suggests that multinationals should develop a sense of responsibility and set up ethical investment committees and should apply a &apos; fair &apos; ( but unspecified ) trade system and an overall trade liberalisation policy .
however , what happened was a disgrace .
the next item is the debate on six motions for a resolution concerning East Timor .
it creates opportunities for social contact and for being together and helps people flourish .
Mr Commissioner , you have six months .
we therefore face the sort of problem that results from greed .
my impression from the reaction is that colleagues would prefer to proceed on that basis .
.
Europe must act as a lever for private capital , an intermediary .
having not allowed these students to train and thereby creating an artificial shortage , we then , of necessity , bring in medical personnel from third countries - even the poorest countries - leaving their own people without medical help and creating a brain drain .
I trust and believe that the 21st century can be the century of the knowledge of history through the image of culture .
Mr Tomlinson . If recital C has been withdrawn there is no further need to discuss it .
the Slovak Government is making a start today on translating words into deeds .
red Cross centres have been shut down and those in need deprived of protection and humanitarian aid .
there is no justification today for backing away from those targets .
my colleague , who will take the floor after me , will explain what measures we need to take .
written Statements ( Rule 142 )
 
it is crucially important for this Intergovernmental Conference to score a hat trick ; that of the power to act , democratic legitimacy and transparency .
yet many areas need reform , even without amending the Treaties .
I support the need for regulation and application methods which guarantee that procedures are transparent , offer potential beneficiaries better access to the Structural Funds and reduce the administrative burden on participants .
similarly , enlargement will also generate additional road transport .
Mr Goebbels , it is already after 12.00 .
written Statements ( Rule 149 )
( PL ) Mr President , I voted against this resolution because Lithuania will be able to deal with the problem on its own .
Mr President , if you wonder why the Chamber is not very full , may I raise with you a real problem of access for Members and visitors at the present time .
it is high time we adopted policy .
as the President-in-Office said , there is no opposition here to the European project .
that would , of course , be contrary to the e-Commerce Directive .
with regard to more practical aspects , let me restate my determination to try to find some way , together with the European Parliament , to have Parliament play an active part in these negotiations .
one can , however , be taken aback by the fact that such commonplaces have to be pointed out 15 years after that Agency was created .
asylum seekers are vulnerable people who require appropriate reception conditions .
all costs added to the value of the order shall be borne by the seller .
in response to this consultation two European social partner organisations acting in the hospital and healthcare sector , the European Hospital and Healthcare Employers &apos; Association and the European Federation of Public Service Unions , negotiated with success a framework agreement in July 2009 .
the date 29 February is printed even though it is not a leap year .
this would mean that companies have access to valuable quota rights , which can be transferred and then paid for .
Mr President , free trade that does not entail any disadvantage for European industry is , of course , an illusion .
I voted for the European Parliament resolution on a revised Framework Agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission for the next parliamentary term as I consider that this agreement is essential to cooperation between the European Parliament and the future European Commission .
the same old neoliberal dogmas are being wheeled out : the reduction of state intervention in the economy , and the creation of an open and competitive market , by destroying public services , by changing labour relations in capital &apos;s favour under the pretext of their &apos; rigidity &apos; , and by doing away with sovereignty and with an independent project for Croatia &apos;s development .
unless all Member States are in favour of strict visa provisions and a rigorous immigration policy aimed at zero immigration , the result can only be the lowest common denominator .
previously , we Social Democrats have tried to start by decoupling production support by 50 % and shifting towards rural policy , nature conservation and animal welfare , in other words , shifting from quantity to quality .
( DE ) In order to master the situation , it is certainly sensible to cooperate at an international level if - and I say this very clearly - this cooperation does not need to be bought with EU financial assistance .
I should like to congratulate Mrs Locatelli on having drafted an excellent report , and to thank Commissioner Potočnik for joining us .
but when it comes to health , the damage cannot normally be made good .
adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
let us not deceive ourselves : behind all the good reasons put forward by one side or the other , this issue will be a political test of the first order for the European Union as far as public opinion is concerned .
I agree with Mr Leinen that the Presidency of the Council , at this stage of debate , would be ill-advised to try to pre-empt results , and would indeed risk doing damage were it to do that .
we shall proceed to the second part of this Question Time , during which Commissioner Barnier will reply .
Mr President , although it would have been better if we had voted at lunchtime , I am happy to go ahead now .
the Chinese were also talking about education , and all this in a huge country like China , which is counting on Europe to help it to preserve its cultural diversity .
the peace process has made good progress since Dayton was signed two years ago .
violence against women , including human trafficking and sexual exploitation , is a serious problem that must be eradicated by any means available to us .
the reports were adopted in committee without any amendments .
we hope Parliament will give its support to this .
that is the prerequisite for the resolution of this conflict .
moving ahead also means facing up to new challenges .
Parliament has played a very active and ambitious role in handling this matter .
approval of Minutes of previous sitting : see Minutes
naturally , it could have done so by replying to our questions .
changes to the climate of the planet , on the other hand , are a global issue .
I think that this would be liable to make the debate a little more open . In any case , if the European Parliament should agree at some point to a new Commission , of which I am a member , I will do everything possible , within my remit , to make these agreements a success and to be present at the sessions of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly .
there is no mention of the interests of Europe or its Member States .
in this respect , I feel that we should welcome the Russian Government &apos;s decision to authorise and finally grant visas to the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance to allow it to have a meeting in Moscow .
I know that I have been a sinner in that regard on a number of occasions : I have tried to take too many bags on and sometimes I have been told by the airline to leave the bag at the steps and it gets put in the hold .
today , the single currency is seen , by many citizens in the euro area , as one of the most positive results of European integration .
under the first part of Amendment No 42 and Amendments Nos 82 and 86 , farmers who have discontinued hop production and have received grubbing-up aid during the reference period would still be entitled to the direct payment .
7 ) that the ambiguous clauses concerning the passerelle and transitional mechanisms be removed ; these , it is proposed , should give Heads of State or Government in the Council the right unanimously to extend the EU ’ s legislative powers at the national parliaments ’ expense and to abandon the right of veto / principle of unanimity in favour of majority decision-making – and this without each country ’ s parliament being required to give its approval .
ever since 1971 , Europe has tried to support and assist developing countries in order to reduce poverty by generating revenue through international trade .
Mr President , the attack on a train , which caused the death of 260 civilians and injured more than 150 people on 10 August in Angola is unacceptable and deplorable , especially since , in the weeks that followed , several buses also came under fatal attack .
we will look at ways of improving patient information on medicines , strengthening the role of patients in public health decision-making and so forth .
European companies are already having their accounts or customer service departments transferred to India or Singapore .
this is also the reason that I - that is , Mr Blokland - have joined in signing the amendment rejecting the Commission proposal .
today and last week , there were dock workers demonstrating outside the Parliament buildings .
as a result , the High Level Group on the Competitiveness of the Agro-Food Industry has just drawn up a set of strategic recommendations .
a balanced policy of , on the one hand , pressure and checks on Iran for the respect of democratic freedoms and human rights and , on the other hand , of incentives to develop relations , is the only effective way of establishing a climate of mutual trust and reversing confrontational outbidding and the unilateral strategic approach to the resolution of regional problems .
but let me be clear : where efforts to find solutions through dialogue do not succeed , the Commission will initiate infringement proceedings against the Member States concerned .
our expenditure is just 0.63 % of GDP , when the Community average is 2.4 % .
and it is not right to say that earnings should be eroded as working time is reduced , because the consequence would be to restrain consumer spending further still and reinforce insecurity .
it is important for Parliament to support the financial dimensions of this collaboration between the Commission and the ILO .
the Council was extremely interested in the report on Afghanistan presented by Parliament and summarised by Mr Brie , and wishes to highlight three specific aspects .
if Srebrenica happened because there was not enough European spirit , then we should do our utmost to help this country embark on the right path .
in compliance with the Commission &apos;s proposal , Member States should therefore be provided with a methodology , common standards , definitions , classifications and accounting rules , which should be put together within a binding framework for each of them .
there are going to be difficult moments , without doubt , after the elections ; there will be uncertainties and we will need to continue to have - as we Europeans have always had - the determination to continue supporting this peace process .
however , that means that , in order to prevent distortion of competition , the rules governing pension contributions should also be standardised , and drivers &apos; pensions should be standardised too .
so I welcome this change and urge all Member States and regions to take full advantage of the new flexibility .
as was stated by Mr Swoboda , in the future much more attention should be paid to further transfers and effective implementation of the acquis communautaire .
if China does not cooperate on this , then we must take action in relation to our trade relations with Beijing and with regard to the Chinese Olympic Games .
because when he was in Belgrade , just after the rigged Yugoslav elections , he managed to get a complaint made and Milosevic had to back down .
quite apart from all that , I want to say how very grateful I am to both rapporteurs for the work they have put in , and that I hope that we will , despite the question as to whether this House should exercise codecision or only be consulted on this issue , head for our goal with concentration and in unity .
however , it is a fragile agreement .
in European domestic policy , greater attention should be paid to the development and implementation of an innovation centre dedicated to the new generation of small-scale energy plants based on nuclear and other technologies .
ladies and gentlemen , please allow me to disagree with those people who do not feel that the measure is timely , effective or proportionate .
however , there is no room for complacency : the task is far from finished .
due to this , the majority of members of the Committee on the Environment approved the reports which are not in line with the Commission &apos;s approach and I welcome , in particular , the fact that the reports are opposed to the advertising of medicinal products .
I have received two motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to Rule 40 ( 5 ) .
do not make them wait any longer than is necessary and let us put into practice this policy that everyone wants .
it is right that aviation should be involved in ETS .
another debate absent from the agenda concerns the attempts to ( re ) impose the so-called &apos; European Constitution &apos; , which has already been rejected .
I refer to the problem of East Jerusalem , that of the refugees and that of the conflict between Israel and Syria .
in such circumstances , the communitarisation of the immigration policy at Amsterdam , giving the Commission a monopoly on initiative after 2004 , would appear to be a serious mistake .
on the one hand , we are talking about a community with a common destiny . If we mean this seriously , then we cannot call , on the other hand , for a Member State to be excluded during the first large or moderate crisis that we have encountered .
in particular , it is not acceptable that the Tribunal refer to the fact that a further charge in the same case is inadmissible owing to the &quot; not guilty &quot; verdict .
in addition , our sports facilities do not always allow young women and women to participate in sport at a convenient time . Services such as childcare are not always available .
the next item is the report by Mr Vittorio Agnoletto on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs on the human rights and democracy clause in European Union agreements ( 2005 / 2057 ( INI ) ) ( A6-0004 / 2006 ) .
I share the rapporteur ’ s concern that the Malagasy Government must take steps to monitor fisheries activities more closely .
Och på svenska : Sverige är alltid välkommen i klubben .
finally , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs Thomsen , on an excellently drafted document .
I am very glad , on behalf of my group too , that at last - in accordance with the wishes of this Parliament - we are more strongly represented as Europeans and I am also glad that this is happening under the Austrian presidency .
 
. the Commission believes that the result of the Premier League media rights auction , which was carried out in compliance with Commission Decision 38173 , will have beneficial effects for English football fans .
lastly I agree with the rapporteur that subsidies to build new ships must be ended as soon as possible .
two years ago , we ran a conference on this subject in Brussels .
at any rate , its political thinking is not clear to us , and the question arises of whether it ever engaged in any .
there is a great deal of cooperation between trade unions in other EU countries , for example Sweden , and independent trade unions in Belarus .
we are being asked once again for non-binding advice on Council framework decisions in a key area of internal security , of judicial and police cooperation , which 25 parliaments are ultimately supposed to transpose into national law .
the Duma voted in favour of restricting the right to information which is tantamount to restricting democracy .
when people get together and have a dialogue they can resolve their differences .
for our part , is it not for us to make clearly known , to both Canada and Quebec , that whatever the choice of the latter , Europe will accompany her on the path she chooses ?
secondly , with regard to SMEs , a point raised in particular by Mrs Thyssen , the Commission will engage in a debate about the accounting requirements for small and medium enterprises in the context of the modernisation of the accounting directives , for which the Commission will officially present a proposal before the summer .
I think , Mr President , that that is unworthy of Parliament .
I would like to point to a fact which Mr Zasada has already stressed in his speech .
that may show willing , but it is not enough .
the most serious thing that has happened is that the negotiations between the ruling party and the opposition parties broke down about a week ago , primarily because of the refusal of the ruling party and the Prime Minister to even discuss a number of issues related to the need for democratic reform .
, . – Mr President , I would like to emphasise an important point as the outcome of the negotiations and , provided there are no objections , I would also like to have this put on record .
by giving the major industrial and financial groups an increasingly free hand , by destroying public services or attacking social protection , the Member States of the European Union are not reducing inequalities : they are entrenching them even deeper .
secondly , what is his view of the implementation of existing humanitarian aid during the humanitarian phase ?
if they were there more often , they would notice that we are currently at the start of the European Cup season , in which we have teams playing against each other in which often just one member at any one time is a member of the national squad .
however , we know already that this acknowledgement will not be enough to prevent the massacre of other innocents in the future .
this sentiment is also shared by the Christian Democratic Appeal as the largest delegation in the largest group .
regrettably , in view of time constraints , I will be unable to deal with all those topics in any detail .
( EL ) Madam President , Commissioner , it has been proven that the most effective way of combating trafficking in human beings is to set an example by imposing strict penalties on traffickers .
this process may take a long time but it is unstoppable and , what is more , desirable .
the amendments by the Committee on Culture and Education do not differ substantially in any way from the foregoing .
the ambitions of China and India will probably push this even further if we do not ultimately make a U-turn .
it is equally clear that we have a responsibility towards the ACP countries , with whom we naturally also have a contractual agreement .
although the rapporteur ’ s intentions have not appeared in the report – the approval of Commission decisions to create a general mechanism for correcting imbalances in the Community ’ s own resources – we must , however , restate our strong opposition to the Commission ’ s intentions and those of the main financial contributors ; after all , you cannot remedy one injustice by committing another .
of course we would also like to know where this waste has gone but we can only ask Greece for those statistics .
the European Union is dependent on energy imports .
thank you , Mr Whitehead , for your excellent report , on which I congratulate you .
not only must these reforms ensure that both countries are able to meet the conditions for membership , but they must also , above all , guarantee that after accession both countries are able to honour their commitments effectively as Member States .
in that context , I am very grateful for the draft report on the human rights clauses prepared so assiduously by the honourable Member , Mr Agnoletto .
the incorporation of computerized communication networks in business is fundamental in an interconnected , open world such as we now live in .
it is true that they are separated by a year but , in terms of reasoning , they are very closely related .
such food will not be specially labelled , since exporters will attempt to smuggle it into the European market .
health has a public utility mission and that is why it must meet a series of criteria such as quality , accessibility , universality and solidarity .
first lesson : the stubbornness of the Commission .
the first remark one is led to make is that this new era has helped to reduce poverty around the world .
I voted in favour of the Brok report on the strategy for future enlargements of the EU in order to reaffirm my belief that no further enlargement will be possible without a new treaty allowing the Union to work with 27 Member States or more , accompanied by an adequate financial framework .
the reform of the Customs Code is a reference framework for future proposals and initiatives by the Commission in this area , and is therefore welcome and necessary .
perhaps we can take that as a reason to hope that the Commission might stir itself into life , which , in view of the fact that time is now running out , is precisely what it needs to do ; many regulations will lapse at the end of the year , and , if we fail to reach agreement , our legal position will be a precarious one .
the proposal is intended to guarantee the safety of marketed products and promote compliance with the obligations of producers and distributors .
a European commitment of that kind would also improve non-military cooperation in the area , aiming gradually to reduce the need for a military presence as reconstruction progresses .
I do not share the opinion of the Council representative that everything went wrong last year .
only by constantly developing scientific knowledge and research into the aspects of certain diseases with environmental parameters shall we be able to develop efficiently the Union strategy and action to protect human health .
it is also a good example of the influence Parliament can have .
we are also asking for action by the government of Pakistan , not least to remove the reservations on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights - which they ratified with a large number of reservations - and we urged this in our recent delegation visit to Pakistan .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this report which we should see it firstly in the overall context of rebuilding fish stocks .
radio Continent ’ s director has , in the meantime , left the country post-haste , himself stating that he has done so in fear of his life .
we support the setting-up of a UN peacekeeping operation and hope that the EU may do all it can to help in supporting the peace process .
we hope that suicide will not also be a criminal offence when it is committed .
last point : in relation to external costs I have two requests .
just as every residential area needs its local supply of everyday things , the bookshop is part of the local supply of intellectual commodities .
we must at least ensure that it is impossible to make changes for the worse at any airport .
I emphasise once again my conviction that the European Parliament must be associated with this process of harmonisation after a careful examination of the legal systems in force at national level .
B5-0446 / 2000 by McKenna , on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group ;
however , if this regulation were to result in the closure of a major industry in that area , the results would be counter-productive and would exacerbate the social and economic problems .
we share the same basic views but the Rapkay report lays emphasis on several points that we shall need to consider very carefully .
Mr Bangemann , could you say why the safety assessments of novel foods are not public ?
the technology for this is of German origin and involves the use of a special engine . Why should we not give it a try ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I must first express my gratitude to the Committee on Budgets , and especially to the rapporteur , Lord Tomlinson , for their painstaking work .
the report therefore seeks initiatives from the Commission to increase the population &apos;s opportunities for further training both within firms and in the education system itself .
we propose that the Commission should have exclusive competence for implementing - I repeat , implementing - European legislation , and , as I said , it will be accountable for this to both Parliament and the Council .
finally , I would like to recall that following the positive developments on the nuclear front , the European Union is currently in the process of resuming talks with the Iranian Government on trade , investment and economic issues .
as someone who comes from a country which has a very long eastern border , that is to say Poland , however , I would like to draw attention to external borders .
governance and partnership are two aspects essential to reviving the market .
the work of reform might also demand additional budgetary proposals , which we urge the Commission to be prepared for .
this increases still further the political significance of the position of our group and of other groups that will vote in favour of these amendments on the grounds that the bridge is economically and environmentally unsustainable .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I speak in favour of Mr Weber &apos;s proposal and I would like to thank Commissioner Barrot , not only for what he has said today in this House , but also for his commitment to resolving , in the best and most constructive way , a situation that in Italy should be recognised for what it is , namely an emergency involving thousands of people .
finally , the report observes , I quote : &apos; that the efficacy of many financed European networks and their contribution to the reduction of social exclusion are not demonstrated at all and have never been evaluated . &apos;
the good news is that Mrs Hieronymi has , of course , carried out sterling work and the cooperation which culminated in unanimity within the committee which handled this report was more than excellent .
Madam President , Commissioner , I would like to say that the majority of governments and citizens only remember the victims of terrorism after a serious attack such as the ones in Madrid , New York or London .
the Legislators Dialogue has gained momentum and has begun to bear fruit .
the Commission cannot therefore accept Amendment No 32 because this would require the tests of the general prohibition to be reapplied to misleading or aggressive practices .
that is why it is of the utmost importance for my group , for example , to know whether the European Commission will , after the failure of social consultation , produce a draft directive on temporary employment .
of course it is good to keep people in their own area , always provided it can be done in decent conditions .
we would certainly see a convergence develop in Europe , but it would be a convergence downwards , towards a situation of major chronic unemployment .
when we talk about customs processing what comes to mind is a negative image of red tape , inefficiency and unnecessary duplication .
closure of sitting
the European Union is the only political level in Europe that is debt free .
and if Ireland is not given a reprimand now , it will be very difficult to criticise the policy of Member States in future .
the Commission welcomes this useful proposal , which embraces the amendments to the Code adopted by the IMO Assembly last November .
they must be used with care , and I believe that this is what will happen in the autumn if the Commission does not live up to its own formulations .
in this respect it is also absolutely vital that we should do our utmost , as soon as possible , to create stronger mechanisms for ensuring that the policies adopted by the Member States and European Union policies are coordinated and complementary .
fundamental human rights and the Universal Declaration of 1948 , the conventions of the ILO ( International Labour Organisation ) or conventions on the environment , are in essence superior to the standards governing trade .
we therefore need a book of rules . We need a Constitution .
at that time we told the Council that our consent to the result of the conciliation process was wholly dependent on our coming together again after two and a half years to consider whether the money would suffice .
that is why the escape clause on the problem of the death penalty is totally inadequate .
I think that this is the way forward .
it has taken into account their opinions , in particular , those of private customers and charities by proposing that a reduced rate be applied to those services such as letterpost , small packages and direct mail which such customers need most .
it is good to see care being taken , by our Committee on Agriculture amongst others , to ensure that our policy is constant and reliable , because the world market has again reached a low point and the fall in value of the pound sterling has hit the British per hectare premiums hard .
at the same time , however , we are also involved with common challenges in our relationships with other countries .
making criminality ethnic is extremely dangerous , as well as the fact that politicians and the mass-media , by the media overlapping of crimes committed by Roma people , promote the idea that all criminals come from the Roma population .
as far as the ECHO case is concerned , we have to take it that this affair could assume even greater proportions , but there is not even any information available on the events relating to 1997 - and it is the 1997 financial year that we are dealing with here .
it is therefore a purely commercial approach and focuses on the infrastructure .
it is only by action at the EU level that we can take action against false food scares and bring reality to bear .
I would therefore like to use my speech to make a call for the review of the entire VAT system , which I think would be in the interests both of our economies and of our businesses .
thanks to the document which has been adopted today , relations will be strengthened between old , new and possible future EU Member States , on the one hand , and Central Europe and the Black Sea Region , on the other .
I would therefore urge , finally , that the proposals which the Commission is shortly to submit should be actively taken forward .
it was in Cairo that the United States Secretary of State made an important statement on 22 June at the American University , where she declared that , in the Middle East , democracy was better than stability , overturning – as she put it – 60 years of American policy .
7 . Communication infrastructure for the Schengen Information System environment ( decision ) ( vote )
first , we must reject any increase in the quota beyond 2 , 300 , 000 tonnes ; secondly , we must maintain a tariff quota capable of guaranteeing a minimum price ; and thirdly , we must retain the present split which grants 30 % of the quota to Community and ACP banana operators , 66.5 % to the dollar zone operators and 3.5 % to the Latin American newcomers .
then there is the question of the so-called returnees .
in the mountains , there are areas which have priorities common to us all .
more Europe means playing our proper role in regional stabilisation and promoting the economic development of our neighbouring areas .
many companies are too small to set up works councils or are so large that relationships are not even forged and employee representatives become roving ambassadors .
this is something we must all respect .
we must work to create a pluralistic world that keeps its aptitude for creation intact and that can give rise to the new and to diversity .
the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 13 .
we are not in any sense called upon to form a judgment on the truth or falsity of these allegations or on Mrs Jeggle &apos;s conduct .
on behalf of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party , I should like to say that we approve of this Agreement .
the brain drain .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
governments can also gain experience with sinks .
in particular I would call on Members to remind your political colleagues in your own Member States of the need to put more efforts and resources into ensuring that the Community provisions on animal welfare are complied with .
the use of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment is a major problem for public health , for the environment and for waste management .
our aim is clear - and I know that it is the Commission &apos;s aim as well - and it is that all countries should have implemented the directive by 28 December 2009 .
a &quot; yes &quot; vote should be for keeping the text and a &quot; no &quot; vote should be against the text surely ?
the reason why I ask the question is that there is great hesitancy with regard to EMU all across Europe , and that worries me .
we must also bear in mind that the original directive did not stipulate the length of a working day ( it stipulated a working week of 48 hours - an implied violation of the measure ) .
two years ago I had the honour of representing the European Parliament at the Euro-African Conference in Rabat .
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for finding a balanced position .
on that issue , we have been rather anxious since Monday , since your president , Mr Barroso , made his statements asserting that the environment and the strategies related to it are too costly .
for example - and these too are figures from confirmed sources - human traffickers alone launder some EUR 1.1 billion from their work , namely getting illegal immigrants over the border , and some EUR 51 billion are laundered in the European Union from drug dealing in eastern Europe every year .
Prague is strategically placed in the heart of Europe and the building suggested for the new headquarters currently houses the Ministry of Informatics in the former military zone in Klecany .
yet it was John Lennon himself who added , &apos; You may say I &apos;m a dreamer &apos; .
it will take a bit more than that to convince people .
may I also thank Commissioner Špidla for being here today in place of Commissioner Figeľ , who is travelling outside Europe .
in other words , I agree with what Mr Nassauer said : the fact that we have abolished our internal borders does not mean that our external borders can be left unprotected .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , however attached we may be to harmony between nations , we do not underrate the common European good .
we wish you much luck and success in your task .
a number of very interesting proposals have been made here .
the inequality between the inhabitants of the old and the new Member States is all too apparent .
Europe , its countries , our economies , have always worked better when they have opened up to the world and , now that the global economy is undergoing an unprecedented expansion , Europe and its citizens have much to gain from this opening up of our borders and the increased integration of our economies at global level .
the perpetrators can be certain that they will not find a safe haven anywhere in Europe .
the budget amounts should at least be based on realistic expectations .
– Mr President , the Austrian People ’ s Party delegation voted ‘ yes ’ to the first part of paragraph 69 , on the grounds that we see this as a process with an open outcome , whilst rejecting the second part on the grounds that it contradicts the first .
the EU must help them to overcome the results of many years of negativity created by the presence of the large EU states and the US in neighbouring Afghanistan .
the fact is that existing practice has not been particularly satisfactory , with approaches having been taken that do not protect the consumer , and something must be done about that .
this is , I think , how you should look at it anyway .
now Mr Blair wants to embroil the British nation in yet another lie and fantasy .
it is these aspects that have such a great part to play in the Budget , and especially in the balance sheet , but the budget-spending centres must be able to get more information from the accounts .
it is more than that .
I , for my part , appreciate that the Committee on Petitions and its cooperation with the ombudsman and his services needs to be galvanised into greater action , given that , according to the initial data , there has been an increase in petitions in the order of 40 % compared with the previous year .
many of them – and this is particularly unpalatable – come from the political formations which once were not put out in any way by communism , and which were accommodating and tolerant to the regimes that occupied half our continent for a great many years .
in addition - since Mr Deprez is here , I can say this before the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs - I kept the Bureau and coordinators informed .
but this new partnership must also be aware of the people &apos;s needs .
the democratic deficit of the European Union still goes by the same name - the Council .
do we not realise how much not having a Minister of Foreign Affairs has cost us over the years ?
the discussions in Luxembourg gave us a prior taste of this difficulty .
I would stress that the treaty also opens up the possibility of taking specific measures in the professional field that can be a particular stimulus for a group that is discriminated against or under-represented . So positive action indeed .
what are the advantages of this directive ?
it is its responsibility , as stated in Article 274 , to implement and oversee the Community &apos;s budget .
the report itself , as is only right and proper , makes demands for an increase in economic and social cohesion in line with territorial cohesion , so that every citizen of the EU will be able to rely on the best possible state and political structures in making a success or his or her own life .
I believe that a European identity and culture must be built on the basis of dialogue and contact with cultures other than those that have in recent years promoted and paved the way for the dissemination and the growth of a European idea , a European culture .
I have been aware of this in Turkey since 1995 .
however , we are categorically opposed to the derogations put forward in the report , since these essentially allow for the circumvention of these provisions through the possibility of exemptions and waivers provided for in Article 3 , which the report unfortunately accepts .
firstly , that it really is a question of minimum standards .
in particular , I do not think we can avoid the idea of a federation between Kosovo and Albania , nor can we avoid associations between certain parts of Bosnia and Serbia .
similarly , and even if it understands the reasons that may lie behind them , the Commission cannot accept Amendment 18 in favour of rejecting the common position , Amendments 21 and 24 that exclude , in particular , taking account of particularly vulnerable risk groups or the effects of interaction with photosensitive substances , and the full range of Amendments 19 to 23 and 25 to 33 which exclude optical radiation from natural sources from the scope of the directive .
the agreement sets a time of 5 minutes .
as I see it , two things take precedence in all these dossiers : maximum consumer protection and complete transparency .
direct criticism pertaining to special situations should not get lost in multilateral declarations .
the next item is the debate on the following six motions for resolutions on Venezuela :
to this end , I would like to highlight the clause on the designation included in the Agreement which is aimed at giving all EU air carriers non-discriminatory access to routes between the EU and Vietnam , but also the provisions relating to security and compliance with competition rules .
in this way , we shall avoid the bad experiences of the past , by which I mean the amount of time taken to adopt programmes , the consequence of which is failure on the part of the European Commission to prepare proposals for the submission of tenders and for civil society to participate and respond to the European Commission &apos;s proposals in time .
for example , they must receive a separate state aid package so that they form a bridge in the EU with regions such as the Eastern Mediterranean .
I shall not go into the question of exceptions here .
in ending I want to assure you that our first responsibility is to our European consumers and that we want a just and fair deal for everybody .
I support the Environment Committee &apos;s retabled amendments , in particular the specific reference to the precautionary principle , to market monitoring and the European product safety network .
the impact of a duty on the price of such shoes is therefore potentially greater than it is for ordinary shoes .
beyond that , on humanitarian aid , a joint conference is being organized by Commissioner Bonino and the Overseas Development Institute in London , at which I shall be speaking about the ethics underpinning our humanitarian aid .
the thorough discussions within and between institutions show that this procedure is living up to expectations .
we have to subject the matter to the Johannesburg check that Mrs Corbey has mentioned .
( DE ) Mr President , that your words have been received with approval and warmth is obvious from the applause .
I must thank you for highlighting the important role of the Commission &apos;s recommendations in the spring on the dual display of prices , banking charges and the monitoring of the euro &apos;s introduction .
on a broader budgetary matter , I welcome the fact that under the 2004 budget Parliament &apos;s Committee on Budgets supports the following measures : the need to increase rural development aid measures under the EU common agricultural policy ; the need to guarantee the safety of food products , both from within the territories of the Union and from third countries ; greater co-ordination of security measures at the EU &apos;s external borders and improved EU immigration and asylum policies ; and promotion of an EU media space to disseminate information on the workings of the European Union and raise public awareness of the impact of European Union legislation on the day-to-day lives of the citizens of Europe .
Mr Barrot , we have here a twisted codecision procedure .
the value of these services is clear , it is assessed and added to other data concerning sales of financial sector products .
fourthly , we need high-quality childcare and a child-friendly environment , no matter what the parents &apos; income .
at the same time , we voted against the European Parliament ’ s call to shift Swedish opinion in favour of Swedish participation in EMU and of a transition to the euro .
this strikes me as extremely important , provided this does not simply look into the extent to which the current situation at the start of the negotiations about other chapters can be maintained as much as possible .
thank you , Mr Posselt .
that is why I find it almost incomprehensible that the action plan was adopted before Parliament had expressed its views on it .
in order to promote the application of satisfactory maritime regulations , the Commission actively supports and promotes the work of the International Labour Office in the process of consolidating all the agreements on international maritime regulations , with a view to adopting a single agreement to which I believe the Community should be a contracting party .
I believe we must be pleased that this agreement has been concluded with a country such as Chile , since in a way this agreement is a recognition of the great civil maturity of the citizens of that country and their decisive desire for openness and trade .
an active policy should be adopted in order to remove them from those estates , if possible with the help of European funding .
we must state very loudly that establishing the maximum possible harmonisation across the Member States would reduce the protection of many consumers , since in many countries there is a greater tradition of protecting consumer rights .
as I see that I am very well within my time , may I add that the coming ratification of the European Constitution , despite its rejection in two referendums , is undemocratic , cowardly and illegitimate .
tomorrow , this Parliament will mobilise itself by means of an information campaign and a meeting of its Committee on Development , which will hold a debate with carriers of the virus and agents working on the ground .
indeed , there are many women pensioners who receive a pension which is an eighth of the size of their husband &apos;s pension , of a man &apos;s pension , for there is a particular law of the Italian Republic which lays down that if a woman has worked for fewer years than her husband she is to receive a pension which is much , much lower than EUR 100 per month and , indeed , is very often no greater than EUR 25 per month .
it is right for inspections to be carried out on feedingstuffs and so you must vote for the motion &apos; .
is it possible to protect an animal which we are going to kill ?
in other words , nothing is agreed until everything is agreed .
in fact , quite contrary to the statements made in the resolution and during the debate , there is still a serious risk that the Charter , if incorporated into the Treaties and given legal value , will be immediately appropriated in the most imprudent way by a militant and fired-up minority . Next , it will be thrown off course , so as to effectively limit the competences of the Member States to a very considerable degree , precisely where the central core of the sovereignty and self-determination of their peoples are concerned , tending to superimpose itself on the systems of fundamental rights of the Member States and to subordinate them entirely .
as always , we are working closely with Parliament to prepare for the Cancun conference .
therefore I voted in favour , with certain reservations .
we warmly welcome the fact that some of the proposals we tabled were adopted , which were as follows :
in the interests of completeness I should say that this is a matter on which the European Commission has the right of initiative and that if the European Commission feels either that the labour market is no longer responding to the rules in force or that there are serious problems concerning this question of the principles of non-discrimination , I think the European Commission will not hesitate to use its right of initiative .
- Before the vote
this is confirmed in the new regulatory framework for the Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund and in the Commission &apos;s related guidelines .
to press for closure in those circumstances raises considerable resentment .
however , for the roll-call vote it seems to me that the figures are male only , and given that there are ladies voting too I would ask that the images be adjusted to reflect reality .
with no source of funding , this strategy has no credibility .
when a new President was brought in , Israel said it could not deal with him , it could not negotiate with him and they were backed up all the time by the Americans and by certain Member States of the European Union .
we feel further work should be done in that area .
with that abstention , we intend to indicate the following .
the intention is to reduce aircraft noise at European level and to prescribe the same noise standards around busy airports in order to protect our citizens .
at the same time , the EU will be able to defend its position before the European Court of Human Rights .
Mr Brok &apos;s report outlines proposals for fundamentally changing the European Union &apos;s institutions , an idea which has been gathering support over recent years .
I do have serious concerns in that area .
– Mr President , having congratulated the rapporteur , Mrs Saïfi , I would like to note for the Commission &apos;s benefit specific points of dialogue , agreement and / or disagreement with regard to the strategically important European textile and clothing sector .
our warm appreciation and thanks to the rapporteur .
.
previously , when these funds were used to invest here and there , particularly in the United States , their strategic character was called into question .
Mr President , a feature of the current situation is the anger and the frustration of the men and women of all our Member States .
when Mr Gollnisch comes to speak , I shall give him the six minutes which he could have given you before , but which he cannot give you now .
Parliament shall be duly involved in the European Semester , in order to increase transparency , ownership and accountability of the decisions taken , specifically through economic dialogue .
the main way to achieve this with vans is to modify the engine and mechanics of the vehicle , which is a far longer and more costly process than a simple change to the bodywork .
for half a century this great adventure has continued in spite of countless difficulties .
despite their low prevalence the number of patients in the EU with these diseases is relatively high , and joint action is therefore necessary at an EU level .
the separation wall will not solve the problem .
hence the need to regulate prices .
( RO ) Mr President , as a member of the Delegation for relations with the Pan-African Parliament , I firmly believe that the European Union , and Lady Ashton in particular , should take a strong stand against the actions of the Mugabe regime involving the intimidation and harassment of human rights activists , and encourage respect for public rights and freedoms , including the freedom of expression and assembly , which Zimbabwe has formally committed to at a global level .
the next item is the report ( A5-0357 / 2000 ) tabled by Mr Parish , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on the situation and perspectives of young farmers in the European Union &#91; 2000 / 2011 ( INI ) &#93; .
personally , I believe that the inclusion in the sectoral directive of a provision going beyond the scope of the GATT Agreement could constitute grounds for complaints to the WTO panel .
they know what they are voting for .
the Lisbon Process is , of course , about best practice , and that means that we are supposed to look to those countries that have made most progress .
amendment No 21 can be accepted .
once again , hidden behind the great plans and fine speeches lie quibbling , horse-trading , undeclared aims and financial designs .
these are significant results , and prove that a European perspective acts as a driving force for the preparations of a country .
that is most regrettable .
perhaps it is because it is three years since the death of Hrant Dink , and there are still serious questions still to be answered in relation to that crime .
that is what we need .
we are calling upon the United Nations to assume full responsibility for a humanitarian action in Albania , instead of contracting it out to Italy , and we urge that the military support for the mission should , most especially , not be Italian .
we also need a firm commitment from the Commission that it will not reduce the trade policy measures it is proposing to put a stop to unfair competition , and to high duties , peak tariffs and non-tariff barriers which make market access so difficult .
each country will be obliged to draw up its own plan following the guidelines defined in the Directive .
I think that they can fulfil their role much better if they enjoy a uniform political and legal status based on European law .
now you can go from Vitoria to Copenhagen in 2 or 3 hours by plane .
I am , in fact , convinced that in the medium term , the Kyoto Protocol will make the European economy more competitive as a result of the technological transformation that we will achieve earlier than elsewhere in the world .
on the question raised by Mr Chountis , what I can say is that when the directive is in place we will provide a clear legal framework regarding rights to reimbursement for cross-border health care .
this EU law exists to enable citizens to go home and get the claim settled quickly and easily in their own language .
Parliament split virtually 50 / 50 on a strategic matter during the first reading - this for the first time , as I should like to remind you - and a blocking minority , although indeed a minority when all is said and done , imposed its view upon the majority in cutting ECU 1 billion from the structural funds - in the payment appropriations of course - in the programmes for industrial restructuring and the reduction of unemployment .
thank you very much , Mrs Bonino .
several governments , organisations , in particular HELCOM ( the Helsinki Commission ) , and other players are working to rescue the marine environment of the Baltic Sea .
the Commission states , however , that Poland is the worst culprit of all .
turning to Mr Jarzembowski ’ s report , it should be noted that it falls into two parts .
we are very pleased that Finland is of interest as a destination .
but I also believe that in future we will have to make the universal service sufficiently attractive .
I welcome the rapporteur &apos;s effort to make consumer rights more transparent .
the Commission justifies change in terms of the state of the art in technology and science .
the compromise on nickel-cadmium is realistic giving a four-year breathing space before a full ban would be introduced .
in 2009 , the European Social Fund has almost EUR 11 billion available in resources for payments .
I would hereby also like to thank all of the rapporteurs for their conclusions and you , Mr President , for the time .
dialogue with Africa is necessary , but should not overlook grievances .
we understand the difficulties of the democratic Serbian Government .
on 2 April 2009 the European Parliament voted in favour of the Commission &apos;s proposal under the consultation procedure , and discussions on the draft directive are ongoing in the Council .
hops are traded freely throughout the world , according to the principle of supply and demand .
in writing . - ( LT ) I voted in favour of this report and endorsed the European Parliament &apos;s decision to grant discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Food Safety Authority for the financial year 2009 .
do you think , Commissioner , that a strong institution merging the regulatory authorities - such as , for example , as in Holland , where the competition authority has taken over the energy regulatory authority and the telecommunications authority - would be a good model for other Member States as well ?
as far as we are concerned , the dates which he has set out are the latest possible deadlines for initiating a new legislative procedure .
only yesterday , as you have heard , a kangaroo court in Tehran called for the death penalty against five protesters arrested during the Ashura riots on 27 December .
the Member States have been encouraged , and have agreed , to include this theme as appropriate within their communication activities for the year .
as regards SMEs , we must create a competitive regulatory environment and help our businesses to gain a better foothold in international markets .
Mrs Dobolyi , you have failed to respond to an emphatic question that I have put to you three times now .
furthermore , the proposals mean that the European Parliament will decide throughout this period - 2000-2006 - on some EUR 20 billion less of non-compulsory expenditure than this Article 203 would permit and , in addition , it could do this or would do this in a new context without restrictions in terms of Article 203 .
according to the description of this Treaty laid before the Swedish public , a unanimous decision by the Council of Ministers would be necessary to amend the import rules governing alcohol .
we are opposed to extending the list of exceptions ; some of the contentious points can perhaps be resolved between the parties , because we too are keen to find a satisfactory solution which we can all live with .
this proposal concerned the content of the report which lobbyists are obliged to submit each year to renew their pass cards : it contains details of their lobbying of decision-makers in Parliament .
in fact , contract law determines and organises transactions within the Internal Market , so its potential for both hindering and facilitating those transactions is therefore obvious .
this will make safety belt systems compulsory in cars up to 3.5 tons .
some of the syrup , too , ended up with soft drink manufacturers .
before I raise some questions , I feel it is only right and proper to confirm before the European Union body which is fully representative of the citizens that Commissioner Lamy and Commissioner Fischler - who are to speak after me - have always fully adhered with wisdom and flexibility to the mandate given to them by the European Council , which is , moreover , mirrored to a large extent in the demands contained in your resolution .
I would like to know what the logic is of convening a group of experts once the directive has already been adopted .
( Loud applause )
it is therefore a case of providing a framework and opportunities for European political parties to carry out at European level the functions that they have been carrying out in the national arena .
as you know , the House will discuss the Boogerd-Quaak report on the EC-USA agreement on PNR issues tomorrow evening .
on behalf of the UEN Group . - Mr President , I would like to thank President-in-Office Dimitrij Rupel and Commissioner Verheugen for their introduction to this debate .
although the Basle II rules have only been fully implemented as of 1 January 2008 further improvements have already been planned in the capital requirements directive .
many countries such as Italy have a corporative system for regulating the professions , which makes access impossible since the partners would be bound to the corporations and creates a legislative barrier to mobility , for example to access in Italy for those who wish to exercise some of the most important liberal professions .
 
we will be addressing climate issues at the summit and discussing them with President Bush .
the call for a European Youth Guarantee , whereby young people , after a maximum period of four months &apos; unemployment , are to be offered a job , an apprenticeship or other training opportunity , is an interesting proposal that we need to look at in more detail .
the category of priority projects encompasses a range of energy network projects with quite a significant impact on the completion of the internal market and which are designed to improve the security of supply .
their hopes are also awakened by our partnership agreements with the human rights clauses .
why not create a dialogue prize in Parliament , like the Sakharov prize for human rights ?
( the President cut the speaker off )
I hope that this will also , slowly but surely , dawn on politicians in Turkey .
I would like to refer to these challenges .
after emergency aid , our focus should gradually turn to the long-term development of Haiti .
it should be coordinated by the key economic actors , in particular , the G20 .
four years have now elapsed since , as Commissioner , I began work on cooperation in justice and home affairs , and a clear pattern has now emerged .
the procedure will also allow us to produce a draft resolution setting out our concerns on the agreement in issue - in this case , Mauritania - with the request that they be taken on board by the negotiators and ultimately become part of the final Protocol .
Internet activities and everything that goes with the New Economy are still not the brave new world so far as women are concerned , as , incidentally , was also noted recently at a major international conference in Hamburg .
during the Committee stage , my amendment rejecting the idea that resolution of the Cyprus question is to be achieved through unilateral action by Turkey was not accepted .
finally , Mr President , my personal conviction is that , if we do not want liberalisation to give rise to distortions in competition and the flight of capital to more beneficial climates inside and outside the Union , the correct operation of the market in financial services will not be possible without a certain degree of approximation of the laws which regulate savings .
Ripoll y Martinez de Bedoya report ( A5-0140 / 2000 )
ultimately , it is to blame for what happens to it .
with regard to specific results , the renewal of the agreement will allow the continued exchange of information on science and technology policies between the EU and Ukraine .
it is perceived as a just cause , and the younger generations are no exception to this .
this often puts them in a worse position in pending cases at national level , and so rather more transparency is called for here .
the very fact that the Netherlands is accustomed to trying to reach compromises and consensus could make this Dutch presidency an historic one .
– Perhaps the most complex , controversial and fascinating aspect of the challenge of constitutionalising Europe is that of external action .
Mr Nordmann - I congratulate him on his report - is correct to cite the need to tighten fraud detection systems in the countries of origin .
it was mentioned that we need to modernise the energy sector .
Mrs Breyer , in this kind of debate , even the omissions are respected .
I think that without the rapporteur present we cannot continue the debate , so I am asking you to give me permission to close the debate today .
co-development money must reach the people directly , without being misappropriated .
ladies and gentlemen , the resolution that we are tabling and debating today , and which we will vote on tomorrow , which I represent on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament , demands that all prisoners of conscience in Cuba be freed .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , in the present case we are dealing not only with equal treatment between men and women in the staff regulations of officials of the European Communities , but also , as Mr Casini has just explained so impressively , with the removal of discrimination of any kind on grounds of sexual , religious or philosophical orientation , in other words , exactly as set out in Amendments Nos 3 , 8 and 11 .
we do not want to help bring about a situation in which voting in this House is on the basis of the private opinions or moral views of individual Commissioners .
today I will not fail to express my respect for the Commission under President Jacques Santer for having the courage and the staying-power to uncover , in the face of resistance in the Member States , the scandalous abuses whose origins after all reach back to the mid-1980s .
we know that many Member States do not want guidelines .
I would like to endorse and stress my total support for what my colleague Mrs Miguélez said here , to the effect that it is essential to favour traditional fishing methods .
it will then become more attractive to combine several modes , for instance with part of the journey being done by rail and the freight then continuing by boat .
such integration would make it possible , for example , for the equipment to be type-approved .
the administrative behaviour of the Ombudsman &apos;s own office perhaps provides a useful example of the kind of practices which should be included in a code .
after all , the charter must be able to form the basis for new fundamental rights if so necessitated by social developments .
today there are more of them in existence . There are two in the United Kingdom and seven in Sweden ( three in Karolinska and four in Gothenburg ) , but they appeared after 27 June 2002 .
I once heard from an official at the Commission that there had not been any really specific discussions with the individual countries .
these provisions oblige the Member States to create DNA files and permit the collection , processing and automated exchange of DNA data , fingerprints and other records and information by the repressive mechanisms , including on persons who they suspect will commit a criminal offence or jeopardise public order and security .
I hope that I will also help your G8 presidency for the goals for Africa and our solidarity .
finally , we live in challenging and uncertain times and the political situation in the Middle East is very volatile .
he claims that , because Commission staffing has been reduced to some 40 % of its 1992 levels , this indicates much lower priority within the Commission .
that freedom of movement for workers is enshrined in the Treaty but in practice a mass of real practical difficulties stand in the way of its proper realization .
Mr President , I should like on behalf of my Group to voice our serious concern at the current situation in the Western Sahara to the European Parliament and , more importantly , the Commission and the Council .
on Mrs Hautala &apos; s point , I would simply say that none of the appointments that have been announced today was the subject of a panel and there is a very straightforward legal reason for that .
( DE ) Mr President , one thing has not yet been properly appreciated here today and that is the fact that the positive referendum in Ireland was hardly the first positive referendum relating to the constitutional process that Mr Verhofstadt mentioned .
is there a case for asking why &apos; dialogue &apos; was not advocated in Libya , rather than bombing ?
I think that either that has to be corrected in the German or that you have on several occasions said that there will be a roll call instead of an electronic vote .
there must be no more of the assertions we have occasionally heard in the debate on structural policy that two and two can make five .
the solution to this is also very positive , making it possible to provide a reasonable level of financing for projects included in the trans-European networks .
by approving these amendments , the House will be taking account of public health concerns while respecting the dignity of the human being , and will bring credit upon itself for responding to the expectations of patients and their families while respecting the rules of biomedical ethics .
firstly and fundamentally , the main point of my report is to emphasise that the European States cannot just extend the repressive aspect of the asylum and immigration policy , while , at the same time , neglecting whole sections of it regarding legal immigration and the integration of nationals from developing countries who have legally settled in our countries .
Yemen has thus found itself in the spotlight of the fight against terrorism and is therefore another country in which the presence of radical Islamists is an unfortunate consequence of past US policy failings .
.
I should like to inform the House that because we are running behind schedule I expect to be in a position to call on the President-in-Office of the Council to respond to the debate at around 12.45 p.m. or 12.50 p.m.
my third point is that it is not only about quantity but also about quality .
thank you very much , Commissioner .
clearly , it is not enough for the European Parliament that its minorities , especially the non-attached Members , should be victims of outrageous discrimination as regards Parliamentarians ’ rights ; we have to go further and punish them , even punish them financially , if the majority considers their behaviour ‘ politically incorrect ’ .
we should show what the European Union has already achieved , and we should ensure that all the information is made available on VDUs , on the Internet , on multimedia , for young people , the elderly , in fact anyone interested , in the form of &apos; Infotainment &apos; .
the latter dispute was only resolved in June 2000 after the loss of some 70 000 lives .
however , because of the considerable differences in gas and energy markets I would be in favour of the rapporteur &apos;s proposal that these sectors be regulated separately .
( ET ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Czech Presidency began one month ago , but it has already managed to spit in our faces and insult us with its gift : Estonia is covered with a hammer and sickle , there is a drunken man on the floor of a Finnish sauna , Germany has a swastika , Italy has football players holding balls near their genitals , Bulgaria is covered with toilets , etc. etc . This is how the artist who made the Czech Republic &apos;s gift to the European Union portrayed the nations and countries of the European Union in his work .
the FSA in the United Kingdom has a rule book of half a million words .
what if it contained some outrageous things that would not be acceptable to this Parliament representing the citizens ?
thanks to him and to the new majority , I think Europe , the European Union , will be able to make a new start with Macedonia .
Mr President , I would just like to say that the rapporteur , Mr Skinner , is being very unsporting .
now we know more than we did then , for the world of science has also provided some answers and clarified the main issues somewhat .
I can promise that we will provide information on the implementation and functioning of the EDF , and of course discussion of this theme in the Joint Assembly is to be welcomed . All the more so since in launching the Cotonou Agreement and the preparatory work for the country strategy papers for the 9th European Development Fund activities we have reached out and included parliaments and public in our ACP partner countries in a way that intentionally raises expectations .
Mr President , I asked the Commissioner a very specific question , and I do not believe I received a reply .
however , whereas some of our international partners are already making extensive use of the many resources offered by CCIs , the European Union has not yet developed a strategy based on cultural activities .
the Bank has to learn to operate within the same spirit .
we now have to apply and defend the choices we have made and are making - which are contained in the Europe 2020 document - with a strong effort to apply the political choices that we have made .
secondly , we want , in addition to the 2006 fixed stage , tax incentives for the early placing on the market of low-emission vehicles and for the retrofitting of older vehicles where that is technically possible and without discrimination against their owners .
we will succeed by means of the Stockholm Programme , which is a five year work programme .
on behalf of the EFD Group . - Madam President , I believe it is madness for this European Parliament to approve the 2009 EU budget when financial irregularities or possible fraud affect between 2 % and more than 5 % of the total .
never before were women so well educated , but , when it comes to entrepreneurship , women are still largely under-represented .
Mr President , the previous speaker has already mentioned some of the details of this resolution .
I understand the President of the Federal Reserve appears before the American Congress every fortnight .
how are the preparations for the Stability Pact budget coming along ?
the Commission will also provide for the mutual recognition of protection measures , which will benefit especially victims suffering repeated violence from a spouse , partner or member of their close family .
thank you to the rapporteur , Mr Guidoni , for his strong support for the Commission &apos;s proposal .
the report suggests that strict deadlines should be introduced for the notification , recognition and implementation procedures .
I therefore voted in favour of the report &apos;s recommendations .
we are ready to share our ideas with you .
we have to decide as a European Union what we mean by sustainable economic growth and it is not what we are voting about here .
the Council should not be rushed into decisions that will not solve deep-rooted problems of such financing and we should not let this procedure distract us from getting the right solution to Agenda 2000 .
the next item is the report ( A5-0165 / 2001 ) by Mr von Wogau , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the Commission &apos;s recommendation for the broad guidelines of the economic policies of the Member States and the Community in 2001 &#91; COM ( 2001 ) 224 - C5-0169 / 2001 - 2001 / 2081 ( COS ) &#93; .
last year I visited the Kurdish refugee camps in southern Italy , and almost all of those to whom I spoke - Kurds from Sri Lanka and from Pakistan - told me how many millions of lire they had paid to middle-men to be brought to Italy , from where they would set off for Germany or the Netherlands .
it is not a problem for us Danes that the Conservatives have nothing to do in England , but are acting the fool in Denmark .
I am therefore delighted with your clear and unequivocal support on this point .
our group welcomes this as a very positive development that should be extended further , which is not to say , of course , that we should not be glad to see environmentally-friendly forms of transport taking a greater share of the market .
if , however , this commitment is to be useful to the people concerned , we must rationalise our aid , reorganise our services and depend to a greater extent on local players , and I am thinking particularly of NGOs .
the exclusion of the public and the secrecy do not increase at all the credibility of the European Union .
as you know , since the meeting of Heads of State and of Government in Essen in December 1994 , Europe has given priority to investment in professional training , which was confirmed in the preamble to the Treaty of Amsterdam .
– First , let me say how very grateful I am for the precision of your answers , which is a breath of fresh air .
I consider the provision of external aid very important and I welcome the Council &apos;s 23 May 2011 decision to allocate EUR 200 million to development cooperation in South Sudan , with the aim of contributing to the autonomy of local communities , and of attending to the basic needs of the people and to the non-existence of human resources and infrastructure .
this report ignores the fact that , at the current rate of progress , the Lisbon objectives will not be reached .
Mr President , the first draft of the Azzolini report was further up the agenda , but it has slipped down .
recent statistics show that the significant trend of migration from the two countries is not a fact and none of the states that allowed access by Romanian or Bulgarian workers recorded imbalances in the labour market .
so my colleague would like to conclude with these words : &apos; For the time being , let me congratulate the Council Presidency and Parliament for their very successful collaboration , which I hope will be endorsed as a first-reading agreement by Parliament in view of a final adoption once the WTO notification procedure has been brought to an end in two months &apos; time &apos; .
why not investigate the idea of an international conference on the Balkan issue as a whole , attended by all concerned , in other words several different European countries - Serbia , Albania , Macedonia , Montenegro and Bosnia - as well as their internal minorities ?
how can we restore the confidence of consumers if we propose , by way of protection , judicial procedures that will probably never reach a conclusion ?
there is the same imprecision and the same timidity regarding the future financial framework .
there is one thing I particularly agree with : whatever decision we make with regard to energy , we should insist that the 500 million people in Europe be supplied with electricity .
in the light of the current serious humanitarian crisis , the IGAD partners decided to send a ministerial mission to Khartoum and Nairobi to explore the possibilities of securing a break in the fighting .
we are currently using the 2020 forecasts for this purpose ; however , it would not be sensible to adopt binding legal goals based on these forecasts .
the official results from Bosnia confirm that Mr Izetbegovic will be leading the new three-member presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina .
however , it has subsequently been reported in the press that Commissioner Frattini at the informal meeting of EU justice and interior ministers in early October called for a register of biometric identifiers of all non-EU citizens entering and leaving .
together with the European Fisheries Fund ( EFF ) , these represent the two main instruments for the application of the CFP .
the last century in Europe was marked by war in its first half and division into East and West in its second .
every voice in society matters , but only a united voice can make a real difference .
the great commitment of the members of the electoral committees in ensuring that all procedures were complied with was clear to see .
at the moment , Community law is an impenetrable jungle , absolutely incomprehensible to the citizens of the Community , including those whose profession involves the exercise of the law .
like Mrs Kessler , we also believe that the regulation is , as it stands , a more adequate legal instrument than the directive .
these successes should give us great satisfaction and this year &apos;s report records them , although it touches only lightly on these particular issues , for we must concentrate on the areas where progress is not satisfactory .
I am somewhat alarmed at President Prodi &apos; s recent announcement that small-scale , customised solutions will be prohibited in future .
the directive does not prohibit water transfers per se .
the new rules adopted earlier this year in accordance with Article 255 are a first step on the way .
we had a worse situation in the past , when mismanagement of large companies resulted in the fact that , in the clearance of accounts procedures , major corrections were being made against the Member States which were not passed on to the food processors and the people who were involved in the abuses in the first place .
let me assure you that it is the concern of the Council presidency to arrive at a speedy and constructive solution in close coordination with the European Parliament , the Member States of the European Union and the Commission which is in office .
on the earlier occasion , we demanded , firstly , an analysis in the form of a Green Paper providing us with a more detailed picture of the situation and , secondly , possible legislation too , but those were not the only instruments .
you also stress the need to facilitate access to justice and to support the proper functioning of the economy .
at a time of a raging economic crisis , developing the SME sector is a highly desirable thing .
to respond to Mr Pannella &apos;s point , I should like to point out that the President is present .
this report represents &apos; the lesser evil &apos; , given that the rapporteur &apos;s amendments are concerned with the contamination of seeds by GMOs and with setting the minimum technically detectible quantity as a threshold for the adventitious presence of GMOs .
to conclude , we must make certain requests .
this is not appropriate for processes since the effects do not transcend borders .
stones being hurled , cars set on fire elicit a forceful response from the police forces , and these events show up on the newspaper headlines and television screens .
our experts will then review it and decide if it needs to remain in place .
the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development should have a report every six months on the state of play in the industry and what is being done to develop and improve the sector .
a woman of conviction , a committed European , Mrs de Palacio left her mark on the European Commission , of which she was vice-president between 1999 and 2004 .
producers have 18 months in which to demonstrate that their products are safe .
but it forgot one thing : to include itself .
this too is a possibility which we should debate .
I quoted word for word what Mr Buttiglione said in the hearing .
it is nonetheless gratifying that we should have united behind some of the strategically important proposals , namely that the Union &apos; s economic policy ought to prioritise investments , partly in order to involve all the Union &apos; s citizens in the information society , something which can also be of major significance from an economic point of view .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mr Howitt on the work which he has carried out , because I think that it is extremely important work on a subject which unfortunately , in recent times , has been permanently on the agenda of our political debates .
people nowadays take all of this so much for granted that they hardly notice it any more .
apart from the concept of integration , the crux of this report is to support innovation , and God knows how much we have spoken about this in the previous report , to support innovation and creativity within the Community .
I hope you will apply competition law and merger law toughly , but always ensure that you look at each merger on its own merits .
the majority of accidents and fatalities have taken place in a commercial and professional environment , in particular as a result of inadequate ventilation and failure to use personal protective equipment .
this is because we are insisting that Europe must not forget its own history .
we are therefore talking about a very expansionist budgetary policy , at a time when the Irish Government has committed itself , in terms of the broad economic guidelines , to a budgetary policy which , in principle , ought to be more restrictive with a view to offsetting the other problems .
currently though , we have individual state provisions on television programmes in sign language .
but it was a merely a start .
concerning Serbia and Montenegro , the Commission has deliberately developed a twin-track approach in response to the complex structure of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro .
for these reasons , the Commission has launched an infringement procedure and brought the case before the European Court of Justice .
what we believe matters most of all now , though , is that the Security Council should take a decision on the status of Kosovo .
we have strived to do the opposite , because at a time when the situation in the Middle East is worse than ever , we have established an instrument whose aim is for the region as a whole to contribute to political , economic and social development , as a basic framework for resolving conflicts .
that is my question .
if so , whom in the European Union ?
financial institutions that are strong and stable are crucial to the sustainability of the capital market , to access to credit , to competitiveness , and to economic and financial stability .
the European Council should also begin to take some firm decisions on the size and shape of the ESDP mission to Kosovo as a signal of its intention .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it is with some emotion that I am taking the floor today , although I had naturally hoped for a better turnout .
I am extremely worried because the proposal , as it has been adopted and probably will be adopted in the future by the Council , has serious deficiencies which put the individual data of European citizens at serious risk .
in fact , the specific commitments made by Commissioner Deus Pinheiro on behalf of the Commission are not totally acceptable as they are opposed by at least four Member States ( Portugal , France , Spain and Italy ) .
Parliament will recall and the record shows that during the last Question Time to the Council I asked a series of questions regarding the Turkish financial cooperation agreement with the European Community .
the budget also looks to the future , with the result that EUR 3.4 billion will go on the Galileo satellite radio navigation system , and EUR 309 million on the European Institute of Technology ( EIT ) .
. I wish to congratulate Mrs De Veyrac on her important and timely report on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the information of air transport passengers on the identity of the operating carrier and on communication of safety information by Member States .
the Gallagher report is also interesting in that it refers to social aspects or regards agreements with third countries as a fundamental part of the CFP .
and above all , please , please call things by their real name .
in the case of vehicles and other major consumer items , a fundamental principle could usefully be adopted on a large scale . The producer should also be made responsible for disposing of and recycling his products .
in particular , it is argued that the Commission should provide at least 50 % of the staff of the External Action Service and that the service should not be subject to influence from intergovernmentalism .
China has learnt that . It intervenes financially throughout the world in order to support its external policy objectives .
it is therefore essential for the Commission to review the problem of taxation , so as to allow individual countries to impose higher taxes .
there is already a commercial trade in this , which is very reprehensible .
I am grateful for the off-the-cuff response she has given me today : it is voluminous and helpful .
( applause )
the practice in this House , both in the plenary and in the committees , is that if an objection is made to an oral amendment proportionate to the quorum – which means one person objecting in a committee , or 37 Members standing up in the House – the amendment cannot proceed to the vote .
this , not milk quotas or public procurement rules or the Structural Funds , is the raison d &apos;être of the European Union , Mr Weber , a European area where everyone is free to arrange their lives at their own discretion .
Madam Chairman , I share the disappointment expressed in this report at the inadequacy of the Commission ’ s response to the crisis in the fishing industry , but I will not pretend to be surprised .
Mr Commissioner , I hope you do not find this too heavy , but their hopes are lying on your shoulders .
I want to say very briefly that we have to clamp down on sex tourism and make sure that nationals from Member States can be prosecuted if they commit a crime in third countries .
firstly the Council of Europe has done an excellent job tackling this area for some years now , amongst other things by carrying out a successful youth campaign against racism , anti-Semitism , intolerance and xenophobia , in collaboration with a large number of youth organizations and anti-race discrimination movement .
we also need to follow through on existing dossiers , be it the services directive , the protection of public services or the right to universal service , and bring these into being .
I trust that the Commission will use its mandate in the negotiations to the best interests of all the Member States .
the agency was one of the first proposals : an agency bringing together the necessary know-how and specialists to ensure that we - the Commission in particular , but also Parliament - have support in what we do , in drafting legislation .
secondly , I would like to stress that we must bear in mind the religious aspect to the conflict .
the relays act as a uniquely important bridge between the European Union ’ s policy-making mechanism and the citizens to whom we are all accountable .
on Cyprus , it must stop hiding behind what happened in 2004 .
therefore we wanted to stress that there are other aspects than financial calculations of importance when decisions are taken on the need for legislation .
firstly , we are somewhat concerned with the new arrangements to review the Commission &apos;s proposals in relation to human rights and the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality .
yet their premises have been wrecked by hooligans , by Turkish criminals , who have burned down a restaurant in the capital of Europe just because it is Armenian .
it is grossly unfair to fish in the waters of the Seychelles or any other country while withholding payment from them .
we support them , but we cannot rubber-stamp this amendment , which would lead to the calling into question of a whole section of the CAP without integrating it into the overall change of direction .
in the European Parliament yesterday we had an enlightening hearing enabling us to observe that , on European soil , immigrants are considered as slaves .
it has done everything in its power to destroy any possibility of real negotiations between the Chechens and the Russian authorities .
to this end , it would use a &apos; reception &apos; line under the current sub-section B4 , which covers energy , the monitoring of nuclear safety and the environment .
we need more money in the crisis instrument , otherwise we can forget any ideas of providing assistance to Spain and Portugal in the near future .
however , the climate remains uncertain .
I cannot end my speech without congratulating Commissioner Michel on his actions in the area and for starting a political dialogue .
I am convinced that we still need production control instruments in order to guarantee stable prices for producers and give them the security to plan ahead , so that they can meet the high expectations of the consumers and the legislators .
it is ready to support confidence-building measures and the development of regional cooperation .
I am , of course , interested in hearing your priorities and expectations for these meetings .
therefore , my group has unanimously decided that either we will agree on these demands , which are nothing more than an attempt to reinforce Parliament &apos;s rights , or there will be no budget .
clear , well-defined rules governing the matter are also necessary in order to avoid the right to asylum being confused with the problem of immigration .
what my country , Portugal , and other cohesion countries cannot accept is , as a consequence of enlargement , being relegated to the margins of cohesion policy and becoming the victims of the statistical machinery that automatically places them over the critical threshold of 75 % .
the arrests of Mr Yorongar and some journalists , in particular , have been monitored closely .
it is intended to be compulsory in all of our Member States and at EU level .
but it will constitute such an instrument only if it is not deflected from its objectives .
to subjugate citizens in this way , to make them mere balancing items in an inefficient , unhealthy system , tools used to serve the interests of the financial elites , without showing any consideration for , and by endangering , their lives , what is that if not the equivalent of the ownership of human beings that is slavery ?
companies cannot become more competitive without a better-prepared labour force .
European Union policy would therefore have to be directed at the creation of overcapacity at the taxpayer &apos;s expense .
.
we have to make clear to these countries that negotiations as such cannot replace or be a substitute for adoption of the acquis .
( LT ) Madam President , today we are debating one of the most important areas of European Union policy , ensuring the well-being of our citizens and the competitiveness and growth of the entire Union .
 
programming should be improved .
in Spain , 48 % of the advertising during children programmes is for sweets , fast-food products and crisps , and in Great Britain , food products high in fats and sugar represent 80 and 90 % of the TV advertising .
a European fortress , a large fence around Europe and , in practice , preventing people from seeking asylum are not only undesirable but also unrealistic .
it is not only that the stages within the process are incomprehensible ; the length of time involved is beyond belief .
with regard to the Ombudsman , he has truly established his position and independence .
as far as maximum payment periods are concerned , we will be putting in place additional guarantees for companies because , in principle , payments have to be made within 30 days .
Mr President , smoking forms a serious threat to public health .
this is largely a question for the parties in the labour market , but society should give the basic standards and create incentives to shorten working hours .
the trouble with the Council is that everything revolves around what was agreed at Berlin .
22 . E-Justice (
I moved on to B and at that moment Mr Ferber and other Members called out to me that there was some confusion and requested an electronic check .
in fact we have used every source we could find , feeling we should not disregard any important or reliable source available to us .
this is just an important simplification .
at the same time -and this I see as particularly important - we have given our new partners in central and eastern Europe a signal , through this resolution , as to what they can do jointly with us .
but I also accept that he is right to do that in a non-prescriptive way that does not interfere with the internal constitutions of the Member States .
first , they exaggerate the amount of legislation that is adopted at EU level instead of national level , quoting 50 % or more whereas most national studies show it to be between 6 and 15 % .
the debate is closed .
yet the European Commission is also the guardian of the Treaties , and as such it monitors the Member States ’ application of legislation .
thank you , Commissioner .
the remark is this : all your speeches – even those that contained criticisms or particular points of view – at bottom were conscious of the fact that the European model has a special character and that we have given the world a lesson in how to achieve progress using a method which is not only the traditional one of power politics , and to do so without being under any illusions , without believing that we are something we are not and without believing that the world is other than it is .
with regard to relations with Turkey , these will be based on the European Council &apos;s decision , also taken in Helsinki .
I would ask the Commission to prioritise assistance to children and to orphans , to assist families and relatives in Europe and the UK to adopt orphans if they wish to , and to get assistance from the government and immigration authorities to enable this to go ahead .
there is no discrimination .
Mr President , I do not know whether Mr Berlusconi will listen to me and take up the invitation I made to him just now in my last explanation of vote , but I must say that Mr Prodi , the President of the European Commission , has listened to my sister , Anna Maria Fatuzzo , concerning this document .
that would be wrong .
we have a unique opportunity in our hands to use Europe ’ s institutions and the European dimension to meet the people ’ s demands and aspirations .
I think that it is also a little indifferent with regard to the need for policies , laws and instruments on social issues that meet the real needs of citizens , and a little off-track in its view of environmental policy on the fight against climate change as a cost or an obstacle , instead of a major opportunity for innovation and sustainable growth .
I must also refer to the guarantee issue : I do not understand why the guarantee being granted in this way is not remunerated .
ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank Mrs Estrela for her creditable report on the amendment to the Council Directive to encourage improvements to the safety and health at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding .
we have just tried to come down into the Chamber using the lift .
if nothing is done in time , we could reach the point of no return .
this approach is entirely justified when one realises that car manufacturers actually have to buy-in 70 % of their original parts .
25th report on competition policy - single market in 1995 - concentrations between undertakings - industrial restructuring - loans to SMEs ( ELISE )
cooperation with the international war tribunal at The Hague is not something which all countries can simply agree to and subsequently act as if that agreement does not exist .
I hope I have covered the most important issues raised .
previous speakers have also pointed that out .
any violations should be penalised by a drop in financial support .
for that reason , the same arrangement must apply within the global financial system as in the global trading system .
the illusion of possible national independence affects Israel too .
my message to the Commission is to get its act together and bring forward a directive that includes the issue of doping in sport .
those that are not completed by the end of the year will naturally be carried forward to next year , and thus be added to the 26 proposals for the 1999 programme .
nor are we applying more stringent standards to Turkey ; it is a country of a size that we have never seen in previous accession processes , and that is why all this has to be discussed very , very carefully .
if the Food and Veterinary Office in Dublin is indeed supposed to check the inspectors in the Member States , then it is a little late in tracking down this instance of food contamination .
I urge the Commissioner , when he goes to this meeting in Accra , to make sure that the European Union is singing off the same hymn sheet .
I am thinking especially of fuel , weapons and ammunition , because as far as other things are concerned it is usually the public at large that pays the price of an embargo .
the points raised in the report by my colleague justify the very strong link between this lack of innovation and our inability to maintain the targets set in the Lisbon Strategy .
( applause )
given the strategic value of creating the trans-European network , it would appear crucial that funding for these requirements should be guaranteed straight away , if possible even prior to the definition of the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective , in order to prevent unbearable frustrations for the Union and Member States in coming years .
these two basic legal texts have not been significantly modified for 30 years .
very often Parliament encourages the Member States to prepare a common strategy , but I would like to point out that we should start with ourselves .
finally , this Conference is about analysing what we can do that is deliverable for the least developed countries when millions of people are unable to treat pneumonia , diarrhoea , TB or AIDS ; when you have no medicines to give to your sick child or your dying wife ; when your child is at school under a tree trying to learn to write its name with a twig .
the experience of our own countries demonstrates that the debate on the past , however distressing it may be , always comes about as a result of an act of awareness within our societies and rarely , if ever , as a result of an order , of a diktat from outside .
if people insist on catching animals , then they should be sensible and shoot them .
in that respect I can mention just a few examples .
throughout this conference , ladies and gentlemen , it is not only the status of the negotiators which is important , but the quality of what they will be saying .
accordingly , there needs to be a macroeconomic framework that supports each country ’ s sustainable development , strengthening employment , social cohesion and the environment .
Europe &apos;s Constitution bears fine signatures of presidents and prime ministers .
the Member States have brought down the barriers of their national markets in order to have only one market now – the Community market – which is henceforth based on a full set of common rules , including in fields such as security , safety or air traffic management .
two things , therefore , must be safeguarded as a matter of fundamental principle : blood quality and the availability of sufficient blood and blood plasma in the European Union .
on the eve of the World Cup I handed over the final list of signatures to the anti-trafficking campaign to Commissioner Frattini .
from this there follows a course of action to put in place which , although designed to reduce disparities , is directed at the general public because it contains systemic measures .
the EU should adopt a supervisory role to ensure that national regulators work to a consistent standard .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am well aware of the importance of the directive on data retention that has just been adopted .
the explanatory statement very clearly sets out the reasons for so doing .
that should not necessarily be the case .
the number of parties represented in national parliaments varies considerably across the Member States .
it aspires to improving a situation that is indeed common .
the next very important issue is to draw up appropriate agreements or contracts with countries outside the EU .
transparency has won the day , even if the precautionary principle looks a little the worse for wear .
Anwar Ibrahim should be released immediately if Mahathir &apos;s failing Malaysia is to be restored to health and prosperity in the eyes of the watching world community .
the Commission must in future act in a more transparent and impressive way , and display greater confidence in its dealings with Parliament , so that we can jointly bring the discharge procedure to a satisfactory conclusion .
it is being evaluated , fortunately , before we move on to SAVE II .
after a three-year break , the Steering Committee of the Multilateral Working Group on Water Resources ( MWGWR ) for the region began work again in 1999 and adopted specific programmes on the saving and use of water resources in the Middle East , with EU funding .
it is a courageous decision , but it is a decision that was called for by the people of Luxembourg .
I have said that the Commission intends to leave office as soon as possible , and this naturally depends on when the Member States and Parliament decide to appoint and approve our successors .
we can see from the number of women elected to national parliaments that the Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands are in the lead , that the southern European and English-speaking countries are trailing way behind , and that the role of women in the East has even been forced into a decline .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Galeote Quecedo emphasises , in his explanatory statement , one essential point which was completely neglected in the Commission communication on the development of the external service , and that is the absence of any effective functional link between the embassies of the Member States and the Community delegations .
finally , the same can be said of the European charters , which our Parliament has fortunately just rejected .
and , secondly , to the hard line stance taken by the Turkish-Cypriot leader Denktash , who is refusing to sit down to inter-community talks and who is being encouraged in this stance by Turkey .
this scheme is a strong symbol of the solidarity between the citizens of the EU , and I hope that the appropriations allocated to this scheme can be maintained .
the Hungarian Presidency is committed to advancing the proposals in the refugee package .
health services occupy a specific place in society .
our interest is to have a European currency , if indeed there has to be one in that form , which stands out as the currency of reference in relation to the dollar and not the reverse ; it is that developing countries should experience balanced development , albeit in the shelter of cautious protectionism ; it was to have NATO in opposition to the Warsaw Pact , but since the Warsaw Pact has disappeared , NATO ’ s legitimacy as a tool of American dominance is no longer justified ; it is not taking part in all the wars in which we do not have to intervene ; it is that Latin America , by virtue of its links with Portugal and Spain , does not constitute a backyard of the United States .
Latvia has always felt itself to belong to Europe and its values , even when Latvia and other Central and Eastern European nations were long bound to a state where many values were looked at through a special ideological prism .
in many respects , it is a good idea to group the various programmes together .
this Parliament could not possibly support anything that does not involve an explicit recognition on the part of all of the Palestinian authorities , whoever they may be , that Israel is a reality with which they must hold dialogue and reach agreement .
in this context , the Council welcomes and strongly supports the resolution adopted by the UN General Assembly at its 60th session in September 2005 , which emphasises the role of both formal and informal education in the achievement of poverty eradication and other Millennium Development Goals .
the highest levels were in Finland with 36 % .
while putative future disputes with the EU are probably the least of Egypt &apos;s concerns for the moment , I believe that there can be no disadvantage in adopting mechanisms that enable these to be resolved easily , for the good of both parties .
the problems we face - high energy prices , climate change , increasing dependence on imported hydrocarbons - are global and European problems .
the budget for 2011 is heavily influenced by the crisis and the recession and this is clear , among other things , from the very tight margins .
this is my answer .
Hermange report ( A5-0009 / 2002 )
I was , however , persuaded that this debate will return to this House , because the pharmaceutical industry no longer wants to make do with placing new bogus treatments on the market and overprotecting them for years .
we have neglected the environment too often to allow ourselves to do such a thing again .
in fact , the entire Italian beef industry is extremely concerned by the proposal , and not just because of the maximum limits it imposes on travelling time .
tomorrow morning we will have the opportunity to discuss this aspect .
Mr President , Mrs Flesch quite rightly declares an interest in matters in which she has an interest .
therefore , I welcome the recognition made by the European Commission , in its communication of last week , of the importance of the Schengen area , and of the challenge of strengthening and developing it .
I wanted to ask him a question about the third disease mentioned in this report , and suggest to him that perhaps we should concentrate on this least glamorous of the three , because tuberculosis could be eradicated .
( NL ) Mr President , Commissioner , we are in the middle of a crisis and , if truth be told , we have more important things to be doing at this point in time than pointing fingers and assigning blame .
at the end of the 1980s , a plan was drafted in the European Commission whereby the then European Community would consolidate as a federation and the other countries of Europe would join the Single Market via the European Economic Area arrangements .
President Borrell , it is a great honour to be here again .
I venture to suggest that a decision like this , condemning racism and xenophobia , would be unanimous .
we need to get our internal policies right , we need to improve global governance in this area and we need to make a real contribution to the most vulnerable .
as of now , these campaigns have yet to be organised .
that is surely the wrong way !
the Commission will also report regularly to Parliament and the Council as to the implementation of such actions .
( the sitting was opened at 9 a.m. )
increasing the number of bodies in the area of political do-gooding while these same political groups and this same Parliament are stifling the economic freedom which could earn the money for a real improvement in the living standards of the peoples of Europe is a misjudgement and a classic political faux pas .
various examples of very constructive initiatives taken by the Russian authorities could be mentioned ; however those centres are faced with an extremely difficult budgetary situation .
it is true that you do have plans that attract me in fiscal matters .
the third is the move to qualified majority voting on a simple decision of the Council , which would also be a mistake .
with regard to Europe , I should like to quote the words of Johan Cruyff : ‘ ’ – for every disadvantage there is an advantage . I hope that we can use this momentum together for the benefit of effective European solidarity .
finally , the last point that I wanted to highlight concerns job creation .
you did not disappoint us .
secondly , it is vital to have a guarantee that Regulation ( EC ) No 865 / 2006 on the CITES will be amended , since this will result in a general exemption for the internal trade in bluefin tuna .
– Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , a minute is a very short time , so I shall confine myself to making a single point .
Hungarians have always regarded the Japanese with cousinly affection , which makes the disaster particularly shocking .
however , there are areas where we could bring Parliament and , indeed , Europe closer to the people .
in other words , the aid must be tailored directly to women to do the most benefit .
this element is crucial , because projects must be developed not only through broad European participation , but also - and from their very inception - in the context of close cooperation between the main players involved in the various countries .
enlargement , however , must not lead to a situation where regional policy in the most disadvantaged regions of the current Member States is wound down .
Article 17 of the Treaty , which the United Kingdom also signed , makes it quite clear that the common market is to promote the harmonization of social systems and free trade , and is to combat unfair competition .
without anticipating the Council &apos; s final decision , it is clear that our objective is no less than that of creating a single European airspace : fifteen countries under one sky .
what happened is that the Community created new trade frontiers well beyond the present EU boundaries .
this is a welcome proposal .
hence the worrying decline in meat consumption .
earthquakes are catastrophic events that claim very many lives and cause huge damage to property .
a complete disaster .
with the plethora of new TV channels , with digital TV , have we got anywhere with a Parliamentary TV channel ?
within this context , the Committee on Development proposes that Parliament give its assent , subject to ratification by the Côte d &apos;Ivoire of the stepping-stone EPA .
everything seems to imply that , in the eyes of some , it would not be good news but bad news if Dr Blix were to state that the inspectors had been able , overall , to access all sites easily , to the point of having carried out 300 inspections in 60 days .
the best example I know is a bus company which operates a service from a part of the west of Ireland which I represent to London and is allowed to pick up passengers within Ireland but is forbidden to take on any new passengers in any of the major cities or towns in north or south Wales or in the north or south-west of England .
moreover - and I expect the US shares this desire - we would like to see the Doha Development Round being concluded as quickly as possible .
the parties have to fully comply with the commitments in order to legally implement the merger .
we cannot , however , rest on these laurels .
global warming will bring more pests : we cannot continue endlessly to increase the amounts of pesticides used .
there has been some talk here of the need for popular acceptance and to listen to the people , whereas we all know that a majority of the population in a great many of our Member States is today opposed to a common currency .
there is illtreatment , imprisonment , enforced labour and slave trading .
we hope you have recovered your voting card because I see you are ready to vote .
as I have previously stated , in spite of constant and perhaps excessive amounts of legislative output , it is possible to monitor closely the Community institutions ’ legislative output and more importantly the impact thereof .
as you have pointed out , European industry is still complaining that there are an excessive number of barriers and obstacles that put it at a competitive disadvantage .
what has been produced by the Commission is a major contribution to dealing with the saturation of airspace .
thank you , Mr President .
I should like to ask you whether the Commission will continue to insist upon defending certain international political or economic democratic organizations or is it going to submit to this form of interference by the G7 in international political life ?
in the first instance , I wanted to see these articles deleted .
we believe that the EU should have a common asylum and immigration policy .
we , as women , represent added value for the common good of society ; we bring about peace , we have knowledge to share and a special kind of wisdom to pass on , wherever we are , including in Turkey .
following an armed insurrection , Albanians living in Macedonia were given administrative and even territorial autonomy of the widest extent , while in the case of Romania , the European Union does not press for territorial autonomy for the almost one million Hungarians living in Székely Land .
I would therefore ask you to put them to the vote , please .
we need , however , to do this within a framework of clear rules that ensure that the system is effective , economical , and scrupulously respects Community rules on personal data protection .
improving road infrastructure and , where possible , separating pedestrians from road traffic also seem to be effective solutions .
researchers at universities , on the other hand , must be able to publish their findings in order to establish and confirm their academic credentials .
with this , a second , unassailable goal has been achieved , namely that if we want to have long-term use of such natural resources as coal , oil and gas , we will need to learn to treat these in a responsible manner .
I think we are going to discuss this , particularly this afternoon .
I think it is clear that we should stop waiting until we have an outcome from the Doha Round and immediately start with the reform of the WTO : reform both of its procedures and also of its policies , because reform of process alone is not enough .
Commissioner , this recommendation we are debating , which is attempting to fix minimum requirements for vessels carrying dangerous goods and entering port within the European Union , is experiencing a situation which is all too common .
as we have seen , the agency was created in a difficult period for the Balkans .
the Commission naturally understands , for example , the desire – I have been questioned recently on this issue – to see the application of a unilateral ban on illegally sourced timber .
it is a strong and encouraging sign for the next ACP-EU Joint Assembly which will take place at the end of October .
it will enable us to ensure that we have uniform training throughout Europe , a single , recognisable , system , which is accessible and also promotes through-travel ; thus increasing the real speed of freight railways , and , with it , safety and reliability .
I have heard what our colleague has said .
( Parliament approved the joint text )
glad though I am that the social partners are to be involved in devising and implementing projects , and that we are , together , endeavouring to improve the exchange of best practices , I do repudiate the Commission ’ s ideas about separate ESF projects for convergence on the one hand and regional competitiveness on the other .
that is why the votes are taking place now , and also why we unfortunately cannot complete our debate this morning , as we could have done if we had held the votes at midday .
however , in modern agriculture they are an unavoidable by-product of agricultural production methods .
it is also a question of social fairness .
my Group wishes to stress that this should be a normal part of the procedure .
this is conducive to reducing the vulnerability of the Nepalese to the Maoist rebels .
we must give due consideration to inhumane conditions for animals for slaughter , as it goes on with the support of the Union .
the fishing industry is especially important in social and employment terms in a large number of European regions , although it has been increasingly neglected - notably in the Community budget - in comparison with other economic and financial interests , which are given preference , but which do not have the social relevance and importance that this sector has , and will continue to have , in our society .
I would also like to emphasise that enlargement should call for a major financial review .
these would require a special initiative , as I see it .
the counterpart to the public service , efficiency and flexibility , which have been mentioned several times in this debate , is in any case based on nothing more than a doctrinaire a priori .
it is important that there be a balance between these three areas , which are all vital to the process .
although the transitional period is somewhat limited , we assume that the feed industry and poultry farming will find sound alternatives to these substances within that time .
there is , on the one hand , the debate about whether investigation of dominant position should refer to the national market on one occasion and to the European market on another .
I would like to end with a slogan for the future , when disabled people will not just be ‘ Getting on Board ’ but also ‘ Staying on Board ’ .
it is not good or sound budgeting to fail to pay out on the outstanding commitments agreed on in previous years , so both must be taken into account when shaping the final draft proposal for 2012 .
true equality is still a dream and discrimination against women is a fact of life .
this will prevent differing treatment within a single family .
that was the key flaw in the existing prospectus directive and again we are very pleased at the development of the text .
however , it will certainly be an important occasion , bringing together all the various ideas and philosophies from around the Union and demonstrating that , as well as a sound monetary basis , attention is also to be focused on developing the coordination of economic policy and a stronger employment policy .
it goes without saying that we also support all the work being done by the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize , Mr Óscar Arias , and accordingly we also hope that , once the aforementioned measures are in place , elections can be held in November 2009 with full transparency and with total respect for the democratic system and for human rights .
Parliament has always faithfully celebrated this date , but unfortunately this date has not yet achieved the scope that it should have within the European institutions and Member States .
at present , over 200 million adults and 14 million children in the European Union are overweight or suffering from obesity .
incidentally it did not escape the attention of India , which has opened a dispute against us before the WTO on this matter .
time is not on our side , we need to reach agreement on this matter , as early as it is possible to do so , and the Irish presidency is ambitious that should be the case .
my view is that it is sensible now to put into practice the closer cooperation revisions that we see inside the Treaty .
why announce now something that is due to happen in 2009 ?
I understand - we all understand - that when GNI goes down , the contribution will go down , but it should not go down as a percentage of GNI and then go down again .
since the signing of the WTO agreements , the profits made by producers on the prices of raw and primary materials have continually sunk so low that in the South as well as the North more and more small and medium-sized firms will have to close .
there are only 877 driftnet fishermen in Ireland .
the people on the receiving end are bound to be bitterly disappointed when the money - which amounts to a maximum of EUR 500 million per annum - runs out ; if the EU awakens great hopes , but fails to do as it has promised , the result will be frustration among the public .
I therefore insist that everything possible should be done to give the European Parliament all the power it deserves , as against the Council , whose powers should instead be reduced , since it does not deserve them .
these are not logical formulations .
similarly , in the first reading , Parliament made available the resources for the jobs initiative .
in order to minimise human suffering and enhance our own credibility , we need to introduce one more correction to the external relations budget .
the fact that we work to financial perspectives within different categories or with different categories means that if we use the ABB system we will not know what the ceilings are within the different categories .
I read in Agence Europe on 1 April that the Council of Agriculture Ministers appears to have detected this schizophrenia and is drawing up measures to improve the coordination of the Union &apos;s trade and policy actions .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
I would simply like to ask the Commissioner if she realizes the impact her decision may have with regard to copper .
Europe has many things that are envied around the world : our fashion , our lifestyle , our social-security systems - and , increasingly , our diet .
if you are advising people and helping people to build a bridge , it is useful and good for the image of the European Union that people should know that the European Union is giving help .
other colleagues , too , have referred to this matter .
I shall conclude by recalling that one of the points highlighted by the report is this very lack of information , resulting in the stunted development of a sense of European citizenship .
the best instrument for achieving this is , using the same method as the Convention , to bring together European and national parliaments , national governments and the European Commission .
( DE ) Mr President , if you listened to the first round of speakers , you would have gained an idea of who was responsible for the crisis of confidence , and it is true that this is what it has now become . Firstly it was the Commission , secondly the speculators and thirdly the Council and , in particular , Mrs Merkel .
it makes a contribution to highlighting the benefits from the introduction of the euro which are directly tangible to consumers .
it is the result of a defective system , an erroneous Common Agricultural Policy that plunges farmers into a vicious circle of producing ever-increasing amounts ever more cheaply , investing ever more heavily , having ever larger scales of operation which must be farmed ever more intensively .
we are working on property rights .
this is also a response to President Bush ’ s restrictive policy , which has sparked protests around the world .
Mrs Reding , the CNIL has investigated , looking for various unpleasant keywords such as Gypsies , Gyppos , Roma , and has not found any evidence that the National Gendarmerie holds any such files .
it must make its contribution to creating employment in the European Union .
with regard to the Constitution , Mr President , I believe that what is going to happen in practice , which is the suspension of the referenda , is a good thing : this is not the right time to hold more referenda and we must dedicate ourselves to debate .
it will send out a clear message at international level that Serbian membership of the EU is on the current political agenda .
we need more European innovation for renewables and everything that concerns environmentally friendly technologies .
it does not simply look back , does not merely seek to solve the problems we brought with us from the past , but it seeks to create a recipe for cooperation which can tackle the tasks of the future .
in writing . - ( LT ) I voted in favour of this report .
the Berlin straitjacket means , above all , that Europe cannot realise its responsibilities .
in conclusion , I should like to say that satisfactory results in relation to this issue depend to a large extent on the use of safe and good quality feedingstuffs .
this would run against the necessary and overdue adjustment of the industry which constituted the primary reason for allowing a seven-year period .
what is more , there is no decision as to what mechanism of cofinancing by Member States would be introduced , and we know that proposals on this are very diverse .
where there are very sophisticated markets - indeed one of the most successfully integrated markets in the European Union - it makes no sense to apply protections designed for retail investors in equities .
Mr President , in Iran , where the principles of fundamentalism are supported by a large section of society , the activities of all democratic institutions which are based on different cultural precepts encounter a great deal of opposition and intolerance .
in recent weeks the regime has been reaping the bitter fruits of the explosive social and political situation that it has to some extent created itself .
I will eagerly await Parliament &apos;s position on this matter .
finally , if the European Union is to be credible , if it is itself to respect rights and be respected , it must put its own house in order and not be afraid to respond and take action when violations occur .
no .
fortunately for development cooperation we also have the G0.7.
for example , the goals for employing our citizens and relieving them from poverty are far from being reached .
freedom of expression must therefore go hand in hand with respect for other peoples .
I hope not to repeat them .
in particular , the experience of these years clearly demonstrates that funding of economic actions such as innovation , research and the environment from the European Regional Development Fund ( ERDF ) can be more effective if closely coordinated and integrated with the actions undertaken by the European Social Fund ( ESF ) .
there were very many young people helping out in the polling stations , and , when we asked them what they wanted , they said , ‘ We want education , education , education ’ .
without solidarity , we can never be united .
Mr President , a study carried out by the highly renowned Johns Hopkins Hospital Medical School in the USA in collaboration with the Baghdad Medical School , published last month in the internationally prestigious medical journal The Lancet , showed that approximately 655 000 civilians have died as a result of the violent hostilities in Iraq between March 2003 and July 2006 .
the European Parliament stands by its promise to attain 20 µg / m3 by ... 2015 !
the consequences of a lack of reform would be all the more serious were it not for enlargement .
I therefore ask for support for the amendment that Giles Chichester and I have brought in .
I support the rejection and I request the Commission to come back with a better proposal that takes account of the Lisbon Treaty , takes account of codecision , takes account of simplicity and effectiveness in monitoring and is consistent with the Commission &apos;s and Parliament &apos;s responsibilities in other areas .
Mr President , as a visibly greying member of the population I have a considerable interest in this debate , as do many others in this House .
some of my fellow Members have concerns , which I understand up to a point , but it is important for us to recognise that nanotechnology is one of the keys to the future .
the numbers of port operators should not be restricted except for compelling reasons .
the new Treaty of Lisbon provides more effective and more transparent institutional conditions for the EU to play its role in the world .
at a time when the Commission is preparing to draft a new legislative proposal on the next stages in border management , I would ask the Commission to evaluate first of all the effectiveness of the current systems used to manage borders in order to achieve the best synergy between these systems , and then assess the opportunity for investments in border logistics .
it is my hope and my conviction that , on 15 September , I shall be able , with my head held high , to come back to you , Mr President , and to you , Commissioner , with the message : &apos; It was a ? yes ? &apos; vote .
she also asked me about the structural funds and raised the particular issue of the handling of the Highlands and the Islands .
the Taliban , the al-Qaeda network and Osama bin Laden represent the greatest , most urgent risk for the European Union .
the Council quite reasonably asks us if it is necessary to hold a Convention in order to ratify an agreement reached with all of the EU Member States .
( applause )
2007 was a decisive year , because we set out our precise objectives .
it is a disgrace that this happens .
European Union citizens must receive better information and more clarity regarding the legal rules applicable to travel to a Member State other than the Member State of affiliation for the purpose of receiving healthcare .
inaction as regards the prevention of counterfeiting promotes impunity and appears cynical .
our airport is very close to housing and , like 20 % of Europe &apos; s citizens , we suffer levels of noise from aircraft which health experts consider to be unacceptable .
the original Commission proposal was barely in line .
politicians are very much at fault here , because they do not sufficiently oppose violence against women and often pretend that it does not exist on such a large scale .
some years after Barcelona this seems absolutely clear .
we are satisfied with the reply , as long as the explanatory statement can be amended , and the Conference of Presidents has agreed to amend it as necessary .
there are very large Russian populations in many states of the former Soviet Union , such as Ukraine .
we must recognise that the emotional element in the referendum restricted the purely rational element of political representation .
there is no doubt that the damage to the Fukushima nuclear power plant is a disaster , but the final death toll will not be counted in thousands or hundreds , and perhaps not even in tens .
I believe that was the right thing to do , and I have no problem with it .
later on , we joined forces and managed , in tandem with the Commission , to put certain things in order thanks to the action plan .
I believe that only a major reform can save the common agricultural policy .
there needs to be discretion on some of those matters .
I do not intend to talk about the World Cup in France here , but there are a few general points I wish to make .
( the sitting was suspended at 1.20 p.m. and resumed at 3.05 p.m. )
this is the current price of the advantages listed , of the better world .
Mr Kasoulides , Mr Brok and others have said that we should make it very clear to the Palestinian people that it is the European Union that is helping them .
Mr President , I represent a party that entered Parliament this year .
the European Parliament has not exactly been clean in its approach to things throughout its history .
it must be a list that includes hundreds of people and it should be made public in Belarus as well .
the global phase-out of single-hull oil tankers and the backlog of old vessels now being withdrawn from the market , many of which contain hazardous substances , allow us to predict an uncontrolled expansion in sub-standard facilities in South Asia , which may even spread to African countries .
that will be corrected , Mr Poignant .
the border inspection posts are obliged to carry out documentary , identity and physical checks .
I have studied in detail the report by Mrs Heidi Hautala .
so I think it would be a good idea to review this composition and provide it with a real Community dimension , at EU level .
I find it sad that there are MEPs who are trying to weaken the Commission &apos; s proposal .
for that reason , the management of foreign reserve assets is extremely important from the very beginning .
the Commission would of course prefer to give priority to a solution first discussed by representatives of workers and employers , but the fact that we did not manage to persuade them to come to the table for discussions last June forced the Commission to submit a draft on its own initiative .
here too , I can accept the amendment , but I would also like to see a reference indicator retained , as the Commission &apos;s proposal aims to overcome the current shortcomings in relation to protecting the health of vulnerable persons .
China has been part of the WTO for nearly four years .
I was incensed when , as late as yesterday , the Commission could not advise us as to exactly what would be involved in &apos; category &apos; .
thus , the political climate in Cambodia is tense , elections are approaching and vote-winning tactics are being employed , but there is also a drift towards authoritarianism , and I would like to mention , aside from the Rainsy case , that of NGO representatives who have been prosecuted : the politician Mu Sochua , found guilty of defaming the Prime Minister , the journalist Hang Chakra , imprisoned for having denounced the corruption within the Deputy Prime Minister Sok An &apos;s entourage , and so on .
this is difficult to accomplish because companies selling plane tickets do not have the necessary overview of security costs for airports .
the vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.
these recommendations were the subject of a Commission communication adopted on 16 December .
firstly , we wish to protect flora and fauna and secondly , there are a large number of coastlines along which , on the one hand , tourists enjoy themselves and on the other jobs are to be created .
it is therefore understandable that the Cuban Government and of course a large part of the Cuban population should respond with defence mechanisms appropriate to a war situation .
since the Crampton report has set most of these objectives , our group voted in favour of it despite some of the lacks and difficulties inherent in the search for a consensus starting out from widely-divergent positions within the Committee on Fisheries .
Ryanair has helped to reverse air price arrangements in Europe ; it has secured favourable deals from private airports .
hence we must ensure sustainable agriculture , in which the maximum investment is made in protecting and improving rural areas and the environment , so that not only we , but also our children , can take pleasure in them .
it is simply unfair .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I would like to congratulate Mr Iturgaiz Angulo on his work .
another threat already identified is cyber attacks and different attempts to attack and block via the Internet .
the security and stability of the Western Balkans are a paramount interest of the region itself and of the whole of Europe .
the debt cancellation programmes must be tailored to the specific circumstances of each individual country .
we also need to do something about trade .
these questions need to be answered .
the second example is that of GMOs .
with the reorganisation of the policy we have a new situation .
the North Gas Pipeline will shut off the possibility of diversification and limit the possibility of the development of Baltic ports , and especially of a new diversified source of gas supply for Europe , the Świnoujście Gas Terminal .
we seek transparency , and we would also like to be sure that support is actually reaching our intended targets .
nobody can censure another Member nor can they take legal action either in Italy or any other country over something said in this Chamber .
( BG ) First of all , Mr Strasser , I would like to say that I cannot agree that there is no information on how eavesdropping devices have been used .
in absolute figures , the United States spends about USD 110 billion per year more than Europe on research and development , an amount equivalent to the EU budget .
I call on the Commission to fulfil its obligations and take action accordingly .
I believe that the most desirable thing , as a result of these agreements , would be for a recall referendum to take place soon , which is the European Union &apos;s desire , expressed by means of various statements by the Council of Ministers of the European Union on the initiative of the Commission , and for a mission of European Union electoral observers to be appointed to accompany this process of ratifying and holding the recall referendum , which is the institutionally established mechanism .
Madam President , this own-initiative report has moved away from its cultural objectives , as my colleague Mr Monfils has just said .
for we are no longer the European Economic Community ; we are the European Union , and so we need common values , with the consequences that derive from them .
looking at the state of the country at present , you have the feeling that the whole island of Madagascar has the plague on board .
so if Latvia can do it , why can not we ?
the effects may be described as follows :
I would like to say that our group , the PPE-DE , fully supports the strategy laid out by the general rapporteur with a view to the conciliation with the other two institutions .
but it isn &apos; t on , Mr President , Commissioner , that regions might suffer because Member States are failing in their duties !
I get the impression that , especially where biofuels are concerned , there is no lack of interest : the research and investment communities are circling , but afraid to take a leap in the dark .
decisions must be taken on the ESF with partners that are as close to the ground as possible .
the greatest tragedy of the earthquake was the loss of a whole generation of Kashmiris .
.I voted in favour of the Ransdorf report because it highlights the importance of nanosciences and nanotechnologies in fields as diverse as medicine , surgery , energy , electronics , metallurgy , and so on .
however , when the criteria used to collect data focus exclusively on race , ethnicity or religion , they should be considered discriminatory , and thus illegal .
a further central issue is the concentration of support on disadvantaged regions in an enlarged EU with clear , transparent and quantifiable criteria for the concept of &apos; poor regions &apos; .
what do we find ?
do you not believe that , if we remove CONNECT , it could be interpreted as a new milestone in the tendency for the issues within your competence to lose importance . I am beginning to suspect that this is what the Council intends : to see to it that all educational and cultural fields should lose importance .
the message to the European Council on this is extremely clear .
when we began working on the TENs in 1994 , it was clear from the outset that the TENs will not be some unique event that suddenly erupts like a volcano , something that is decided just like that ; what was clear is that there will be a process that will continue for a number of years and will also have to be reviewed constantly .
what is now before us , despite the heartfelt concern displayed by Mrs Berger , will , in my view , not lead to anything .
it is now our duty to discover the whole truth about the reports of the kidnapping and mistreatment of alleged terrorists by the CIA and their illegal transfer to other countries , with the complicity of certain European governments .
we have requested a review of the terms for accessing the European Social Fund and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund in order to support more employees who are seriously affected by the economic crisis and job losses .
being closely involved in the industry , I can assure Members that a huge effort has been made to make British beef safe .
the letter requested and proposed taking every measure aimed at banning , and I will read from the text : &apos; the offering , dissemination or promotion of financial instruments within the European Union , including investment insurance and in particular insurance products associated with investment funds , if their yield is directly linked to speculation on the increase in the price of food raw materials &apos; .
the purpose of the migration plan , which was seen in isolation in those days , was to come up with an integrated and coherent answer to what was happening on the ground , to identify the key elements for effectively regulating migration and to define a new framework for the Union &apos;s action .
all you will be able to adopt in these three days is banalities , and I believe that this issue deserves better than that .
if it did happen , it would revolve around Tibet and not Burma , which is the topic of debate at this moment .
now , at second reading , Mr Evans is proposing six amendments to the common position , on which I shall now comment .
thank you , once again , for the last comment , Mrs Cederschiöld .
lastly , on my report relating to an Agency to harmonise rail safety , the competent committee has already voted on 48 amendments . I thought we could have left it there , but yet another amendment has just been tabled .
climate change is a global political priority at the Copenhagen Summit .
the next item is the recommendation for second reading ( A4-0068 / 98 ) , on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism , on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a Council Directive on the registration of persons sailing on board passenger ships operating to or from ports of the Member States of the Community ( Rapporteur : Mr Watts ) ( C4-0620 / 97-96 / 0281 ( SYN ) ) .
the rapporteur suggests that , in addition to support for the start-up and initial development phase , as the Commission proposes , there should also be better coverage of other phases in the life of a new company , and he also underlines the importance of improving the geographical spread in the take-up of the remaining facilities .
two opinions of the Scientific Committee on Toxicity , Ecotoxicity and the Environment from February and June 2000 highlight the damage that could be caused by pentaBDE in relation to discharging this substance into the environment and its being a persistent and bioaccumulative substance .
I really must therefore ask you not to discredit those Member States that take their reporting of irregularities seriously and make frequent reports as required by the Regulation by saying they are the &apos; strongholds &apos; , because it is a difficult instrument .
the promotion of regional integration is one of the cornerstones of the partnership . This is clearly stated in the Commission &apos;s communication , and it is also how Brazil perceives it .
( FI ) Mr President , Commissioner , I too would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur Kyösti Virrankoski for his excellent preparation of the budget .
Alexander Lukashenko &apos;s arrogance of power knows no limits .
Mr President , the old monopolies are no longer up to providing the efficient service which we have all come to regard as a right .
( the President cut off the speaker )
those who introduced the human rights clause in the Agnoletto report have a great deal to answer for , because they gave the EU an alibi and pretext for its criminal policies against the people .
charity is not solidarity ; sharing is .
the European Union is a form of political organisation which is based on the experience of the nation state .
I did not negotiate it , nor am I the Ukrainian Government , but anyone who seeks to tamper with it must know that he is giving others an excuse to make the whole thing fail .
under the principle of subsidiarity , I welcome giving national parliaments a monitoring role through an early-warning system , the obligation on the Commission and the European Union to give reasons justifying every proposal and , in general , all measures that favour greater transparency in invoking and applying the principle .
Mrs Izquierdo Rojo , that is not a point of order .
we in this House watched murder and rape in Bosnia .
the very clear message which emerges from these forecasts , from these recommendations , is that , where additional measures must be taken for 1998 within the framework of the lasting nature of convergence , it is necessary that these measures are structural and not just one-off .
we already know that that the Commission , too , has to cut its coat to suit the limited cloth of the medium-term financial framework .
today &apos;s votes are therefore , in my view , an opportunity to point out that the European budget is not just an accounting tool that everyone finds daunting : it is , first and foremost , the &apos; power &apos; behind the European Union that enables it to work day in day out to protect its citizens , and particularly through the EGF , to protect unemployed workers .
this afternoon , we will briefly dwell on the Communist reign of terror in North Korea .
when I was there , a long time ago now , people could really live on islands like Bijagós .
we must also take account of the fact that immigration is due to deep-seated causes that go beyond the purely technical aspect of crossing external borders that has been mentioned today .
President Barroso made it clear , after the inspection carried out by officials of our Food and Veterinary Office , that we consider that the ban on certain Polish exports is not proportionate .
the report does not go further , because we believe that there must be a broad consensus and , obviously , the relevant arrangements in line with this principle must be studied and adopted in the appropriate international forums .
there are currently over 23 million people in Europe who are without work .
as regards the other issues such as the development of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers that will doubtless occupy an important place in the upcoming forum &apos;s debates , Mr Sosa Wagner &apos;s report makes it very clear what agreed position we representatives of the Europeans institutions will be arguing together at the IGF .
mainly , however , because it broke with a principle that is essential in our view : the existence of a link between the average salary level of the citizens of a country and the salary level of their representatives .
it is absolutely clear that special issues are violence against women and trafficking in human beings .
in this report we speak of the position that Parliament must take in the conciliation procedure and a number of main subjects traditionally have a part to play in first reading conciliation .
on the issue of tobacco growing the approach should be that subsidies for tobacco growing should be phased out within a five to ten-year period .
as far as Parliament is concerned , that is not the case .
Mr Prodi , for example , stressed the need to restore peace throughout the country during his visit to Algiers on 12 and 13 January .
if you want us to achieve the things that you yourself postulate , then give us the powers , give us the money , and do not stand in Europe ’ s way as it moves towards political union , or in the way of the Common Foreign and Security Policy .
the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo is getting worse .
if we look at the family photo from Copenhagen in 2002 , there are 64 people in that picture , including just eight women .
you all know that the airlines make most profit on the North Atlantic route and not on internal European routes .
the EU 2020 growth strategy must be sustainable and inclusive .
Mr President , as agreed with my group and in line with the approach that I outlined before the first ballot , I am withdrawing my candidacy and I urge all the Members who voted for me , whom I would like to thank , to now vote for Mr David Martin .
.
as far as the citizens are concerned , Europe is synonymous with waste of money .
if not , someone really needs to come up with a better technical solution .
it is a great honour for me to be able to speak to you on this occasion today in the European Parliament . This makes it clear that the reunification of Germany was by no means just a national matter , but also a fundamental European issue .
B5-0119 / 01 by Mrs Sörensen , Mrs Lucas , Mrs Hautala and Mrs Evans , on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group , on Nigeria ;
I understood that it was before the Council .
with regard to enlargement , various speakers have said that enlargement cannot be delayed .
they are annoyed because they themselves can no longer endure this situation .
on the procedural question as distinct from the substantive question , my understanding is that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has or will be requesting additional information from the Spanish authorities - I presume in the light of what you have just said .
fortunately , the present Commissioner realises that this should be seen in a wider context , and I am delighted that he is now giving this experiment a structural dimension .
Mr Andria &apos;s proposed amendment is important because it underlines the significance of the Trilateral Agreement reached by Italy , Croatia and Slovenia in Brussels on 4 June 2004 .
however , rather than regulating the Internet , I would prefer a solution which involves educating Internet users and resorting to regulations or restrictions in limited cases only .
we have two options .
large-scale and strategic investments in the countries of origin are necessary . You might well want to call it a modern Marshall Plan .
the EU stands ready to enhance its cooperation with governments in order to combat intolerance and protect human rights .
however , this should be accompanied , at the same time , by significant attempts by the European Union to bring democracy and stability to the region because the temptation towards totalitarianism still has a strong influence in this region , and we also have a general lack of democracy .
that is why a policy as fundamental and permanent as the common agricultural policy ( CAP ) must be understood by its main beneficiaries ; in this case , European farmers .
the EU must also ensure that it does not encourage the further decimation of the large expanses of untouched environmental beauty in the applicant countries .
this debate must at least be held - we must use this opportunity .
I also wish that EU leaders had said before what they are saying today .
both are not ends in themselves but must be conducted bravely with the aim that the people of Israel and Palestine can live in real security , in peace and with respect for their dignity .
this time , assisted by Mr Fabra Vallés &apos;s report , we are looking at the management , or rather the nonmanagement , of the MED programmes . One of the peculiarities of this situation is that its excesses border on the absurd .
this directive should remedy the situation .
to close , I should like to call on the European Union to increase its budget , because this will give our Europe a future .
we always hear that cultural diversity must be promoted .
the present version of the project is a broad compromise in which the main aims appear to have been achieved : full implementation of the internal market in postal services , mainly through termination of the mail monopoly , and assured continuation of a high-quality , low-cost public service .
all of these themes are closely connected .
a number of points of criticism have been made , not only of security issues of interest to the United States , but also matters of interest to the European Union , for example data protection standards , passenger data and the issue of SWIFT ; these issues are being addressed openly rather than being evaded , and the Commission and the Presidency have already made it clear that all of them will be raised with the Americans .
finally , I support the Committee on Development and Cooperation &apos;s opinion that it would be useful if the European Commission could negotiate regional agreements to cover areas like Guinea , Guinea-Bissau , and so on .
so there is a need for training and awareness raising and a better balance of women and men in decision making .
it is difficult for foreign crime victims to follow the legal proceedings at a distance , which is why special measures are also required to guarantee the legal position of foreign crime victims .
this results , de facto , from the fundamentally ambiguous situation in that area .
the Council will do everything to safeguard these principles , particularly with regard to the right of every person to respect for their private and family life , their home or their correspondence , in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights which forms the cornerstone of our political work .
it takes the principle of partnership back to basics , involving the public , private and voluntary sectors in joint action to boost employment .
on the other hand , we are very concerned about a repetition of the events we saw in the past with the ban on imports of pelts from seal pups , when the Greenland trappers were left to suffer the effects of the ban , which had serious social consequences in Greenland .
we are proposing that this be done on a voluntary basis , but this voluntary basis will , without doubt , have to be formalised as a genuine response to the problems .
I have therefore voted accordingly .
it is also inevitable that we would direct our attention not just to this programme of work and the lessons to be learned from it , but also to the way in which that programme of work now affects efforts to improve Europe &apos;s competitiveness .
dates for next sittings : see Minutes
I believe that we have also now succeeded in finding a way of citing this principle in a more precise and clear manner , given our obligations under the Treaty on European Union and international agreements and conventions .
we are talking about criteria that apply to all the Member States , both large and small , to the benefit of all the countries of the Union .
in writing . - ( LT ) The tragic events that occurred last month in Japan and concern over the safety of the Fukushima power plant have led to much discussion of nuclear power plants .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we should vote in favour of this agreement , as a sign of encouragement , as a positive bet on the future , and also as a means of keeping up pressure whenever negotiations take place regarding application or renewal .
in writing . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted for the Schlyter report on amending the Council directive as regards restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations .
it is my view that , as European citizens , it is our right to have the Treaties protect the environment .
I would like to refer to one of these amendments which I believe to be very important for Parliament and for the other European institutions .
farmers and politicians fought hard for this position .
the report requires Member States to ensure that manufacturers design appliances in such a way that spent batteries and accumulators can be readily removed , and that appliances be accompanied by instructions containing consumer information .
the management control system is making progress , and we only hope that it will be extended and deepened .
I took note of various amendments concerning the labelling of origin or other conditions applicable to raw materials .
.
we can try to add to the list the remaining Members wishing to speak , but I can tell you very honestly that it is impossible to have so many speakers ; I have about 30 .
within the context of the forthcoming human rights dialogue , it has also been proposed that the next field visit in China should go to Tibet .
the complex implementation of the Galileo , SES and ETS programmes as soon as possible would also promote the efficient use of fuels .
nine : due to the rapid advances and changes in these technologies , we must study questions of budget , technological infrastructure and educational continuity .
the number and size of these funds is currently growing rapidly .
- ( FR ) We voted against the report by Mr Gil-Robles Gil Delgado and Mr Tsatsos , which develops a strategy of &apos; encircling &apos; the Intergovernmental Conference seeking to oblige national government representatives to more or less ratify the conclusions of the Convention .
this is good .
I think it is something which will help create greater openness about the Commission &apos; s work .
and we need , in some cases , to create a better balance between our multilateral agenda and the bilateral agenda .
last Thursday , my group brought together in Brussels , to discuss the future of Mr Bolkestein ’ s symbolic text , more than 200 social actors from throughout the Union , from the confederal secretary of the European Trade Union Confederation to the representatives of the social forum from Poland and Romania , in addition to a large number of local , regional and national elected representatives .
this is a position we cannot justify to our taxpayers .
- Bericht : Zatloukal
that aside , it looks as though we can certainly reach an agreement fairly soon .
as regards fundamentals , I fear that this may be an apparent simplification , which will in practice result in confusions and complications for the actual users of the treaty , who are the national administrations , professionals , etc ..
I am quite sure that the recognition of agriculture as a strategic sector will make it possible to create better conditions for the implementation of aid and information programmes .
the use of stem cells from one &apos; s own body or if necessary from residual embryos , is defensible .
well , ladies and gentlemen , today , one day after the removal of the quota measures imposed on textile imports from China , that Commissioner ’ s prophesy has come true .
the Chinese have other definitions .
and then there is another attitude - the attitude of certain Members who would like to delay the proceedings , even for such an important debate as this .
that being so , the conditions for the participation of Hungary , the Czech Republic and Romania seem to be in place : those countries have given notice of their intent , and they have produced the necessary funding .
I believe we have to reconsider as a House the use of former Members of the European Parliament in such delegations .
I hope that the Commission will give this proposal support and follow it up .
harmonisation in this sector is quite simply impossible .
in the next stage , the manufacturers will commit to installing other safety equipment .
Mr Posselt , this correction is already on file and we shall confirm it when we reach that point .
the PACT programme is going to be extended to relate to short sea shipping and I hope that Mr Sindal will see that as evidence of our sustained commitment in the Commission to the development of that very important aspect of combined transport .
in that sense , it is an important part of the Lisbon process .
it seems to me that this is not the action of someone who is interested in reforming the system , it is the action of a hypocrite .
the guidelines for net financial corrections flow , in the Commission &apos;s view , from the existing provision of the main structural fund regulation and do not require any additional legal base .
China remains , by and large , the main source of unfair trade ( around 35 % of cases launched by the EU are against China ) .
so this is the fourth block of our negotiations which I see as problematic .
the first priority is the Neighbourhood Policy .
I also support the idea of a European equivalent of the FDA ( Food and Drugs Administration ) .
the solemn declaration of Cairo was signed by governments which are anything but generous regarding clearing debts and opening up their own markets .
I do not share their idealism .
after adopting the Treaty of Nice , we discovered that it would not function adequately if we had 25 or 28 Member States , and so we summoned a convention and compiled a draft Constitution , which you , Mr Blair , support .
we want to reduce bureaucracy , not increase it .
this unequivocal warning should condition all present agreements and should be included in all future agreements with Middle East governments .
we know there is room for improvement .
the European Council has therefore requested the Council of Ministers , the European Parliament and the Commission to draw up a new action plan for the period 2000 to 2004 .
nevertheless , as has already been said , the policy of blockade and isolation to which Cuba has been subjected by several western powers for decades has only toughened the position of the hard-line sectors of the regime .
5 . Sustainable mobility ( vote )
we are asking the European Commission to draw up a White Paper , following on from its Green Paper , so as to perform a review leading to a genuine strategy for the creative and cultural industries .
what , then , is the point of harping on all the time about something which is , obviously , a problem area ?
agenda for the next sitting : see Minutes
I would like to thank Ms Trautmann , who led the delegation to Rio and did it in a very good way .
I believe the report adequately deals with these issues and I voted in favour of Mr Brok &apos;s report .
the third energy package created the opportunity from a market perspective , and the climate package from a regulatory perspective , for newer investors and operators to enter the European energy market .
moreover , the common market for fisheries products calls for a harmonised minimum size .
this has not happened during this new parliamentary term .
the Commission is inclined to keep these transitional periods that have been adopted by many countries as short as possible ; indeed , for the Commission , it would have been much better if they had not been adopted .
high representatives of your home country then chimed in along the same lines , Commissioner .
the fact that we had 50 transfers and 10 supplementary and amending budgets in 2009 must make it obvious to everyone that the objectives of this budget , with its tight constraints and rigid structure , are clearly no longer up to date . We must all work together to change this if we want to do things better in future .
we have now set up a date with the Commission for six monthly assessments on work in progress .
the extension is thus essential and for that reason I support it , although I regret the delay in referring this protocol to Parliament for consideration .
it was absolutely crucial for the report to take age-based health inequalities into account , as it has now done .
the Committee on Transport wants to achieve a balance between attention to air quality on the one hand , and the free movement of goods on the other .
as to immigration policy , your document talks about &apos; an integrated approach to migration &apos; .
this report takes account of many concerns that are of crucial importance to farmers , such as assistance for small production , young farmers and combating price speculation .
if I am blind in Ireland , I am blind in Europe . &apos;
I would also like to hear your analysis , Mr Van Rompuy , as , if this double fear is unfounded , we really must banish it .
the reform should proceed as quickly as possible in order to avoid the demoralisation and destabilisation of the staff of the European public service .
Mr President , the Group of the European Radical Alliance agrees totally with the request submitted by the Green Group and Mr Lannoye , and we also agree with the reasons put forward .
secondly , bearing in mind that she and I will be at the global forum on internet governance next week , can she confirm that she will be joining us in promoting the virtues of competition on a global scale , in order to raise the level of broadband connection globally and reduce costs ?
for this reason it is , in my opinion , quite wrong for us at a time when we are confronted with the biggest famine in the second half of this century , to try to convince some people that this is just a matter of catastrophic flooding , periods of drought and the like .
however , Sri Lanka had no &apos; guardians &apos; , if we may call them such , in the Council , and so the decision was taken .
I rise today with a certain diffidence because I was hoping , as I am sure many colleagues were hoping , that we would be much further down the track of reaching peace in the Middle East .
Madam President , we are faced with one of those situations in which the average European citizen is likely to understand none of what we are saying or , worse still , to misunderstand and have a rather confused idea of how we regulate the Community &apos;s administration .
allow me to list a few of these additives .
we are in the middle of an exciting and demanding period in the history of Europe .
I would like to congratulate Mr Varela on his report on vessels flying non-Community flags that are non-contracting parties to NAFO , which was adopted unanimously .
we are currently looking at four agencies which reflect the fundamental problems of all the agencies , in other words , the overlap of responsibilities , for example , between the European Agency for Safety and Health ( OSHA ) and the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions ( Eurofound ) and between OSHA and the European Maritime Safety Agency ( EMSA ) , the European Railway Agency ( ERA ) and the European Aviation Safety Agency ( EASA ) .
what does that have to do with the tragic situation in Zimbabwe under its President , Robert Mugabe , our topic of debate ?
in all events , a clear answer is required .
indeed , Europol &apos;s activities must consist of supporting and coordinating the fundamental , irreplaceable work of the various Member States &apos; police forces .
the majority of votes cast were for Mr Diamandouros , who is therefore elected European Ombudsman .
every other Irish national advisory committee involved in the EC programme has a broad representation from all interested parties and has 12 to 16 members .
the text , which was adopted by a large majority , provides for patients to be reimbursed for the treatment they receive in another Member State .
on this point he would be following the approach initiated to a certain degree by President Borrell , who has attempted to advance the idea of an autonomous Parliament , with varying degrees of support from his troops .
the rules on administrative and judicial assistance are disappointing .
it is also called upon to correlate any such initiative with the work of the World Bank group and other multilateral development organisations .
in other words appropriate control mechanisms are needed to manage this aid effectively .
Article 206 of the EC Treaty , on which our approach is based , had even been forgotten by one or two of the officials in our own administration .
in writing . - I and my Labour colleagues strongly support the work of the rapporteur Edward Scicluna .
Mr President , in December 2002 the Fisheries Council agreed a compromise which effectively halved catches for the Scottish and UK whitefish fleets and stopped vessels going to sea for more than 15 days a month .
that will naturally be done .
I think that the Europe that we want to build is a Europe of solidarity , not a first-class and second-class Europe , but a Europe with which all Europeans can identify .
European legislation is unsuitable as a means to address the causes of bullying and is likely to be ineffective .
once again , I wish to express how baffled I am at the method used for producing the budget and especially , for this second reading , at the manner in which our dialogue was held with the Council during November .
I therefore call upon the Commission and the Council to ensure , in the management of this extremely complex process , that the balance is maintained between the regional dimension of the Pact and the bilateral Association and Stabilisation Agreements , or we may end up sending contradictory signals to these countries .
it is evident that not all the Member States of the European Union will be ready for that deadline .
furthermore , it is worth saying that it is the only policy which is extremely complicated in terms of putting it into effect , because it is based on a common administration which is shared with the Member States .
I would like to end by thanking all the members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs for their significant cooperation and I must finally acknowledge that I do not accept some of the amendments proposed by my own group for the reasons I have just given .
I therefore voted against the Karas report .
the differences have been made clear for example during the Vietnam War , over the South African boycott , concerning Turkey , the Balkans , nuclear weapon policy and so on . To create a sham agreement in these circumstances can only mean that the voices of the smaller Member States will be hushed , they will be outvoted , and some countries will be turned into satellites of the super powers .
the difficulty in terms of financial control is that of organizing this diversity in order to arrive at a standard method which is simple and efficient .
it is the financial situation which dictates future development .
the Internet helps counterfeiters , who can use it to market faked or imitation products around the world without any loss of time ; it is evident that their schemes are increasingly tied in with organised crime , and I have to say that the number of products that have had to be taken off the internal market has recently increased to a disturbing degree , being , as a rule , faked versions of other products , so action to address the problem of counterfeit goods is of the utmost importance to the Community , and the vote here in your House is an important step in getting it underway .
we mention these things because we want to carry out liberalisation in the interests of our citizens , with a careful eye and social awareness .
our libraries offer the advantage of already being coordinated at European level through the TEL , the European library that was set up in 2005 by the national libraries , which holds a large stock of digital works that are in the public domain and therefore can be used immediately .
we propose to improve the framework conditions for job creation , especially in fast-moving and R &amp; D-intensive sectors , by reducing the administrative burden and taxes on labour , and by helping entrepreneurs .
the European Union is , without doubt , the only political power capable of convincing the Cubans that the isolation in which they are confining themselves is suicidal and can only lead them , sooner or later , to a tragic fate .
this results in their sale and export abroad as slaves .
these being regulations , Parliament is very closely involved in both procedures under the codecision procedure .
during the past year , positive processes have been initiated in the country with the release of political prisoners , but we see that this process has since come to a standstill .
in 32 cases , operation of these installations was halted .
our group has provided you with fair , objective and positive support ; I hope that you share this impression , because this is our shared Europe and a success for Europe is a success for us all .
I took part in this delegation as a member of the Committee on Development and Cooperation , and one of the major topics in Johannesburg was of course the way in which development is financed .
the quarterly ‘ monetary dialogue ’ with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and our visits to Frankfurt deserve to be given wider public exposure .
it is an essential and important step in enabling victims to reside or stay wherever they want in the EU and thereby be included in the freedom of movement .
I call on the Commission and Member States to take the necessary measures to make social Europe a reality .
I am also getting rather tired of the fact that - not for the first time - we are being used as a ping pong ball between the PPE-DE and the PSE on these matters .
I want to congratulate the evaluation team , led by Dr Carlos Moreira , not only for the exacting work carried out in a short space of time , but also because it did not just fulfil its inspection role , it also frequently suggested measures and solutions allowing the problems identified to be solved .
I must recall that , at its initiative , surveillance over employment was set up back in 1995 .
. ( PT ) The creation of information-sharing systems from various civil aviation authorities &apos; reporting systems will enable all the actors involved to collate information about their errors and to produce a safer system for all air transport users .
Tanzania has 150 000 inhabitants who , due to a shortage of the colour pigment melanin , have red eyes , pale skin and fair hair .
and the Council has reduced funds to cofinance the trans-European transport and energy network by 15 million .
they are told that it is safe to settle in countries such as Iraq , Iran , Afghanistan , Congo and Burundi , although such countries are deemed by the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office or US State Department as being dangerous for Western visitors and / or in breach of fundamental rights .
according to the Commission proposal , both the fishermen serving on board and the owners of vessels should receive compensation .
we have another view of animal foods and the conditions under which animals are kept and transported .
it is outrageous for them to be imposed on us by a court .
are they sustainable ?
would the President-in-Office like to comment on the fact that even if it were not for the single currency there was a need for consolidation of the European economies , given the fact that we are now competing in a global environment , in particular in those countries which have weaker economies and could be most at risk as a result of globalization ?
the Commission has in fact initiated infringement procedures in the past year against 22 Member States that have not implemented the European regulations properly , including Italy , Mr Agnoletto .
Mr President , another important point is 112 , caller location .
among the many others , the most important point is the budget , which is undoubtedly the only and most important tool for constructing the delicate balance between consolidation of the public accounts and the need to support growth .
therefore , Mr President , it is clear that anything which helps to improve the preparation and knowledge of the Commission officials will be an important element for the European Union &apos; s external action .
the next item is Question Time to the Council ( B4-566 / 96 ) .
( Parliament approved the request for urgent procedure )
thirdly , any legislation must not disadvantage European industry or hinder developments in this area .
against this background I perceive the Banking Supervision Committee as the main forum in which multilateral cooperation amongst banking supervisors can be enhanced .
and to what extent has collaboration between you and the relevant Commissioner brought about concrete results and created some sort of framework strategy as to how you and the Commissioner hope this system will prove truly efficient ?
we propose to test a minimum number of 65 000 animals per year in the whole Community , and the testing will start in January 2001 .
in Berlin , in the large building that once housed what the Democratic Republic of Germany called its Parliament , is inscribed the word , which means doubts .
the credibility of the Belarusian authorities would be won if investigations carried out in line with international standards , with international experts , were to start right away .
the issue of European identity , too , has been examined from various starting points .
the European Union , and also Romania , as a member of the Union , must change the status of observers to full member status .
road safety must be a priority .
in discussing this report we are in fact talking about the increasingly insecure nature of female employment , the lack of services to facilitate women &apos;s integration into the labour market and the failure of both national and Community policies to promote equality through concrete and effective measures .
however , the problem is the provision of data by Member States .
President Papadopoulos &apos;s statements after the end of the talks in Switzerland amount to the fundamental rejection of the basic principles set out in the plan .
to be paid too late for work already done , especially outside Europe , spells the end for small and medium-sized firms , which is why my group endorses and supports a directive on payment periods , as referred to in Mr Harrison &apos;s report .
and during the next part-session , in Strasbourg , we shall also be inviting a party of Basque councillors .
a branch to the north of this axis will go , via Curtici and Brasov , to Bucharest and Constanza .
statistics ignore the situation .
in my view , this responsibility was a positive element and I regret that it has been amended .
in the most important area , however - in other words , in the area associated with the increase in the powers of the European Parliament following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon - we have got as far as a working group , which will establish the extra costs that may be associated with this .
Europe must be modernised , made more entrepreneurial in spirit and adapted in such a way that it becomes a more competitive environment for consumers and companies .
question No 5 by Camilo Nogueira Román ( H-0275 / 02 ) :
I believe that this is the fundamental message we can offer you .
at least as far as Finland is concerned , considerations of defence and historical factors make the two incompatible in practical terms , let alone desirable .
we have asked the Commission on more than one occasion to supply information on the practical effects of their proposals , they have not so done .
this laborious procedure , whereby the Commission prepares something , the Council &apos;s assent is then required and then at length we in this House have a say in the matter , is one that I do not regard as efficient .
the Commission also fully supports your proposal that information distributed by the Union should highlight common European values , namely democracy , pluralism , security , solidarity , equal opportunities , cohesion and so on . The objective is indeed , Mr Bayona , to show citizens the practical advantages in their daily lives of belonging to the Union .
my duty is simply to apply the Rules of Procedure .
it is a fairly simple rule that hunger and frustration lead to aggression , and aggression is the food on which terrorism , and possibly even a potential war , thrives .
it is clear that in some countries , elections are coming up , and so on , but after the volcanic eruption , all the decisions made were based on existing and agreed models on how to handle these kinds of situation .
it is a rather complex issue and needs good cooperation between all parties involved .
there will be no let up in the efforts to consolidate the budget in order to reduce the public debt .
the same can be said of the French government which , in its note of 9 May , sees no difficulty about using Article 308 in such a case .
in saying this , I am not moving away from the subject that we are dealing with this evening , because sweet products , whether or not they contain sweeteners , are interdependent .
you may have the floor , but only if it is on a different matter .
Mr President , you have taken the votes rather quickly .
not bad either is the 11 p.m. slot for an issue that is of great interest and concerns millions of citizens in Europe .
question No 31 by Brian Crowley ( H-1216 / 98 ) Subject : The Community school-milk programme
rest assured that the French Presidency will scrupulously adhere to such provisions .
America will have a new president next week ; and we all have major challenges ahead of us .
in spite of the fact that the Member States already have this obligation under the Århus Convention , the Commission approves the Amendment .
the current practice places workers from the new Member States at a distinct disadvantage .
to ensure that this competitiveness is maintained we need to establish market access conditions that are fair , equitable and reciprocal .
in writing . - ( PT ) This proposal should be in line with the reasons behind the 6th Environment Action Programme with the aim of applying current knowledge of prospective and retrospective strategies for assessing the risks and dangers to humans and the environment and to create coherency with other policies .
there are good grounds , however , for many small and medium-sized cities to receive regional aid , especially if it is a component of broader-scope regional development programmes .
and if it is to be found at the centre of society then it is up to this Parliament , to every Member of this House , but also to every citizen of the European Union not to turn a blind eye and a deaf ear to the phenomenon of ethnic hatred and xenophobia , anti-semitism and rabble-rousing but to oppose it actively , to have the courage to stand up for their beliefs and to protect people .
I therefore believe that in keeping with this decision of the Court of Human Rights , the Commission must quickly take a new initiative , a directive that not only restricts noise in the vicinity of airports , but lays down standards on noise exposure , thus allowing for harmony within the European Union .
we would like the World Bank to invest in renewable energy and increased energy efficiency , but we must always bear in mind the fundamental goal , or , in other words , how access to energy is supposed to help people break out of poverty .
contrary to all environmental logic , France , which wants to create a lower excise duty , is finding itself thwarted by the European Commission .
I should have started with the apologies of my colleague , Commissioner McCreevy .
firstly , how can we learn from our differences , so that the European Union can find itself again at last , and can speak with a united voice in international affairs ?
although the system is the most used of the industrialised countries &apos; systems , I agree that we need to review the regulation in question so as to simplify the application of the scheme .
nevertheless , and bearing in mind the differences of opinion between the previous government and the election-winners on a whole range of issues , such as the Status Law , social dialogue and public procurement for example , the possibility of changes in Hungary &apos;s position on the accession process cannot be excluded , although I do not believe that they will jeopardise this process .
in my view , these proposals will need a reality check when the overall EU budget is determined some time next year .
the issue will need to be examined at the Conference of Presidents .
I would have liked us to have had a position that we all agreed on in order to be better placed to enter into negotiations with the Council .
what is effective is if , in the context of joint protection of the coast , synergies can be recognised and , through a joint organisation , people and materials be aligned with each other and the best possible use made of them across the countries and seas of the region .
the poor regions will simply be less poor than some of those due to become part of the European Union .
let us not forget that in 1989-90 it was the people of the states of central and eastern Europe who by their desire for freedom , their struggle for democracy , their desire for a market economy made possible the change in our continent , and we must not disappoint these people , who engendered the peaceful revolution in Europe , by the decision which we take now .
Mr President , Commissioner , critical though I may be of individual aspects of Europe ’ s Constitutional Treaty , it does strike me as important that the common foreign and security policy be strengthened .
and so , already problematic as applied to fifteen countries , in line with the principles of subsidiarity , financial solidarity , Community preference and market unity , the CAP will be substantially weakened as a result of enlargement , and the effect of this will not be on the Community agricultural sector alone , it will have negative implications for agricultural workers in the CCEEs who are therefore likely to migrate to the more profitable agricultural sector .
Commission .
the Greenland authorities have committed themselves to restructuring their fisheries sector towards more privatisation and fewer subsidies .
we have come a long way since the fraud and mismanagement report of the Commission which led to its resignation in 1999 , but there is still much work to do .
as the report takes this into account , I have voted in favour of it .
Mr President , this debate was very timely and it has provided me with food for thought for the EU-China summit in Helsinki .
the report includes recommendations in the area of energy infrastructure , the development of towns and buildings , information and communications products , tenders and financing .
furthermore , safety on board ship must also involve the adequate training of crew in the sector .
I wanted this regulation to remain sufficiently general so that its application would not be hindered by defining the principles of organic stock raising without entering into very detailed specifications .
the message is therefore clear : ‘ yes ’ to Europe , including an enlarged Europe , but ‘ no ’ to the liberal direction it is taking .
in the Russian Federation there are 19 different nations of the Finno-Ugric family , totalling 2.7 million persons .
it is up to all of us now - and we can take this as an invitation - to initiate a directive that keeps red tape to a minimum while matching our aspirations .
to include these businesses under the heading of SMEs is , to my mind , going too far .
Mumbai is a good example of how it does not work .
this goes against the previous policy of the Palestinian police , and is a means of showing full respect for the teaching attributed to Mohammed , which says that in order to distinguish yourself from the infidels you should let your beard grow and clip your moustache .
I would like to illustrate certain problems with this Regulation by showing you a small object .
I am well aware that , on such occasions , one should speak of hope and of the human qualities that can lead us to the triumph of compassion and fraternity between people .
they are the only ones who cannot harbour dreams of dual citizenship .
thirdly , I shall comment on the energy policy .
also worthy of note is the proposal to set up a Community classification of tourist services , on a voluntary basis and with the industry ’ s cooperation , to be used in particular for the classification of hotel and restaurant facilities .
in writing . - ( LT ) I welcomed this document , because it recommends that the urban dimension of cohesion policy should focus on a threefold objective : firstly , to help urban areas develop their basic physical infrastructure as a precondition for growth in order fully to exploit their potential contribution to economic growth in Europe , diversification of the economic base and energy and environmental sustainability , in particular with a view to maintaining and improving air quality in urban centres , without detriment to rivers ; secondly , to help urban areas modernise their economic , social and environmental characteristics through smart investment in infrastructure and services based on technological advancements and closely related to specific regional , local and national requirements ; thirdly , to regenerate urban areas by reclaiming industrial sites and contaminated land , while bearing in mind the need for links between urban and rural areas with a view to promoting inclusive development , in line with the Europe 2020 strategy . Urban areas are not isolated elements within their regions and their development must therefore be closely linked to the surrounding functional , suburban or rural areas .
our task is precisely that of explaining , of bridging the gap , but we cannot allow proposals to be less precisely worded .
finally , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs Estrela , for her persistence in defending measures which are aimed at protecting families , whilst also counteracting the ageing of the population .
at best we can ask whether , with a view of the proposed solutions , the basic competition conditions are fair or not . We must discuss whether this makes sense for the future of agriculture .
we can and must fan that spark into a blaze of confidence , action and tangible results .
failure will mean that protectionism will fill the vacuum as momentum towards wide-ranging reduction of barriers ceases ; the world economy will slow down and global trade imbalances will continue to rise ; financial markets will become more unstable ; and international economic cooperation will break down further .
we take note of Parliament &apos;s motion for a resolution regarding the individual case of Mr Troy Davis .
Mr President , Commissioners , have no fear , I am neither a fisherwoman nor a farmer .
in the expectation of the second reading stage bringing us closer to a solution to the controversial areas of protection of intellectual property and the temporary approval of substances and imported items that will take into account the interests of all parties , I have today , in the final vote , voted in favour of the REACH draft .
the introduction of the euro will have as much effect on those countries which remain outside the project as those which go in the first wave .
I , personally , am actively involved in work to promote transplantation , and I encourage all fellow Members to do the same .
the American anti-missile defence is presented to us as a defence shield , so why was the Czech Republic , for example , not allowed to sell the Tamara passive radar detection system without active military components to China ?
Mr President , if we talk about the EU ’ s strategic and political guidelines , we will inevitably end up talking about Turkey .
a great deal has been said today , either directly or indirectly , about the stance adopted towards Austria .
so an end to hypocrisy on the part of society , the state and individuals .
Mr. President , it is with a sense of disappointment and sadness that I have read this report and listened to the various speeches .
lastly , Madam President , guaranteeing equal access to transplants for all those who need and qualify for one under harmonised clinical criteria , obeying the principle of universal access to health : a paradigm of social Europe of which we are proud .
taking the latter point first , I argue in the way I do because existing legislation no longer meets the consumers &apos; needs .
last month , we asked to no avail the diplomatic representatives of China in Brussels , Mr Huang Daosheng , Mr Wang Wen and Mr Wei Min , to provide us with documented evidence disproving such ongoing horror .
we get the impression that this proposal will still be excluded from the agenda or systematically blocked within the Council .
as Mr Galeote has said , disputes have arisen , and are arising , in Belgium , France , Italy , Spain , Portugal and the United Kingdom , and infringement procedures are under way in Denmark , Germany and Holland .
unless otherwise agreed , tariff elimination is to take place through equal steps beginning on 1 July 1997 , for completion by 1 January 2000 .
in the Dutch parliament , we asked the government to reject this document in the Council .
effective administration must be able to provide the institutions responsible with the elements for analysis and decision and amongst these elements is the cost-efficiency index .
at the heart of this House &apos;s demands , of course , is that governments should cooperate with each other on this .
by taking over the joint presidency of the conference , the EU also illustrated its commitment effectively .
unfortunately , this involves a significant reduction in appropriations .
yet we should have expectations of a democratic country based on the rule of law .
we must confront the threat of climate change , and we must arrange a secure , sustainable energy supply .
Madam President , I too would like to welcome this report .
it confirms that we were right in the decision that we took .
unfortunately , assisting spouses do not form a large and united target group , their status is not regulated in any Member States and their work is not recognised .
I would like to thank the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee and especially the rapporteur , Mrs Peijs , for their judicious and efficient handling of this file .
Mr President , I am speaking briefly to justify my abstention .
this means that our nations must seek their sovereignty and identity within a new Europe , the Europe of nations .
( PL ) Mr President , about 1 900 people are being held under arrest in very poor conditions for expressing their support for the introduction of democracy in Burma .
( SK ) Mr President , industrial policy must , as part of economic policy , aim for sustainable growth , higher employment and a decent quality of life for all Europeans .
but we cannot simply ban imports of must .
FAS warnings on alcohol products , similar to those in the USA , combined with a public health education campaign are an effective way of warning of the impact of drinking while pregnant .
this represents an enormous responsibility for the Socialists in the European Parliament , and an expectation of new proposals .
we agreed a resolution on serious illicit drug trafficking .
of course Farai Maguwu , who was exercising his fundamental right to free speech , should be released from detention immediately .
it demonstrates how we can introduce the new technology of genetic modification .
unfortunately , on 20 December , Juan Miguel Gervilla , a police officer in Barcelona , was killed by terrorists .
Mr President , Mr Lamassoure &apos;s report reminds me of the film on the TV channel Arte about the &apos; European bubble &apos; and the &apos; Europe addicts &apos; .
I would like to see the European Union play a more active role in the organisation of film distribution .
however , I want to point out again at this juncture that instilling awareness in minors themselves , as well as their parents and educators , is still the best way forward .
instead , he should spend a bit less time skirt-chasing and get to work sending all these immigrants back to Africa .
I am rather shocked by the view of the rapporteur , who appears to choose an opt-out which will only free consumers from the inconvenience after they have expressly lodged their protests .
what can we say about the skulduggery surrounding the construction of the International Congress Centre in Brussels and , even more so - in fact much more so - the construction of the large &apos; object &apos; just a short distance away from here , which may one day end up being our headquarters ?
as we all know , the EU &apos;s relations with Libya concern various aspects of how refugees should be treated .
I am glad of the opportunity to reiterate my view that the Scientific Steering Committee is , as you describe it , the top of the pyramid .
this advance , which is reflected in enhanced credibility and quality , simultaneously requires European tourism operators and government bodies to assume new responsibilities .
we shall be voting on several proposals which might represent a certain amount of progress .
the report itself , although it is very much lacking in some areas , is highly critical of the Spanish authorities , and in particular of the statements made by Spanish leaders and of the failure to make the conclusions of the investigations more widely known .
Commissioner , all these speeches have the same theme .
the memorandum of understanding has given our textile and clothing industry additional time to prepare for the challenges it faces .
if we abandon the heart of asylum policy , we jeopardise human rights and take an axe to the pillars supporting that community of values that is the European Union .
certainly in Scotland that has been a bone of contention .
the report says that unemployment is too high .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I am one of those people who championed the irrelevant amendments in committee .
the move to strengthen policing at the European level via uncontrolled mechanisms , the attempt to exert joint control over the Union &apos;s foreign receipts and the unification of the policy approach on immigration matters , in particular the formulation of common rules for the deportation of citizens of third countries , constitute a further erosion of the sovereign rights of the Member States and are detrimental to the democratic links and friendly relations which many of them maintain with movements which are progressive and concerned for peace .
one of the key points on this list was the strengthening of police and judicial cooperation .
the European Union &apos;s foreign policy appears to be poorly thought-out and poorly coordinated .
but I say quite clearly at this point that , if you signal that you are not prepared to cooperate with us and that we are on course for a confrontation , then this Parliament is not defenceless or powerless and we shall use our powers for the people who place their hopes in us and we shall certainly not disappoint them .
can far-reaching reforms be carried out in a post-communist country without that promise ?
he criticised the fact that we are leading the Union into military ventures and mentioned , by way of example , the operation we have begun in the Democratic Republic of the Congo .
secondly , it is true that a policy of preserving the marine environment must be practised both in Community seas and in international waters or those belonging to third countries .
since then , too many people have taken risks , risks for which the price is paid in the longer or shorter term .
we need to think that one through .
I would also like to extend those thanks to the advisors of the parliamentary secretariats and , of course , our own staff .
that is why , today , no Arab regime supports Washington &apos;s position .
we therefore call on the Member States to take young people into account in all relevant policy sectors .
we will therefore , as a first step , organise a meeting on post-shipment controls where we will be briefed by the US authorities on their experiences with post-shipment control programmes .
it is time to engage and to help entrepreneurs in developing countries rather than to over-politicise the issue .
let us not forget Beijing .
Madam , I would just like to mention that my name is not included in the list of those present .
let me also say that getting through this economic crisis and putting Europe back on the path towards sustainable growth will also require respect for Community rules on equal opportunities .
the Court of Justice of the European Communities will be called upon to plug the loopholes by creating , as it has done in other sectors , liberal case law which favours undertakings on the pretext of completing the internal market .
secondly , the European Union would do well to delve deeper into the issue of discrimination in job evaluation .
it is the opinion of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party that the European Parliament for its own part should support their adoption .
although this motion for a resolution has good intentions to protect European citizens , the inappropriate use of these important data cannot ultimately be ruled out .
what is certain is that the political will for them to succeed is there .
I want to emphasise what I believe is the real challenge which will face you and your colleagues when you sit down at the end of this month to discuss the presidency &apos;s proposal : namely how to change our whole attitude and thinking about entrepreneurship , about encouraging people to go out and start the new businesses that we now acknowledge are the engines of the new economy .
they are unsatisfactory for several reasons .
the objective at hand is to set up a joint undertaking charged with managing a technological research and development programme .
in my own region of Yorkshire and the Humber , many thousands of people were affected and many are still unable to return to their properties .
the staff in women &apos;s prison should be women as far as possible , including medical staff .
it would discourage tax fraud and evasion to the competitive advantage of tax compliant businesses and reduce pressure on governments to lower corporate tax rates which shifts the tax burden onto workers and low-income households while forcing cutbacks in public services Any European agreement on Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base has to have regard to the needs of geographically marginal regions of the EU such as Ireland and their capacity to attract FDI .
the suffering of women cannot be treated with indifference , and we must support them because their revolt will be at the root of many geopolitical trends in favour of the ideals promoted by the European Union , notably gender equality .
I recall that this matter was subject to a simplified legislative procedure so as to speed it up .
I think that a positive outcome of today &apos; s debate would be to reach agreement with the British in recognising that this must be one of our main priorities .
the current text actually provides for the possibility of looking at the issue again in 2011 .
but that is not to be naive and to say that we do not need to have resources at our disposal .
furthermore , we support the earliest possible establishment of &apos; open skies &apos; , which will represent further liberalisation of transatlantic air transport and a new stage in relations between the European Union and the United States which will benefit people on both sides of the Atlantic .
having propped up their banks with tens of billions of euros in aid , several Member State governments have now decided to support the motor vehicle industry .
this review may result in the Commission making a legislative proposal in line with its right of legislative initiative in the treaties .
can we be assured that even when the treaties are signed there will be no winding down of DG Enlargement ?
in line with this political aim , the Council is willing to contribute to the process and help to create a climate of trust between the parties concerned .
the report on the subject from our fellow Members who were there as observers is revealing .
the Commission &apos;s proposal represents the first step towards a tax trade-off from labour to energy through the introduction of minimum levels of taxation .
this is excellent , of course , but there is scope for many more programmes with signing .
memoranda like the one the troika of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) and the Commission drew up with Portuguese officials demanded anti-social policies , including amendments to redundancy and privatisation laws , and attacks on public and universal social security which can only lead to social regression , condemning workers and the public to unemployment , poverty , underdevelopment and extreme dependency .
furthermore , a large proportion of refugees and asylum-seekers coming to Britain and other European countries originate from Afghanistan .
you are aware that there is a working document by the Bureau to discuss this subject .
the old Suharto regime has in the past forced more than 8 million Indonesians to move from overpopulated regions to regions with a low population rate .
the next stage will be amendment of origin protocols in the current bilateral association agreements in order to insert the changes necessary for the application of diagonal accumulation .
one of the important elements coming out of Madrid was the idea of common uniform employment indicators .
the situation must therefore be judged differently from area to area , from community to community .
secondly , an immediate revision would make things much more complicated as regards progress in respect of the other pending dossiers in this field like European company statutes and the national information and consultation proposal .
perhaps we should remember 30 August 1954 when a European Union of defence became impossible .
in view of the considerable diversity of bodies of groundwater in Europe , precise objectives can only be set at local level .
we can use the tools available to us and , with that in view , the possibility is being examined of instituting a consultancy procedure with regard to Liberia in application of Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement .
.
in the White Paper before us , you promise that details of these bodies will be published by the end of the year .
lastly can I say , because I say it every time I get a chance , European City Guides needs to be addressed , and I hope it will be .
that will not always produce the solution but we certainly have an obligation to find that common position .
the so-called &apos; liberalization &apos; favoured by Blair &apos;s right wing caucus has hit the rock of French immoveability in relation to energy production in the domestic sector , so it remains the case that Electricité de France can take over companies outside France while protected from converse interventions .
on the contrary . We cannot , however , accept its impairing our long-term efforts to combat poverty .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Prodi , yours is a difficult task , but at the same time you have it easy : it is difficult because of the challenges with which the European Union will be faced in the next five years , and easy because Parliament , the Council and the European public have never before shown such strong support for a new beginning in the Commission .
of course , when part of the risk is underwritten by public-sector bodies , there is still a chance that banks will offer loans to small and medium-sized enterprises .
this constitutes a logical continuation of the 2002 initiatives and we expect and hope that women &apos;s associations will submit sound proposals in response to this call .
I also agree that the Commission &apos;s proposal , in its explanatory statement , should include clear and detailed information on the application , analysing the eligibility criteria and explaining the reasons that led to its approval , in accordance with the requests made by Parliament .
Mr President , I will conclude by saying two things : the first is that we fully support the Declaration on the Middle East , and the second is that my Group does not understand why Ecofin can do more than the European Council in terms of creating a Euro-Mediterranean Bank .
since then , the town has become the rock capital of Sweden !
my name has been put on various lists and the spam comes in .
you said , &apos; Les dégâts n &apos;ont pas été considérables , &apos; and yet Commissioner Ferrero Waldner has given us the figures and this House will be called on to agree to pay the bill !
although buildings , in particular , do , in fact , form part of the cultural heritage , they are in a bad state of repair in many areas .
it is precisely this trade in services that several people have made out to be problematic , but this is clearly one of the most important strategic areas we have , particularly when it comes to financial services .
meeting these commitments on time is vital for the European Union &apos;s credibility .
with regard to our relations with the United States , I think it would be useful for President Bush to come here , but we must also talk to the US Congress . About this , about the International Criminal Court and compliance with the application of WTO Panel decisions and resolutions on such important subjects as the Foreign Sales Act .
yet around the negotiating table I only see men with beards , some longer , some shorter , but I have not seen any of those fantastic women we have met any more .
the principles of subsidiarity and of proportionality are fundamental guidelines for action by the institutions in their exercise of EU competences and hence an integral part of better lawmaking .
a more general consideration comes to mind in this context , however .
the budget is , indeed , the basic , fundamental tool that supports all EU policies - common agricultural policy , cohesion policy , research policy and foreign policy .
adults need to connect learning to their knowledge , experience and cultural background .
besides , it is a pilot programme and we need to see how it progresses .
I think that one effect of what happened at the beginning of January has been to push energy policy up our list of priorities .
the financial transaction tax is the result of a citizens &apos; initiative that is driving this proposal , which is essentially based on the Tobin tax , and Parliament &apos;s position on the matter will therefore be decisive .
Mr Maat ’ s report has been approved unanimously in the Committee on Fisheries and has restored calm .
but the European Union must take further steps to promote and protect the dignity and human rights of women both here and throughout the world .
I believe we should make it a priority to answer these two questions , and that if we did so we would discover that emergency measures have often been mistaken and that the lists of terrorist organisations have been imprecise , often dictated more by political motives than a real danger posed by the organisations .
conditionality was one of the main discussion points and , as regards the European Social Fund , the situation described by Mrs Göncz is being covered , and we would like to develop conditionality in that sense .
I believe the funds need to be reformed and I also consider that they should be reformed in the manner that I have suggested , that is to say that they should be brought closer to those who manage the money .
it should not be hostage to Burma , but that is what the ASEAN states are allowing to happen .
Scotland would be in a much better position to contribute to Europe &apos;s climate change objectives if we were full participants in the European Union as an independent Member State .
Madam President , now that Parliament has voted down Amendment No 443 , we have solved the problem .
I am particularly concerned because , in actual fact , this does nothing to enhance our reputation .
as many observers have noted , the number of victims could have been lower if the Government had reacted in a more coordinated manner to the typhoon .
you just do not get it , do you ?
this is not a reason , Mr Watson , it is simply a response to the issue of being a team player .
Mr President , I too would like to express my great appreciation for the work of Mrs Lalumière , who has produced an extraordinarily sound document which is also carefully thought out .
( EL ) Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Martín Fragueiro , the current common fisheries policy has failed .
lastly , I hope that the pensioners of Bulgaria , together with the younger generation , can build a better world together with all of us in the European Union .
numerous trade disputes between the EU and the US relate to the use of GMOs and meat hormones .
but I have no sympathy at all for giving unilateral support to women in paid employment , while at the same time discriminating against women who bring up their children themselves .
on that occasion it related to a matter that was also of concern to him personally , namely the Treaty of Lisbon .
the European Commission &apos;s proposal to create joint technology initiatives will harmonise and simplify project financing .
nobody should be in any doubt that the European Parliament will not give up on reform in China and , of course , in Tibet .
thank you for your reply , Commissioner Monti .
at present , this collection of data is carried out on a purely voluntary basis by 18 Member States for shipping , with collection of data by type of goods already mandatory for European road , rail and inland waterways transport statistics .
( RO ) I wish the Swedish Presidency every success and I believe that the priorities set out are those we have been expecting .
he said that when you play poker , you do not tell anyone what you have in your hand .
this would complement the immense public effort in the affected Member States and would give priority to repairing the serious damage with the objective of restoring living conditions and economic stability in these areas as soon as possible .
normal risks must largely be allowed for and managed by farmers and farm managers themselves on the basis of their business knowledge .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the situation in Palestine is becoming increasingly tense .
Mr President , the European Union has a seemingly limitless need to absorb more countries .
I believe that a well thought-out strategy is required for dealing with the human rights situation in Iran , and I wonder if we might perhaps draw on our experience from the period when we supported the Belorussian opposition by broadcasting to it from Europe in Belorussian .
not all of them were actually filled by the Commission or OLAF , but when it came to the 2001 budget the budgetary authority then decided to cut the number of grade A posts to fewer than there were officials in place .
it will need to be solved , but not at the cost of farmers who have tied themselves to tobacco production and incurred the relevant investment outlay .
they cannot seriously come from the CO2 tax as Mr Ripa di Meana and the Greens believe , because nobody has ever seen carbon dioxide produce taxes , otherwise Pinatubo would probably be spitting euros . So there is only one resource left : a European income tax .
however , I am opposed to a separate legal framework for the ESF .
we should really be looking at what remains inside the country .
concerning the other question , I would point out that one of the problems confronting us is that ECHO &apos;s ordinary budget is exhausted by half way through the year , and a whole series of unforeseen disasters compels us to engage in very lengthy and cumbersome procedures to mobilise the reserve .
the moral dimension of the fight against terrorism must not be neglected , as we must prevail there , too , if we want to succeed .
we cannot leave the Copenhagen European Council to decide on dozens and dozens of details .
therefore , the European institutions should enforce their own directives and broadcasters with a cross-border remit should be able to offer their services to the whole of their linguistic and cultural community when it , as in the case of Catalonia , extends beyond more than one single state .
the Convention was developed further after 1992 following the extensive political transformations which had occurred at that time .
if you stick to your time we can maximise the number of participants .
but now we have to complete the task of transition .
I now turn to the group of amendments suggesting that car tax differentiation should be based not only on carbon dioxide emissions but also on other pollutants – in particular amendments 1 , 2 , 7 , 8 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 21 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 30 and 36 . In principle the Commission encourages Member States to apply coordinated fiscal incentives under certain conditions – for example , to expedite the placing on the market of passenger cars satisfying future requirements .
what sort of contradictory statement is this ? One that is designed to please everyone and achieve nothing !
I represent those who do not believe that the Europarties make for greater democracy .
every country and region has its jewels and cultural heritage which it must protect as much as possible against earthquakes .
in fact , however , Euro 5 and Euro 6 motor vehicles will be introduced more quickly , because thanks to this Regulation the Member States have the opportunity to promote vehicles with Euro 5 and Euro 6 emissions standards before the 1 September 2009 through tax incentives .
that is why I am particularly satisfied that in the context of broader EU budgetary policies , the EU leaders are making provision to safeguard the viability of the common agricultural policy now and into the future .
the last European Council in Brussels made a great step in that direction .
continuing poverty is holding back this process through open trade .
I personally hope for a comprehensively satisfactory outcome to these negotiations as soon as possible .
in Palestine , groups such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad have grown powerful because people think that , in any case , agreement can never be reached with the occupying power , which is seizing ever more land for settlements and the construction of a wall .
my impression is that the British have lost the will to fight for the realisation of their vision of the European Union .
we wish to point out that , in the report , subsidies for withdrawing large vessels from the tuna fleet are described , and rightly so , as counterproductive and catastrophic , which is why it proposes that they be abolished and redirected towards renewing the fleet .
in writing . - Public oversight of bodies such as the IASCF / IASB is a controversial issue .
I think this ad hoc group gives us a good opportunity to cooperate with the Commission in seeing exactly what has been done with European taxpayers &apos; money .
irregularities were confirmed on as many as 43.6 % of the websites reviewed , which only confirms the necessity of greater monitoring in relation to the enforcement of existing provisions .
( the sitting was suspended at 3.25 p.m. and resumed at 6 p.m. )
what does that actually mean ?
( NL ) Madam President , whilst I should like to thank Commissioner Špidla for his pro-active stance in this matter , the scope of the silver economy market for services and products is left a little vague at the moment .
following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , both institutions need a formal agreement on reviews of expenditure to replace the 30-year-old &apos; gentlemen &apos;s agreement &apos; .
we wish to point out once again that in the interinstitutional agreement it was stipulated that information policy is an autonomous action which does not require a separate legal basis .
yet again , many thanks to Mrs Berès and to all those who have contributed to this report , and of course to those who have spoken today .
the EFICS has never utilised the available resources and there has not been an effort on the part of Member States to utilise the provisions of this regulation in the past .
there is mention of a radius of between 2.5 mm and 5 mm for corners , of retractable steps , of obvious markings on edges and even of hot drink vending machines and cooking equipment .
the majority of the cases of false declarations or undeclared work that are uncovered concern women .
furthermore , should we win the vote on this amendment - and as my colleague indicated , it was very close in committee - I trust that the Council and the Commission would respect the outcome and not carry out the threat made in committee by the Commissioner &apos;s services to go for a different procedure , in effect acting behind Parliament &apos;s back in seeking to persuade the Council to do something which , so I understand , it does not want to do anyway .
amendments Nos 18 , 29 and 31 would add additional requirements which the Commission cannot accept , because they are disproportionate to the proposed objective ; I am referring to burdens such as the compilation of statistics , lists of infringements and fines , and going further on certain aspects of road safety , not to mention the internal market .
that would be disastrous .
let me further stress that strict supervision , hence also the possibility of imposing sanctions , must go hand in hand with the implementation of the Protocol .
the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) will be voting in favour , but we will not be voting for the amendments which will be tabled , so as not to upset the delicate compromise which has been reached .
against this current backdrop , I have two questions I would like to put to Commissioner Rehn .
is anyone suggesting military intervention ?
lastly , we highlight the priority given to environmental issues .
these sentiments are also shared by those progressive voters who have voted in favour of the Constitution with some hesitation , in the belief that it was a step forward .
if we are to succeed in this , it is not enough for the developed world to reduce its emissions of greenhouse gases by 20 % .
the wrong signals are still being sent out to the young people of Europe when anyone can buy five grams of cannabis at a so-called coffee shop .
I am sure the Commission should also look at all the points made in your motion for a resolution with great interest and attention , but I would prefer to concentrate here on the two main headings of your report .
I imagine that this will take us back to the debate that we had last year on the situation in Ireland .
( Applause from the Left )
( Parliament approved the recommendation )
the EU is an area of solidarity , and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) is a part of that .
the EP is of the opinion that Member States should be given more time to investigate whether repealing the directives will lead to legal uncertainty which makes European harmonisation of rules necessary .
Mr President , the Middle East is the spiritual home of the three great revealed religions of the world , but sadly also the inspiration for those misguided few who invoke Islam as a justification for terrorist killings , invoking in particular the bloodthirsty traditions of Salafism and Wahhabism .
my mandate as Commissioner is the same as that adopted by the Council , and also by Parliament , moreover , in 1999 for Seattle .
this would help us to improve our structures because , in actual fact , if we are aware of real or alleged malfunctions , we will be able , not least as Members of the European Parliament , to take appropriate measures to address them .
drug tourism to Amsterdam is allowed to continue , and the Netherlands can go on exporting drug misuse to other countries .
in the previous cycle the European Parliament closed the first reading of the Reception Conditions Directive , and the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs is currently examining the Commission &apos;s proposal for the amendment of the Procedures Directive .
we are Members of Parliament and we represent European citizens with the same legitimacy that you represent yours !
that is my request .
in the Turkish part of Kurdistan , 3 185 villages have been cleared out during the past 14 years .
however , we have continued to make our position crystal clear .
the vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon .
in consequence it included the abolition of capital punishment among the thematic priorities of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights for the period 2002-2004 and allocated a specific budget of EUR 12 million to action in this area for the period 2000-2004 .
a further 116 000 have returned from Iran .
the next item is the continuation of the debate on the report ( A4-0299 / 98 ) by Mr Secchi , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy , on the proposal for a Council Directive on a common system of taxation applicable to interest and royalty payments made between associated companies of different Member States ( COM ( 98 ) 0067 - C4-0195 / 98-98 / 0087 ( CNS ) ) .
that is why we cannot accept this system .
with regard to fiscal policy acting as a discretionary element to improve growth in the short term , it might indeed serve as such in some cases , at least in theory .
I am unable to vote in favour of the report .
finally , I would also call for the EU strategy on Roma inclusion to be linked with the strategy for the Danube region .
I therefore believe that there is a clear need to develop Community legislation aimed at protecting the soil as such .
Mr President , five years ago , it was totally inconceivable that today , we would be talking about competition in the field of services but also , above all , competition in the field of infrastructure within Europe .
those who negotiate for us , those who buy energy out in the real world , need to invest , and businesses only invest when there is a reasonable degree of certainty .
in addition , we need a massive effort of training in order to raise the level of skills across the board in Europe &apos;s workforce .
9 . Ecodesign requirements for energy-using products ( vote )
I would be genuinely interested to hear your views on those points .
that is true , but it is true only of current demand levels .
Mr President , as you know , I am presenting this report , standing in for Mr Vecchi , who has had to leave for family reasons .
my second point concerns procedures for the future .
Mrs Neynsky stole the show by saying that the compromise states nothing at all about this .
we have an exciting time ahead of us .
I will try to integrate relevant elements of this report into the implementation of the new common Northern Dimension policy .
the quality of statistical governance lies at the heart of the crisis in the eurozone .
for this reason , greater legislative transparency is needed , particularly on copyright and consumer protection law and fiscal and labour law .
I hope that we are not restricting the discussion to them , and that your letter to Thailand does not set the limits for this , but that we are perfectly clear that developing countries which are not among the poorest also really need to be able to protect public health in order to be able to develop effectively , and that we must give them all the help and support we can .
( Loud applause )
( PL ) Madam President , listening to today &apos;s debate on the Seventh Framework Programme , I would like to take the opportunity to draw your attention to the preparations for the following programme , the Eighth Framework Programme .
I am very sorry for that because the Lisbon Treaty deserves visible protest .
as a result , 300 000 people have died and over 2.5 million have been displaced .
I believe that they can be held up as models to the other Member States of the European Union .
something concrete must be achieved in the short term .
it is always controversial when you are asked to give yourselves resources .
do we want as a European judge a man who has ruined the whole of the Belgian judicial machine ?
Mr President , Commissioner , strengthening the collective and individual rights of workers , especially in the context of mass redundancies , company transfers and insolvencies as a result of industrial change , is enshrined in directives that the Member States must respect , by transposing them swiftly and effectively into national legislation , which does not always happen , and on which the Commission must take special action .
everyone should be able to choose their own energy supplier , and everyone should be able to get their electricity from the generator of their choice ; if they could do that , it would give us a real chance of reshaping the European market .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , the Seventh WTO Ministerial Conference in Geneva was an important opportunity to exchange views with all WTO members on their priorities for the organisation .
finally - I am about to conclude , Mr President - I would like to mention our insistence on the application and implementation of measures that have already been announced , be it the Institute for Equality , the Centre on Violence or the full application of existing directives , so that we can make the emancipation of women and their personal and professional fulfilment the central goal of our initiative and the strategy itself .
the Commission promised that we would have the evaluations in March , then in April and then in May . So where have they got to ?
to be honest - as my fellow Member has already said -the government did hold these talks last year , but broke them off after the Olympic Games .
Mr President , I should merely like to answer Mr Kellett-Bowman in one sentence .
what is more important at the moment for the development of urban areas - broadband Internet , further modernisation and development of the transport infrastructure , or measures connected with increasing jobs in rural areas , especially during the crisis ?
I also think it essential that we reinstate the budget line for natural disasters .
you waited for the legal services of Parliament and the Council to come out with it , but you knew it !
this is probably the last time I will address this Parliament as chairman of the Committee on Budgets .
an essential point made in the report is that existing large combustion plants too must ultimately comply with the emission limits , since these plants as a whole are responsible for much of the pollutant emissions .
we all hope that this will be possible and I believe that , with the help of the Italian Presidency in these six months , we will be able to succeed .
in this conflict , we should not only spend time pointing the finger , we should first and foremost supply adequate aid to the refugees .
we meet in Strasbourg on a Wednesday every other month .
ladies and gentlemen , the euro has to create stability for Member States .
nevertheless , the opening up to liberalization is progressive and not as strong as the Commission initially proposed .
we would like to have confidence , but it is in very short supply .
do you intend to find a way to prevent a magazine , distributed free of charge in pharmacies in Germany and subtly funded by the pharmaceutical industry , from being affected by this directive ?
more importantly , the Association Agreement provides for constructive political dialogue on human rights and related issues .
important progress has also been made in this area , and you have highlighted this .
people in the United Kingdom are particularly interested in fuel economy because of the punitive fuel tax levels set by our Labour Government , which particularly pose problems for people living in rural areas like my own where public transport is often non-existent .
the Commission &apos;s recommendations remain instrumental in defining the most appropriate answer to petitioners &apos; problems .
I am absolutely convinced , Madam President , that it will not turn out to be a positive signal from Helsinki but that it will , on the contrary , become one big source of frustration .
but if that happens , these databanks must under no circumstances contain information of a personal nature , for example details of racial , religious and political affiliation and sexual disposition .
you will also be aware that consular cooperation within the European Union is a recent development .
( HU ) Thank you for the floor , Mr President .
Madam President , at this late hour , anyone can make a mistake .
I am familiar with the problems from Southern Jutland , where it is worth noting how few people live on one side of the Danish-German border and work on the other side .
the situation in terms of cooperation in the fight against terrorism will also be examined .
tell me !
because in the field of energy , of oil , we are not talking about solely national decisions , I am afraid , but European Union decisions , because the market involves the whole of the European Union and , therefore , the proposal is not that the Commission should decide what should be done or not .
I wonder whether as President I am authorized to do that .
but it is the third principle which I believe poses the greatest challenge in its modern application .
only Poland fares worse than the Czech Republic .
I ask you to write on behalf of the European Parliament a letter that will get Touria Tiouli set at liberty and make it clear that we want nothing to do with states that treat human dignity with such contempt .
a common foreign policy on energy can only make sense in this wider context , a triangle , with supply and security at the top , climate change and alternative sources at its base .
we have to have employability .
the Commission and the advisory committee must carefully monitor and report on developments to the national regulatory bodies and to the players in the market .
much the same is true about housing , although the solution to the problem might not necessitate a change in the Commission ’ s proposal .
the strength of the European Union as the largest trading power in the world resides in its joint position , which is represented by all elements .
these countries are part of Europe , they are already members of the Council of Europe , they feel European and in their heart of hearts - they do not dare to ask openly because the Commission and the Council have made it understood that it would not be very appropriate - their ruling classes want to belong to the European Union .
what is actually happening in practice ?
I hope that the new RAPEX China system will help remedy this .
however , it is clear , both for reasons of mobility - several members referred to numerous new problems with worker mobility in the European Union - and because there are common causes for the problem of viability , that there is a need for cooperation .
why is she being persecuted ?
it is for Member States to decide on the details of prison policy .
this letter accordingly gave a clear political undertaking on the part of the Republic of Cyprus to issue certificates of origin at the request of Turkish Cypriot exporters .
we have agreed on the definition of a refugee , on what is to be understood by subsidiary protection and on the directive on reception conditions , and by all accounts all this will be confirmed at a Council meeting tomorrow .
documents received : see Minutes
unfortunately , I cannot escape this here , either .
this is why I think it is a very good thing that a task force is being set up with Mr Kallas as its chair .
the third signal should , in our view , involve the interminable and dramatic conflict in the Middle East .
since the European Parliament raised this issue about two years ago , the Commission has conducted extensive preparatory work in order to get a full picture of the situation and share it with the general public .
this time the result was 67 % in favour and 33 % against .
secondly , we think that the system of graduation must meet its objective that the only countries or sectors to be excluded should be those that are already operating sufficiently competitively within the market and thus no longer need the GSP .
in accordance with the fundamental principle of this regulation , there must be no commercial aspect to this specific activity .
Mr President , the paper ‘ Citizens ’ agenda : delivering results for Europe ’ is to be welcomed in the emphasis placed on policy delivery rather than on institutional grand designs .
he is from the Moselle valley and is used to flooding ; whenever the waters are at their height , Ralf is at his best , so warm thanks to him .
in future negotiations with the Council , the Committee on Budgets is proposing to introduce an institutional mechanism providing for greater parliamentary involvement before the Council makes decisions on foreign policy spending commitments .
she has established excellent cooperation both with the political groups and , in particular , with the sectoral committees .
the European social model , with its well-known diversity , requires us to reflect together on the sustainability of pension and retirement systems , and also to identify the reforms that are necessary in the labour markets and systems of protection against social risks .
we have before us an objective report which I hope will receive broad support during tomorrow &apos;s vote .
throughout the accession procedure , both Bulgaria and Romania have achieved a great many things .
we are elected by the citizens to do a job and we are entitled to be held to account by them .
this has now been universally recognised .
Mr President , when , on 9 November 1989 , freedom-loving people climbed over the Iron Curtain , history was changed dramatically .
in my opinion , whatever the thresholds , we must not allow there to be differing legislation within the Union .
Austria is clearly protecting the economic interests of national providers and obstructing foreign tourism operators in the single European market .
this is therefore certainly an issue in areas where it is sensible and appropriate to establish minimum standards .
it was stressed that the Union would defend the interests of every Member State in terms of its relations with Russia .
secondly , I would like to draw your attention to the Bahá &apos;i religious community in Iran .
you , like Ulysses returning to Ithaca , must not listen to the songs of the sirens , because they want to lure the ship on to the rocks and for the ship of Europe to sink .
in writing . - ( IT ) I would have liked to have voted in favour of the report into the fight against violence against women because its aim was to establish comprehensive measures to protect women who have been the victims of violence .
- Before the vote on paragraph 5 :
we also recognised one challenge as central at the beginning of the mandate : the need to make a real effort to coordinate and restore consistency between our European budget and the budgets of individual Member States , because the consistency and coordination of the economic policies of the Union and its States are fundamental values for the future of the Union .
Mr President , Mrs Gradin , first let me thank you wholeheartedly for the support you have given to Europol .
we therefore send out a very clear appeal to the Philippines : a ) to uphold the moratorium , b ) to review the thousand or so trials , many of which are of dubious legality with miscarriages of justice and political caprice , and c ) to abolish the death penalty in general , for it can play no part in enforcing the rule of law .
Mr President , I hope that it was not symbolic when the representative of the Council , the Greek minister , left the Chamber when we began discussing the Northern Dimension .
the second is the explicit statement of the need for controls to be carried out without prior warning .
all that remains will be to dream up a system of compensation between production operations to make quite sure that farmers are divided on the subject .
Congo needs peace and stability , but that will not be achieved unless the perpetrators of the most obscene breaches of human rights , who have been enjoying scandalous impunity , are unequivocally identified and punished as an example to others .
the deficit is still extremely large .
 
it is now essential that a legally binding deadline for migration to the use of SEPA instruments be established , as my colleague , Mr Karas , has just said .
this annual report does not provide an adequate point of reference or explanation as to the type of policy to be managed .
the Council said that we boast a long tradition in Europe on human rights , but it must be recognised that sometimes we hesitate in condemning the human rights abuses carried out by our so-called friendly states .
we , the European Parliament , have taken an initiative and have been waiting for a regulation of this kind for years .
as a consequence of that , the manufacturers of tyres , bicycles , clothing , medical equipment , dairy products , frozen foods , specialist papers , domestic appliances , hand tools , computer components and oil and gas components will all suffer , every single one of them .
we hope we can get support for them because they would improve the overall end result .
after all , as Galbraith said : &apos; Money is not superior to democracy &apos; .
the UK Government has vowed to end this obscenity - but to date they have fallen short .
Mr President , I support moves to continue to develop international trade .
until we have the results of these investigations , it would be premature to take a position .
there are so many destabilising forces !
in a democracy , after all , the citizen is sovereign , not the MP , and the most important form of expression is a referendum , not votes that compromise MPs and parliaments .
thirdly , opposition to the regime .
I therefore think that it is a matter for regret that although there is a verbatim report of proceedings for yesterday afternoon , there is no verbatim report of the historic proceedings yesterday morning , and I simply wanted to ask if that would be rectified .
why is there nothing in the document that analyses the reasons for failure at Copenhagen and suggests lessons ?
there are risks in what we are doing within the European Union - in some cases , perhaps - with regard to existing laws which are considered to be excessive .
the report contains some good proposals for reducing these and other unnecessary costs .
in March of this year , we adopted a communication on gender equality in development cooperation , stating that gender-based violence in all its manifestations violates women &apos;s human rights and is indeed a serious obstacle to the achievement of equality , development and peace .
finally , the execution of the programme will also depend on the proper functioning of DG XXIII .
in the new Egypt , all citizens , irrespective of their religion , must be equal before the law , with equal rights for all .
there is a great deal still to do in this regard .
where are the police that the UN could send to help restore law and order ?
the day of this appalling event has become a European day of commemoration for the victims of terrorism .
I am nevertheless prepared - and I believe I can also speak for Commissioner Fischer Boel here - to explore any possibilities existing within the present framework .
ladies and gentlemen , first and foremost , it is not my personal responsibility to make proposals on this .
there is no doubt that whilst the Commission has tightened up on personal imports , which I welcome , we are still wide open to the disease entering the EU .
we should look at the situation fairly and consider the underlying causes .
I am a diabetic and were it not for biotechnology from the liver of a poor innocent pig I would be a dead man today .
that was a long time ago , in fact it was 18 months ago Mr Flynn first promised us this .
prevention also requires cooperation between institutions and the Member States , dialogue with citizens and information and education of the public .
on the other hand , we can go a long way using the existing tools .
 
curiously , that list contains , amongst others , the directives on the protection of the Community ’ s interests and combating people trafficking .
in the future assessment of the Phare programme we should also find out how funds have been used to improve the position of children .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is a great honour and also a little impertinent to speak before the Chairperson of my delegation , Mrs Schleicher , whom I would have preferred to follow .
thirdly – and this is crucial to us and also to me as rapporteur – it must be made clear beyond any doubt that when negotiations are opened , the emphasis in the first stage of those negotiations will be on further fulfilling the political criteria in law , but also in practice .
when I address Members and officials of the European Union institutions and bodies in person , as I did eight times in 2003 , I am keen to underline the value of reacting promptly and constructively to complaints .
transparency cannot work in one direction only .
this is not just a formality : since this Parliament &apos;s opinion is mandatory , we could have used such an obligation to have a positive influence on decisions during the opening of this intergovernmental conference .
President , as a former British European Commissioner once said : &apos; I hesitate to intervene &apos; .
Watts report ( A4-0310 / 98 )
in this case , Commissioner , your work is made all the easier and we share the same aim : to maintain the largest fish stocks possible in the sea , because , without fish , there will be no fishermen and , without fishermen , there will be no fish for consumers .
to achieve this we naturally need investment in research , but also in training and education , and tangible levels of investment to ensure a better environment in the future .
opium from Afghanistan , which ( according to the specialists ) is considered to be the best , funds all activities in Afghanistan , Pakistan and elsewhere .
the Member States have committed themselves to implement these guidelines in their own national programmes .
even the understanding of the outcome which needs to be achieved by means of a certain law can be totally different from country to country .
the Belgian Presidency is convinced of this and I really hope this question will be on the agenda of the Laeken Summit .
the project to which I refer is the Committee on Missing Persons ; it exists under the aegis of the United Nations , and the humanitarian work it does is crucial in terms of the help it gives to both communities as they look for some 2 000 persons who are still listed as missing .
all reporting of opposition parties is negative , with the MDC a particular target .
these proposals do not even include what you yourself have defended during your term as Commission President .
I wish you well and congratulate you on your presidency , but I also ask you specifically to press these points with the United States of America .
we know the means used to turn Moldova eastwards and to create problems with Romania .
freedom from discrimination is a fundamental right for everyone living in the European Union .
our citizens , who are indeed the owners of their currency , are being excluded from this decision to expropriate them ; they are in fact doubly excluded , both now and in perpetuity .
Mr President , I have just returned from a private visit to Zimbabwe .
we must look at the new ideas proposed by the different experts to the UN Panel .
Europe is facing considerable challenges .
the relationship between the ASEAN countries and the EU , which has changed a great deal since 1980 , certainly requires a new dynamism .
the European Union asked Turkey to implement appropriate measures as laid out in the European Union report of November 2000 .
it worries me that these three Baltic States are in fact not connected with the European Union via a normal , modern highway .
there is no certainty that it will subsequently be given priority .
one in three companies gave the introduction of the women &apos;s quota as the reason it withdrew from the stock market .
there are no doubts about the actual individual , who is to be commended ; but her appointment is really quite unwise .
this is an old issue that rears its head at frequent intervals , but many dramas bring us back to it .
Madam President , I would like to apologize to you , the Commissioner and the rapporteur , because I was attending the public hearing of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy with members of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank .
he is also disrupting the relations which have been expanding in the last decade between countries on that continent and the European Union .
it is necessary , though , to take this argument to its logical conclusion by also stating what has brought about this culture of opaqueness bordering on arrogance : it is a consequence of the privileged position accorded to the Commission among the institutions , and of the sense of superiority which follows from it , and it is this sense of superiority that it is desired to bolster by means of the European Constitution .
I believe that keeping up this dialogue - and , in fact , these negotiations - for Turkey &apos;s accession is indeed the right way to make progress in the matter of respect of fundamental rights and , generally speaking , the rule of law and democratic reforms in Turkey .
the agency would need considerably stronger powers in order to become an effective instrument in monitoring and ensuring the rights of citizens .
Kyrgyzstan ( debate )
it should be a constant concern of our co-operation , and of its necessary renewal , to prevent encouraging this brain drain .
they may find themselves beaten , deprived of any medical treatment , deprived of water in high temperatures , and sometimes , as was the case in Morecombe Bay in the UK , they are left to die .
the job of legislating should accordingly shift more explicitly from the executive to the lawmaking authority .
I should like to conclude by saying that this is , of course , an exercise that will give rise to debate .
first of all , in the future , the main priority of the cohesion policy must be aid to regions that are lagging behind in their development , in other words , the poorest regions .
this only goes to show the sorry state of support for the art of writing .
however , as you know , Mr Collins , we have set an agenda and everyone has agreed to it .
we must also , however , bear in mind the fact that the minimum procedural guarantees are one point on which we have to add value to the Human Rights Convention , more specifically to its Article 6 , for that Article 6 is our common foundation in Europe , and something to which we all feel committed .
it is true that there are opposing economic arguments : the hundreds of Spanish fishermen , who are , moreover , Carmen Fraga &apos;s voters , and the Italians .
it is surprising , and I too found it astonishing , that there is one sector of industry in which there have indeed been very few common standards to date , namely aircraft construction .
I am a committed supporter of monitoring infringements of rights outside the European Union , but at the same time , I think it is important that practices disadvantageous to national minorities within the territory of the EU are not passed over in silence .
I am deeply convinced that Parliament &apos; s special role must continue .
from my own point of view as a British Conservative Member who joined this Parliament three years ago and who has been consistently engaged in internal market activities since then , it is the first time we have had a statement of this kind .
I am unaware of the latest developments as regards school fruit , but we thought the Commissioner &apos;s idea in this respect was endearing .
the third criticism is that it was the Commission itself that did not adopt adequate measures to deal with the mad cow disease crisis .
since the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats and the Union for Europe of the Nations Group are relinquishing their participation in the vote on the great report , I would suggest that you have a block vote , which will save time .
nothing would remain of the high ambitions entertained .
this is how railway companies are given the freedom to curtail the sale of tickets for , and information relating to , far-away destinations , and , to an increasing degree , to restrict passenger-friendly offers for travelling abroad .
Mr President , the right of employees to be consulted and informed has been enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights , but what use are frameworks set up at national or EU level , when employees are too often presented with faits accomplis , learning of restructuring processes only after the event or from the media ?
positive action to develop Moldova must be supported with measures that boost the democratic system .
and to consider that it can be resolved by making proclamations seems to me to be an absolute non-starter .
telling ourselves &apos; Let us build upon the work we have done because we just need to make some changes &apos; is not enough .
concerning the second question on the reform of the judiciary and the fight against corruption and organised crime , both countries have shown determination to undertake necessary reforms in this field .
this study is facilitated by the fact that postal services have already been liberalised in several EU Member States , such as the UK , Sweden , and the Netherlands .
in November 1999 the Commission approved at first reading a code of good administrative behaviour to be incorporated into its Rules of Procedure .
in the aftermath of the war in Gaza , there were a number of attacks on Jewish property and Jewish interests , including in my home town .
in addition to the Commission &apos; s proposals , we must therefore be well aware that we are up against a major problem .
I would draw particular attention to my own one , which envisages compensation for Strasbourg , because we are not going to get Parliament &apos;s sittings to Brussels without compensating Strasbourg .
should you be prepared to use violence if a diplomatic avenue does not lead to the concessions demanded of Saddam Hussein ?
the imbalance , symmetry and situation of Palestinians and Israelis , of occupied and occupiers , are not trivial considerations .
everyone had the time and the opportunity to express their opinions and comments .
I shall restrict myself to addressing the essential aspects , keeping it brief and to the point .
we certainly have a heart for children , but nothing concerns us quite so much as whether the juvenile fish are thriving .
firstly , there is the country of origin principle .
welcome
Cyprus is still suffering the invasion and occupation of the Turkish troops and yet , we are still turning a blind eye to it .
this means , amongst other things , improving labelling - an effective means of guaranteeing that consumers are informed .
as Mrs Pack has just said , one key aspect is town-twinning activities , which foster mutual acquaintance and understanding by means of common selective , but also structured , multiannual agreements .
the problem is two-fold .
the second condition is that the associated bureaucracy should not be allowed to become an end in itself , as with so many similar initiatives and EU institutions .
. the issue of immigration is one that , as politicians and as members of the general public , we should treat with the utmost importance and place high on our list of priorities .
you also said that in 1998 and 1999 , the working party chose neither to authorise nor propose the withdrawal of this product .
the citizens of third countries have to be thoroughly informed about the immigration rules and about the control methods ; the criteria for refusing access have to be objective and verifiable , with a view to preventing the unpleasant , and , alas , frequent episodes of discrimination , which to date still occur .
anyone who cannot see this has been blinded and deafened by political correctness .
from 2006 onwards these assurances will increase the total aid volume by around 25 % annually .
everything that I presented to you , including some experiences from Egypt and Tunisia , will be discussed at the Council next week .
it is a huge compliment to the EU that its achievement in evolving from a Common Market of six countries to a Union of 15 democratic states is such that the states of Central and Eastern Europe , having acquired the freedom to choose , have chosen to apply for membership .
well , it is not sufficient to condemn that State for its unacceptable attitude and ask it to take on its responsibilities in order to ensure that that situation does not arise again .
I think that Latin America is now facing the same challenges as the European Union did during the first years of implementing the common methodology .
the Commission &apos;s actions are evidently worse for the EU with propaganda than without it in terms of legitimacy .
Europol must be able to take active steps to hunt down the criminal networks through the use of specialized information and experience on organized crime , and specifically organized crime as it affects children .
that is why I welcome the fact that President Neyts will support the European Parliament and parliaments throughout the world in their efforts to bring more transparency and also in the end , I hope , more wealth into this world .
they must set in motion an international inquiry that will at last give the people of Belarus hope when the international community no longer keeps silent in the face of the massive violations of human rights in Belarus .
this will represent the first important contribution to environmental protection , too - a contribution that will at the same time present new job opportunities .
the EU has repeatedly stated that it stands ready to support such a process .
but this can only be done - and I stress &quot; can only be done &quot; - where we have harmonisation of safety standards .
we all know that the new rules adopted by Parliament on the situation of parliamentary assistants are nothing more than internal regulations .
this huge market has also given rise to new forms of computer piracy and crime specialising in fraud and counterfeiting , or so-called cybercrime . Something therefore needs to be done to protect the interests of those issuing , using , being paid by or acquiring these new means of payment .
we thank the honourable Member and his colleagues for the dedicated way in which they completed this exceptionally difficult task .
as you also know , the Member States did not adopt our proposals .
the difficulty is that a lot of the processing capacity in Ireland is not exactly on the shore or on the docks , but further inland .
the Commission accepts all the six amendments which are before the House today .
we must take steps to help them in this respect , and indeed we should help all these countries in a more committed and coherent fashion .
a swift decision must and could be reached by taking account of those countries where cofinancing is already envisaged and where the projects have got off to a good start on a technical level .
given this scenario , if nothing is done , the rise in unemployment will definitely be followed by more poverty , more social exclusion , more insecurity , more crime and , in particular , more distrust .
in paragraphs 12 and 16 of our report , we call for the creation of a specific cross-cutting administrative unit within the Directorate-General for Regional Policy to deal with islands .
correct !
I believe that would be a very powerful signal for the European Council to send to all Europeans , the signal that Europe goes on .
all the budget lines now have a legal base , and the appropriations can also be disbursed .
this shows the importance that Europe attaches to eliminating poverty , hunger , disease and infant and maternal mortality between now and 2015 .
these are very important issues and we have managed to have them debated during this January part-session , which was difficult since there were institutional aspects to be resolved .
I would be grateful for a correction from Mr Howitt , as otherwise legitimate debate on accelerated EU membership for Turkey will be stifled .
there is a genuine lack of decision when the role of transport in the regional development of the peripheral and , a fortiori , the outermost regions is raised , even though the Treaties recognise in this case the need for treatment that can derogate from common transport market rules .
I will not go into the detail .
Mr Lamy , I must ask you to interrupt your speech .
secondly , the Commission suggested that the scheme be launched on a pilot project basis .
all of this serves to dissuade people from investing in the economy , thereby leaving it to the mercy of the large , stateless , financial groups .
as I told the House earlier in the month , an additional ECU 200 m has been earmarked for support measures in connection with BSE .
however , that is a matter for the Irish Presidency .
one wonders whose political will are we talking about ?
in this connection , I can only acknowledge and express my support for what Mr Gemelli has just said .
such daily risk-taking is represented by our 74 colleagues killed in Iraq - a figure twice that recorded in 20 years of war in Vietnam - and the five Iraqi journalists being held today among the 120 journalists detained in Iraq by the US army , with no information at all available on why they are being held , what they are accused of or how exactly they can be defended .
for others , at the heart of the project lies enhancing and increasing economic cooperation around the euro , and , more then any other characteristic , this would make Europe &apos; s relationship with globalisation clear and would indicate our ability to be a genuinely global force , at least at European level .
successful enlargement also requires , however , the modernization of the Union &apos;s own policies .
as a Northerner , I say that we can do better ourselves , at least while we have not yet squandered the whole of our heritage in terms of legal culture .
the debate is closed .
recent events , like mad cow disease or the disastrous situation of the nuclear submarine bases at Murmansk , clearly illustrate the need for strong restraining action at European level .
in writing . - ( PT ) As was clear from the debate , and as expressly stated in its programme , the Slovenian Presidency will continue to follow closely the agenda of the German Presidency , giving priority to the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon .
this path is not a smooth one , but the prospect of future membership of the European Union multiplies the sorely needed pro-reform energy .
unfortunately , the list of social problems in Lithuanian urban areas is somewhat longer .
.
I represent the most peripheral region in Europe - the west of Ireland and the border counties - one which for decades has lived in the shadow of the conflict of Northern Ireland , has suffered unemployment and emigration among the worst in Europe .
in it contacts with third countries , the Presidency will raise all the issues it considers important and appropriate to deal with .
as rapporteur , I was very disappointed that we lost these legal framework amendments .
perhaps , Mr Commissioner , you could describe again how the Commission , as part of its responsibility for controlling marine nations , will ensure here too in six or twelve months &apos; time that the obligatory inspection of ships by the flag nations is actually carried out , so as to ensure safety standards are met in each case .
for all the above reasons , I also disagree with the view that the EU cannot meet its Kyoto commitments .
they ensure for our partners from ACP countries the immediate and asymmetric opening up of markets with long transitional periods , exemptions and regular monitoring , and they also set out commitments to political reforms .
I do not have time to mention each of the points , but there were a number of interesting points made during the course of the debate .
the Commission has expressed its strong support for this radically new approach initiated by the World Bank and the IMF .
I agree with the view of the European Parliament that we now have to plan and distribute EU money earmarked for the structural funds so that in the new long-term financial period , enough money is allocated to ensure the harmonious development of all EU regions .
( FI ) Mr President , the former Ukrainian Prime Minister , Yulia Tymoshenko , has had to answer several corruption charges this spring , and a ban on travel in February prevented her from coming to meet us in Brussels .
lastly , we should call on the services of the EIB and this , with the launch of a European loan , could form useful contributions to promoting investment that generates employment .
( B5-0212 / 2002 ) by Mr Sacrédeus , Mr Suominen and Mr Posselt , on behalf of the PPE-DE Group , on the disappearance of a Member of the Moldovan Parliament ;
you will have even more responsibility for it .
in writing . - ( PT ) Taking into account the Court of Auditors &apos; report on the annual accounts of the Euratom ( European Atomic Energy Community ) Supply Agency ( ESA ) for the financial year 2009 , together with the ESA &apos;s replies , I voted for this decision , which grants the Executive Director of the ESA discharge in respect of the implementation of the ESA budget for the financial year 2009 .
I do , however , wish to express my heartfelt thanks for the interest you have shown in this debate .
their absence suggests a degree of ambiguity , and that worries me .
in addition to providing the Commission with a database containing important information on relevant insolvencies in the EU air industry as of 1 January 2000 , the consultant has been asked to consider the issue of passengers stranded due to bankruptcy .
secondly , if NATO is going to carry out military operations , the international High Representative should clearly be European , as is the case in Bosnia where excellent results have been achieved .
however , we are also producing a cultural landscape that can be seen , that provides recreational spaces for you all , for all of us , for our society , that provides jobs not just in agriculture but also in tourism and in many other areas .
although every effort is being made to complete the work as soon as possible , the procedure involved is , of necessity , somewhat lengthy .
when a State refuses , illegitimately , to grant citizenship to people who have lived in their territory for many years , it is denying them access to European citizenship .
in fact , in its eagerness to promote business , this proposal has not provided the proper safeguards for user safety or healthcare quality , particularly as regards non-hospital healthcare .
by comparison , the risks posed by traditional herbal remedies are minimal .
the annual report should definitely be circulated as widely as possible , since it includes a clear description of the area of authority of the European Ombudsman and thus forms an important source of information for all citizens .
one thing is true of both Ireland and Northern Ireland , which is that we recognize completely the difficult market situation which has occurred on the island of Ireland .
yet the Commission tells us that SMEs , as I said , must be targeted and actively encouraged to get involved .
we agreed that the underlying principle of any legislation on food is to protect human health and it is this very reason that makes it crucial to apply the precautionary principle to risk management , when scientific data are insufficient or inconclusive .
I have to say I have not heard so much hypocrisy for such a long time !
our goal is to decide on the admissibility of a complaint within one month and to close a case in which an inquiry has been launched within one year .
how do we go about this ?
cooperation of this kind would make it possible to avoid contradictory macrobudgetary scenarios and to increase the credibility of forecasts using for planning .
European resources need to be used efficiently .
this debate is not a debate , inasmuch as Mrs Gradin has , with great good will , just read us a letter stating the information she was given .
these mark serious progress in terms of the institutional protection of minorities &apos; rights .
the first item is the report by Mr Cutaş , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the 2009 annual report of the European Investment Bank ( 2010 / 2248 / INI ) .
many people are now taking the easy way out - by giving in to pessimism .
they are essential and have to be taken .
the citizens &apos; initiative was a powerful and convincing argument against the &apos; no &apos; side in the Treaty of Lisbon referendum in Ireland , especially when they argued that it was a grab for power by the European Union rather than a truly democratic attempt to involve the citizens .
in my own part of Europe , the Baltic is the most important sea and the one that has been , and still is , exposed to the greatest threats .
the aim is to create a harmonised and appropriate legal framework to facilitate the use of electronic signatures within the Community .
as earlier speakers have said , winemaking culture and wine production are an integral part of the cultural heritage of a number of European regions and have been part of their history stretching back centuries .
I believe he deserves much greater respect in this House than shown by the benches from which this unacceptable description , which I have to rebut , originated .
secondly , we have to continue our efforts to make the Community rules and legislation clear and transparent .
if the Council - and I am addressing this comment to you , Madam President-in-Office - on top of all that decides to appoint a former prime minister , or as now seems likely , a former president , as president of the convention , rather than a former President of the Commission , then I fear that the convention will from the outset be stigmatised to some extent by the fact that the majority of its members will not be guided by the Community method , and that the majority will perhaps not be particularly interested in strengthening the Commission and the European Parliament .
we have a farming industry which is in ruins , and we have Member States that are at odds once more because they are scrabbling around with directives and instructions that they cannot properly understand , precisely because of the lack of harmonization that Commissioner Fischler referred to at the outset .
I spoke before briefly about SEM 2000 , where very promising work is being carried out , and I also state that in the Member States they are preparing more and more for the consequences .
that really is what this is all about .
I fear that in the future legal disputes will be unavoidable .
( Explanation of vote cut short pursuant to Rule 137 ( 1 ) of the Rules of Procedure )
BSE has only recently become a notifiable disease , and it is evident that this disease has not been as closely monitored in other Member States in comparison with the United Kingdom .
the European Union can make some contribution , for example by establishing an observatory which may serve as a centre for a network of scientific institutions where excellent work is done in studying the phenomena of racism and xenophobia .
we can therefore vote on it , and I vote in its favour .
the legal base of Article K.3 only provides for cooperation with the Member States in this field .
lastly : Stockholm must first and foremost be a social summit which does not reduce everything to labour market policy , however important that may be , but also maps out courses for the future with regard to social cohesion and solidarity .
we will erect the customs barriers again .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , I should first like to thank Mrs Ghilardotti for her report , which we support in every respect .
outside , we call for Parliament to have the right to initiate legislation , a right which we have only in a very limited form .
Mr President , sport should , of course , be run by the sporting authorities themselves but , to the extent that it is also an economic activity , it unavoidably falls under employment law , competition law , copyright law , media rights and so on .
Mr President , during the debate last year on Mr Tindemans &apos; first report on a common security policy for Europe , I expressed the wish that the enlargement of the European Union to include central and eastern European countries would not go hand in hand with an identical enlargement of NATO . European and American interests are more and more often divergent and it is high time the people of Europe took charge of their own destiny .
Mr President , I would like to join in thanking the rapporteur , Mr Karas , which I think is only fair .
it is always difficult to say where and how things should be done , but action has to be taken somewhere .
furthermore , I would suggest a special project within the impact assessment procedure - so-called &apos; social benchmarking &apos; .
that agriculture makes a quite decisive contribution to the health of the population is undisputed .
it covers trade under the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and related matters which will apply up until the Member States have ratified the Stabilisation and Association Agreement proper .
where is the beef ?
the tachograph needs to be retro-fitted ; we have the technical facilities to do this .
I think that , if we can agree on this basic position , we can also agree on the type of work which could be delegated to the national offices .
if they do in fact become crime victims , they should at least not have to suffer twice and end up in a worse situation than citizens of the country concerned who are themselves crime victims .
- ( NL ) For a year and a half we have known that President Bush of the United States wanted war .
today , following discussion in the committee , the issue is having its first reading in the European Parliament .
thank you very much , Mr Bangemann .
too many villages have been burnt down in the Balkans in the past decade .
the restructuring of the olive oil sector was less comprehensive than in other sectors and new discussions and conditions therefore appear to be needed .
unfortunately , it is this question that we are forced to ask the Council .
it is , meanwhile , very obvious that we will need to work closely with Parliament , as an institution , on central matters of common interest , notably pay and pensions and the revision of the staff regulations .
it is an excellent report which , in my opinion , requires no further amendments .
I can offer you every guarantee – and I address this in particular to those people who have expressed concerns , which are legitimate concerns – that the Commission intends to apply these Stability and Growth Pact rules objectively and in a uniform manner amongst all the Member States .
what is being proposed is to try to make some headway towards resolving those factors .
it is therefore not enough to defend the principle of equality .
I do not think this has been the most distinguished evening in the history of Parliament .
I also want to mention the focus on maintaining the diversity of agriculture within the Union so as to give a further chance to traditional agriculture as well .
I should also mention a further two extremely serious problems : the corruption affecting many of these countries , with a few exceptions , and the shameful issue of the trafficking of human beings .
in the conclusions of the Council relating to the Convention , one paragraph is devoted to the forum and it seems to be more about informing the network of organisations than having their contributions in the work of the Convention .
it is also a question of farmers embracing the principle of sustainability , which includes animal protection and keeping livestock in an appropriate way .
thirdly , promoting cooperation between cultural operators .
Mr President , as a legal practitioner who has dealt with cross-border claims , it is not all rosy in the garden as might be suggested in the report .
climate change will also affect households , companies and certain sections of society , especially the elderly , people with disabilities and low income families .
as regards the Nassauer report , I only want to say that it seems to me to be an excellent report and I agree with its contents .
all agreed that there remains much to be done to translate good intentions and positive words into action .
these are the reasons for the delay .
once again , we are going to consider any request as part of a comprehensive analysis of the project .
.
the Commission will report annually on progress made towards integrating the Roma population in the Member States .
I am quite willing to give you a written answer .
these shortcomings could be remedied if the relevant amendments are accepted at the vote .
I can speak quite freely on this subject , because the Democratic and Social Centre ( CDS ) is the only party that has had a woman as parliamentary leader , minister of justice or secretary-general .
on the one hand , in fact , we condemn the fact that the Commission did not inform Parliament of the initiatives undertaken with regard to origin marking .
thank you , Commissioner .
here the Commission has a vital role to play .
I therefore believe that we will have to hold a debate after all , about a strong , European supervisor , and we will also need to find out how we will distribute this task , and whether this will indeed be done at sector level .
the future of research and of Europe also depends on our ability to make science more attractive to young people .
this is a highly important instrument because it makes our external cooperation stronger , more &apos; policy driven &apos; , and better targets our funding in support of key sectors .
Mr President , even if Doctor Hachem Aghajari does not receive the death penalty , Iran nonetheless remains condemned to domination by its ultra-conservative religious leaders .
progress towards a common market in the area of security and defence has been achieved .
( for results and other details of the votes : see Minutes )
lastly , there is the desire expressed both in the Commission document and Mr Decourrière &apos; s report of using INTERREG for peace and reconstruction in the Balkans : I do not think that the Structural Funds should be used to repair the damage which the Americans inflicted on Serbia during bombardments which were as criminal as they were ineffectual .
this strategy continues to apply , both to the old and to the new Member States , as Mrs Kratsa said and , of course , it must be understood in the best possible way , as Mr Moraes pointed out .
we will get back to the subject when Parliament draws up a report in two years &apos; time .
on the one hand , I am pleased that in the Seventh Framework Programme half a billion euro has been set aside for basic research , and indeed the European Community will recover that half billion on the part of the Member States and businesses .
this is very much the case with the debate on the authorisation of food additives such as thrombin .
the German Minister for European Affairs , Mr Gloser , may talk about sustainability and energy policy - although I have to say that how he keeps a straight face when he talks about the already failed Lisbon Agenda is quite beyond me .
as regards traffic accidents , I share Parliament &apos;s concern to improve the situation of traffic accident victims .
the permission for a merger between Sony and BMG granted by the Commission totally contradicts the European policy to support SMEs in the music industry , which create more jobs than the large companies and represent 99 % of the market players and 80 % of innovation in this sector .
on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , International Women &apos;s Day gives us a united opportunity to focus on issues and challenges women face today - to focus on the various forms of inequality that many women experience , but also to celebrate achievements by women throughout the century .
Mr President , on my return to Parliament I have noted that it is particularly difficult to move through the corridors , especially when voting is about to take place .
they all accepted in the hearings that they will be responsible for themselves and their cabinets .
we await the next progress report from the Commission .
firstly , concerning funds for the Phare programme , the availability of ECU 150 million which is forecast for the end of the financial year must lead us to question ourselves sincerely as to whether the tool is sufficiently adapted for the intended objective .
I welcome the remarks by all those who have mentioned the commitment and the will to work for that goal in due course , as have Mrs Doyle and others .
sometimes , the facts were somewhat distorted to ensure that other bodies with more powers would actually take action .
from the contributions that we have heard from the right of the House , there seems to be some confusion about what parliamentary immunity actually is .
over the past ten years , the Ukrainian government has spent USD six billion to combat the effects , and this spending is set to continue for the time being .
it really is important for all of the EU Member States to show solidarity in the face of this challenge .
next , to echo what my colleague , Robert Goebbels , said , it is true that the G20 is not the solution we ultimately aspire to for world governance , where everyone has his or her place and where there is room for the arbitration authorities that we need .
colleagues , this is not a point of order : it is an interesting point and it might play on some local TV , but it is not a point of order .
it is not possible to disregard this without deliberately violating article 109j of the Treaty .
as far as Georgia is concerned , the onus will be on that country to demonstrate genuine commitment to achieving political and economic reform , which is the only way of guaranteeing Georgia ’ s long-term stability .
my second question concerns the common security policy , particularly with regard to defence .
the Commission intends to present a new framework for SME policy in the second half of this year .
the first step is to establish the correct methods , and it is good that it is being taken .
this creates unemployment in the Union and reduces our wealth and our capacity to achieve the Lisbon objectives .
permit me to make one final observation on the procedure itself .
( HU ) I remember very well when we set up this Globalisation Fund , and even back then , there was a great deal of debate about how it would not be a good idea if , instead of mitigating the losses , the aid paid from the fund helped workers who had been made redundant to re-integrate into the labour market , thereby encouraging , as it were , companies to conveniently take advantage of the relocation facility so that the fund covers the losing parties &apos; costs .
the Commission cannot apply competition regulations to authorise national aid or joint financing initiatives under the provisions of Regulation 1257 / 99 .
lastly , introducing tests for access to every category does not allow users and much less the authorities to manage and monitor the system , and there is not the slightest guarantee that safety will be improved .
we have spent and are spending quite a lot of money to assist Member States with regard to the vaccines and the vaccination .
regarding the definitions of scope , it would have been better to include not only the deliberate and fraudulent sides of such activities but also the commercial motives behind them .
in writing . - ( SV ) The resolution on rising food prices in the world could have been a valuable contribution to the current debate on the EU &apos;s agricultural policy and its consequences .
. I voted for this amendment NOT to support an increase in the budget , but because I do not wish any monies to be spent by the UK , which should rather be spent in fulfilling bilateral agreements .
can it provide information on the state of play as regards negotiation of the above-mentioned agreement on the return of immigrants ?
the most important advance for the future is , of course , the Transport Ministers &apos; recognition of the new definition of slots as usage rights .
we should also consider the global commitment to fight climate change .
we would also happily adopt an outline for the EU membership prospects of Ukraine during the European Union - Ukraine summit .
– Mr President , during the campaign prior to the election that took place in Spain in the spring of 2004 , Mr Zapatero , who is now the Prime Minister of my country , stated that he would airbrush Spain out of that photo of the three warmongers taken in the Azores .
that has always been the case down the centuries .
Member of the Commission . - ( FR ) Mr President , Belarus is at a crossroads .
the whole economy of many Caribbean states is actually in turmoil as a result of this decision .
looking at it very objectively , however , in the context of finding a balance between competitiveness and combating greenhouse gases , we really must establish a good balance in relation to our major partners .
we need to have a flexible system which is good for all the workers in Europe .
to take just one example , it is very difficult to talk about equality when there are so few child care facilities .
this is necessary for the establishment of fair and equitable economic relationships that are mutually beneficial , are at the service of the development of peoples and countries , and are not solely beneficial for a small number of financial institutions and companies .
today , Mr Viola is presenting us with a proposal for an integrated policy for the island regions . I congratulate him and thank him for his work .
that is why we asked at the time , in the December resolution , that a clause about the revision of the financial perspectives be included , in order to deal with this additional need should it arise .
. ( PT ) I am voting against this report because I believe that the European Cooperative Society ( SCE ) exceeds the scope of legislative harmonisation and constitutes a new supranational legal form .
there have to be security checks - both on the public side and airside .
so the problem is serious , and the phenomenon of poverty has worsened further following recent enlargements of the EU .
now , however , Section 301 of US external trade law is coming back to haunt us .
it belongs to the Camorra , who we must fight .
before the vote :
it should be pointed out , however , that the right to a citizens &apos; initiative may be a democratic instrument , but it also opens the door to a federalised EU .
this is why we fully reject the two amendments tabled by the Liberal and PPE-DE groups and support Amendment No 5 , adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , which further strengthens the guarantees concerning that profession .
there are two other amendments : Nos 33 , tabled by Mr Böge on behalf of the PPE-DE Group , and 37 , tabled by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group .
we are proposing a system which considerably improves legal certainty for SMEs .
although we may need some of the legislation Mr Hughes has proposed in his report and which the Commission has proposed , without a guarantee of a proper comprehensive and independent impact assessment , the ELDR Group will have to abstain on the vote tomorrow .
( ES ) Mr President , President of the European Council , I have two messages : one of concern , and one of demanding encouragement for the work that lies ahead .
then there is the mandatory warning about consulting a doctor . I think I speak for the great majority of the committee in saying that we think a doctor should be consulted when any form of medication is taken , and that we are in favour of keeping this mandatory warning .
as things stand , more than half of the European population has approved the ratification of this Constitutional Treaty and my impression is that this ratification is not irrelevant in terms of European law .
people are dispatched to sea aboard unseaworthy craft in the middle of winter . No one knows how many drown each year in this manner .
the number of flights , which was originally three per day , has been cut down to two .
then there will be further changes , as soon as the enlargement of the European Union has actually taken place .
the campaign against fraud is , of course , a particularly crucial area .
our group would expect the presidency and the Commission to undertake swift and radical actions and measures vis-à-vis our energy partners , Russia and Ukraine , to restore gas supplies .
that is a step in the right direction .
fifteen or twenty years ago , human rights and development aid were key strands of foreign policy .
therefore our experience is different from that of the right and that is why we consider that collective rights are as important as individual ones although we recognize and understand the latter in terms of this report .
conversely – and unfortunately – we have to note that losses from the Structural Funds have increased from EUR 482 million to EUR 694 million .
the rural population , diversity , environmental protection and public health must be maintained .
this also applies to the enlargement of our Community .
thank you for your comments .
but it would be nothing short of catastrophic if the Council allowed the debate on net contributors to overshadow the financing plans for enlargement .
it is an important point but , unlike many of you , I am less concerned with EU location nationalism and more concerned with who can actually use Internet technology .
however , the principles that should be taken into account when establishing the rules to apply can be briefly outlined .
I believe that it is better to cut down consumption , which is also a good guiding principle in life generally .
but we have for the first time reached the stage where Turkey must present us with a binding programme and must tell us what it intends to do to change conditions in Turkey .
as a Member of this House , but also a member of the executive of my party , I would like to say that I have some sympathy for Mr Weber .
what I found particularly refreshing about this debate was the speech by Mr Gollnisch , in which he made a truly impassioned plea for the establishment of the European Constitution , something which we obviously have in common – I was previously unaware of this .
Mugabe should remember his promise to step down and do so now .
I hope you take another good look at this , Commissioner .
.
it would be both significant and fitting if Nelson Mandela were to be permitted to put his name to this important agreement for South Africa while he is still President .
Madam President , as someone who has a parent who was born in India and has many friends from India in the various and diverse communities of faith which make up India &apos;s rich mosaic of cultures , I can assure you that it gives me no pleasure to move this resolution today .
similarly , we can support the amendments specifying that the victim must be informed in a language they understand or that they can submit a request for asylum as well as the amendments stipulating that the decisions to withdraw or not to renew a residence permit can be appealed against and that the withdrawal of authorisation must have good reason .
we also have problems with such behaviour on the part of government agencies , such as the police , in Germany , the UK and Italy , for example .
so there is much in this report to like .
they will repeat what they are always repeating , namely that the European Parliament and especially the Commission are eager only to produce new regulations for regulation &apos;s sake .
I am , essentially , very pleased with the various measures put forward as , although they are rather restrictive for our operators , they are in line with the challenges , and I would emphasise that the most important of these measures are , without doubt , those relating to monitoring , as it is certainly true that no recovery plan can be effective without monitoring .
the mechanism for providing aid should also make use of money earmarked for targeted investment in technological innovations , in accordance with guidelines for improving road safety and environmental protection .
Mr Barón Crespo , Mr Poettering and others raised the issue of the appointment of the new President of the Commission .
we should continue the reform of the common agricultural policy from 2003 by reducing support , and we should seriously discuss further transfers of agricultural support to rural development policy .
( IT ) Madam President , Vice-President Tajani , ladies and gentlemen , the title of this report already contains the keyword , in that it refers to an industrial policy .
that is of vital importance .
finally , this act of ours is a challenge to the Council and the Union &apos;s other institutions : they too must clarify the conditions under which not only political appointees but also officials of all grades perform their duties .
in the meantime , the rapporteur and the committee have carried out detailed work and are now proposing that discharge be granted to the Committee of the Regions for 2001 .
I wish to draw attention to a few other matters . One is the question of the development of the countryside and the other is urban policy .
recently we expressed strong concern over the unrest in Xinjiang , deplored the loss of life , and expressed our condolences and sympathy to the families of the victims .
earlier this afternoon I replied to a question by Mrs Kauppi where she asked why the European Patent Office did not satisfy itself with just one expert and the reason I gave is that we need the highest quality patents and therefore it is sometimes necessary to use more than one expert .
this is equally goods news for small energy companies who are sometimes deterred from further expansion owing to high market entry costs .
some have questioned the validity of this legislation and they are free to do so .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - ( DA ) Mr President , there is an election in Denmark today .
Slovenia was added to the list this year , bringing the number of participating countries to 28 .
the new harmonised rules will ensure transparency , legal certainty and a reinforced internal market .
these are huge things .
one country cannot be allowed to set the agenda and direct policy at world level ; it must be done through the UN itself , so that individual states cannot throw policy off course and steer it in a particular direction .
on the subject of local initiatives , I would also like to mention the organisation of the tariff systems , which have to be adapted to the decentralised structure and cannot simply take priority over a large number of major areas and ideas .
the amount to which Mr Turmes has referred is indicative , as it is a minimum to be invested in these regions .
in order to ensure this , the Commission is clarifying its present substantive rules .
I am also glad to see that there is no longer a reference to the General Product Safety Directive ( GPSD ) .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , can I first say thank you very much for the many kind comments , including those of Chris Davies , although I know even less than he about football so I could not follow the picture , but I guess it was a positive one !
it is important to highlight the fact that the action plan will help us to coordinate Community initiatives and those of the Member States .
I did not hear Commissioner Byrne update us on that point in the statement he just made .
that will take us up to 2070 but , meanwhile , we have set ourselves targets which we have to reach by 2050 !
it is at the level of education and training that the problem of employment for Europeans - the employability of Europeans - into the 21st century will be determined .
is this really all that can be sent from this Chamber and from the EU institutions to the Ukrainians , who are fighting today about the same things which once happened to the Poles and the Czechs ?
my only fear is that this may not be the case , and my scepticism is based on a number of points .
I am in favour of that , but should we not also inform people of the fact that African nations spend more on arms than they receive in development aid ?
it is also expensive . You know just as well as we do that the ridiculous combustion of air fuel in the sky is environmentally unacceptable .
we think it to be only justice not to interfere with a domestic decision on legal recognition of such partnerships .
what is my concern is the question of how we can allow a dangerous product to be legally produced if we believe that it is so dangerous .
I am not forgetting , and we cannot forget , that 80 % of the citizens of Europe today live in towns and that is why this URBAN instrument is extremely important .
I underline &apos; on behalf of Parliament &apos; .
the UK delegation of the Labour Party recognises the serious UK Government concern over this directive .
this budgetary laxity led governments to propose , for 1998 , a budget which , in payment appropriations , surpasses the real expenditure of 1996 by 8 % .
but for once it could be written in the history books that these terrible disasters in both these countries were the beginning of a new relationship , even a new political relationship , and possibly even a new economic relationship .
the ministers who sit in the Council of Ministers defend their national policy first and foremost .
I should have expected the European Parliament to signal far more clearly that consumer protection and public health are not subordinated to economic interests in the European Union .
it has been decided that there should be a contract to cover the services related to the budget headings managed by DG IA , including the needs of the RELEX common services and DG IA itself , and those related to the running of an enhanced programme of micro-projects led by the delegations .
the report by Mrs Mathieu , on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control , on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the Community Fisheries Control Agency for the financial year 2008 ( SEC ( 2009 ) 1089 - C7-0201 / 2009 - ,
we have national champions in certain sectors – not just energy , but also telecommunications – which are often also national champions under public ownership , in which the State finds itself playing the dual role of controller and direct acting manager of companies .
Mr Barroso , what is the real reason for your Commission &apos;s opposition to a financial transaction tax ?
we cannot , therefore , consider less than half the sum that Parliament deemed essential only a month ago to be sufficient .
training is the work of men and is susceptible to change .
I hope this will come about during your term in office , Chancellor .
it is also a federal problem .
my first point is that not just some of us , but all of us are concerned about our citizens &apos; safety .
difficult decisions about abortion , for example , should be taken on an individual basis rather than form part of a broad and general statement that is made from the comfort of our own chairs .
let me focus on two particular issues .
( HU ) Thank you very much , Madam President .
Europe need lament neither over the success of the US economy nor over the strong dollar if it does not learn any lessons for itself from it .
I do not know whether this terrible war of neocolonial aggression against Iraq will soon come to an end . What I do know for certain is that I will not be one of those celebrating the victory of the imperialist United States in the war to which the whole world was opposed but which it has been unable to prevent .
furthermore , much more needs to be done in the area of human intelligence , that is , the old-fashioned spies , rather than focusing exclusively on modern technology , even if that is sexier .
through this report , the European Union is inviting the European Spring Council to give a strong political impetus and draw up a roadmap for all the legal initiatives in order to guarantee , along with Parliament , that they will be adopted in good time .
so let us also give the young people of Europe a chance by increasing the funding for this .
we do so because it has the potential to add value to our transport policy .
behind all of that , a challenge in terms of competition for our economies exists that we cannot overlook , and we are counting on your vigilance in order to prevent this from leading to a situation that results in the European Union being discriminated against .
the EU contribution for 2006 amounted to only EUR 2 billion .
the European Parliament , as we have seen , has reason to be concerned for the fate of this seriously ill man , Patrick Kelly , who as we have heard is a detainee in Northern Ireland .
for its part , the EU will guarantee , in another third country , fishing opportunities that will help keep its long-distance fishing fleet operational .
furthermore , and in view of the high indebtedness and the expected increase as a result of ageing , it is recommended that the Greek authorities as soon as possible draw up future forecasts for spending linked to ageing and improve the long-term sustainability of the public accounts , providing the resources necessary to achieve the mid-term objective .
we cannot continue to go about things in this way .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
perhaps this programme , with its delays and miserly budget , is just an afterthought in the overall endeavour ?
the main reason for this is because it is taken as given that human rights enjoy the same respect throughout Europe .
( LT ) Mr President , President Lukashenko &apos;s policies have pushed him , along with his whole country , into deep self-isolation in relations with the West .
the Council believes that Europol is already under democratic control . I am not aware of any proposals aimed at changing the control system for Europol .
it is no evidence of constitutional statehood , if murder is punished in Europe entirely differently or not at all .
 
the mood before these conferences is always the same , but there are also opportunities .
funds used under the DCI must target poverty alleviation , and although I support the creation of an instrument for cooperation with industrialised countries - ICI + - that instrument should not be financed by the DCI either .
both the Christian Democrats / Conservatives ( PPE-DE ) and the Socialists ( PSE ) would seem to have a hidden agenda of trying to create a two-party system in the European Parliament .
of course , we must financially support fishermen who work in good faith in order to pass this intervention .
I feel an amendment of this type is essential to prevent the sort of administrative unwieldiness which too often acts as a brake on the proper application of new conditions .
what we do not want is for the small amount of money to be spent on even more interminable research projects .
I voted in favour of the European Parliament &apos;s own-initiative report on evaluation and assessment of the Animal Welfare Action Plan ( the Paulsen report ) , because I fully support the objective of strengthening animal welfare in the EU .
we accuse the Swedish Presidency openly .
what about the victims of medical negligence , industrial injury or any other type of claim against insurers ?
rather than making a lengthy factual statement I will draw the attention of Parliament to two documents which the Commission has made available .
but the significance of a single currency will certainly be greater , with an added attraction , apart from payments , of financial applications and the formation of reserves by the issuing banks .
this would make up for what the European Union currently lacks , namely a space where a common diplomatic culture can be patiently nurtured . In the event of crises , Europe would then be able to adopt common positions , based on a common geostrategic assessment .
what a good aim , what fine proposals , what an important Commission report !
I would like to emphasise at this point that we should not forget that the Treaty of Lisbon and the forthcoming enlargement mean that the European Parliament will be faced with new tasks .
this year , we sponsored a new resolution on the ground that we have to have a resolution : we have no dialogue ; we fail to recognise that we have no dialogue because we had a resolution .
despite the hopeful ray of sunlight offered by the G8 a few days earlier in St Petersburg , the minds of certain negotiators clouded over and the negotiations of the development round were suspended .
Mr Waigel recently mentioned one cannot at the same time be &apos; in &apos; and &apos; out &apos; , outside the euro zone and inside the X-Council .
in Belgrade the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is still dominated by President Milosevic whose conduct towards Kosovo has dominated so much of our international discussions over recent months .
which is only natural when our people see Europe as the lackey of the United States , blind , deaf and dumb to the genocide of the Palestinians , and turn their back on established political forces , charmed by the magic flute of past national splendours .
Mr Wiersma also said how disappointed he was that I have not agreed to take a troika to Serbia immediately .
until we have done that , it will simply not be possible to enter into negotiations on an association agreement .
the smart grid will allow solar , wind and hydro-generated electricity to level the security graph .
the current scene and the way it is likely to develop , however , dictate a more prudent approach , aimed at protecting European industry in the face of unbalanced and destructive competition .
if that were to happen , there would be a risk of aggressive states and groupings taking the EU ’ s place and of unemployed Palestinian soldiers and police officers being recruited by Al-Qaeda .
the European Union took its responsibility last week .
in any case , it will certainly not turn out to be a repeat of the Congress of Vienna or the Congress of Versailles , but I could of course be mistaken .
therefore my group supports the amendments for a report each year on cumulative emissions of greenhouse gases and projected cumulative emissions up to 2005 , 2010 and 2020 .
in writing . - ( HU ) The extremist parties gaining seats in many Member States of the Union and temporarily even in the EP cannot become acceptable in European politics .
this progress must of course be assessed in light of the timetable and programmes for measures established at Tampere .
however , the mechanism for optional flat-rate financing , which promises to be successful , will open up further opportunities to our universities and research institutes and will guarantee their broad , longer-term sustainable participation .
we cannot have a repetition of the frustrating situation at Singapore in 1996 , of flagrant non-compliance with what was agreed at the 1994 WTO summit in Marrakesh .
we must defend our communities from the threat of attack while upholding human rights in accordance with international law and the ECHR .
you wrote me a letter which I shall forward to the Rules Committee in order to have a definitive interpretation .
this view has changed only recently , however . In Europe , there is no nation that can stand above the continent ’ s history , providing a viewpoint that would suit everyone without offending anyone .
the situation should be the same in the future .
in essence , there is agreement on the fact that the structures required to tackle this problem are already in place ; I do not believe that we should create new ones .
I also welcome the administration &apos;s efforts to make life more bearable , to gradually reopen schools , and to partially reinstate energy supplies , public transport and medical care in Grozny at least . But that is by no means enough .
and they certainly have , from Prime Ministers and Foreign Secretaries and everyone , to such an extent that we will not be taking that course of action .
it would also be worthwhile monitoring how we deal with the wireless sector .
in that respect , although I am in favour of internal market regulation , I believe that the exceptional nature of the crisis justifies exceptional countermeasures .
secondly , there is a need to eliminate the profound uncertainty about the distinction between services of economic interest and those of non-economic interest .
that was mentioned by Mrs Trüpel and it is a question of ensuring that the cultural aspect is included in other European policies .
there is so much to do , and it has already largely resolved one of the most serious scandals , that of taking on staff outside the Commission without proper provision in the budget .
last night during Question Time we did not come to the question that I intended to pose to the Council .
under the Treaty of Lisbon , Parliament is once again called upon to take part in the negotiations on a new PNR agreement between the EU , the US , Australia and Canada .
for my part , I am wary of suggestions to introduce new forms of taxation .
you said there that after checking all the information , there should be an item on the agenda for the October part-session in Strasbourg on setting dates for a twelfth session in Strasbourg , from 3 to 7 November .
in 1992 the Council outlined in a recommendation on social protection what it saw as the common objectives which would determine the reform of these national systems .
an international arbitrator should have the opportunity at long last to resolve the border issues between Slovenia and Croatia .
I therefore call once again upon Parliament , the Council and the Commission to ensure that this Iranian Jewish minority is not subjected to further oppression at the Court of Appeal , for a certain element is already rejoicing that the Jews have been found guilty .
in future , we also hope to see greater openness as a result of his own-initiative enquiries .
.
therefore , we shall include what Mrs Flautre said , and I shall now record this paragraph as having been orally amended .
it is something we owe European citizens .
the communication entitled &apos; Adapting to change in work and society : a new Community strategy on health and safety at work for 2002-2006 &apos; is a strategy on health and safety for the period in question .
this also emerges from the submitted report , but it has to be read carefully .
I do not agree with this conclusion and , while personal experience is of little worth , I can give endless examples of how products which in other countries or in my own country , when international exhaustion was allowed , could be sold at significantly lower prices , since the Silhouette judgment can only be found on official distribution networks and at considerably higher prices .
I believe that this Presidency has given a fine example of something very important in politics , which is what in sporting terms is known as suppleness .
I am asking why you are not giving me leave to speak .
there is a danger of Parliament impairing the Council ’ s common position on environmental matters , a factor that also emerged from Commissioner Bolkestein ’ s contribution .
Pactio Olisipiensis censenda est !
hygiene and sanitary regulations therefore need to continue to apply during production and agricultural processes .
in the world of business , the higher up the decision-making ladder you go , the fewer women you find in the new information sector , although I believe this is to some extent the case in all sectors .
the country is plagued by corruption .
it should read &quot; inter alia , in the area of environmental protection &apos; .
we have to unequivocally condemn the recent fighting in Mogadishu and the events in Johwar and in other parts of the country , which have claimed the lives of many Somali people .
I urge the Commission to take particular interest and to evaluate the availability of veterinary resources for future disease management within the EU generally .
Madam President , this morning I would like to focus on two main questions .
while we are at it , is South Sudan covered by the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative ( EITI ) , which audits freedom from corruption and examines which oil assets benefit the population ?
the reform of the common agricultural policy in 2003 should see an improvement in the position in relation to agriculture : the introduction of the single farm payment , its close links to cross-compliance measures , will ensure that money is only paid out when it should be .
Mr President , I am going to try to respond quickly to the problems that affect me most directly and leave to Anna Diamantopoulou the problems which fall more within her competence .
the second part of the debate is about the measures actually taken in connection with ‘ Women on Waves ’ .
those who want to return to work after a career break find it increasingly difficult .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we are part of an industrial system , at European level , in which the good reputation of goods greatly depends on the integrity of the production system .
this idea came from the European Neighbourhood Policy – in both formal and substantive terms – given that , in my view , it is close to home that the EU can and should play its main role on the international stage .
– Mr President , when addressing the issue of investment funds in the Union , one must include two vital elements .
this feeling of suspicion is something which also feeds radicalisation and fundamentalism , which can be based on race as well as religion .
food is becoming , to an ever greater degree , a strategic product .
my third point is that it was said that Mr van Baalen was accused of discussing a coup and this is why he was expelled from the country .
the Alliance enables the Member States to exchange information and experiences and in that way to help each other in the search for appropriate political responses .
the immigrant communities are living in fear and anxiety .
in Category 4 , the Council makes the completely unacceptable proposal to implement across-the-board cuts without any justification whatsoever .
but comparing the text we have in front of us today with the one tabled in January , I too must concede that it looks very different - and the changes are certainly for the better from my point of view .
we can well appreciate that .
directives ought essentially to be aimed at establishing goals , not at regulating the details and describing the path to the goal .
Mr President , if you lose , you lose .
all these have resulted in a wide-ranging debate in the Committee on Women ’ s Rights and Gender Equality and a report supported by almost all the groups .
I find it extraordinary that those who have profited so much from European integration in terms of prosperity , security and liberal democracy should now refuse to extend those prizes towards Turkey .
contracts will be terminated wherever this does not entail additional costs .
new standards will be introduced and greater flexibility will open up new markets .
after years of uncertainty , democratic debate in both the old and the new Member countries of the Union will now be on firm ground .
what could be a cause for concern for the future are his autocratic tendencies , which came to the fore when he was the capital &apos; s mayor , and if elected , Madagascar &apos; s power would be in his hands .
I would just like to point out that for many years cross-border companies took advantage of the lack of qualifications and corruption of officials in the post-Communist countries , resorting to tax and accounting fiddles to declare losses and avoid paying tax .
the reform is the fruit of negotiations with the Council , represented by the Czech presidency which , by the way , deserves my full praise , since it has had no shortage of political difficulties to face throughout its term of office ; it is a combination of a structural reform of the directive , which does not affect the foundations of Parliament &apos;s mandate and which fully respects the principle of subsidiarity , since the directive establishes the principle of sanctioning actions in the terms defined by the Court of Justice ruling , while leaving Member States to define the types of penalties .
perhaps we have not always been successful , but we have made considerable efforts to go out and talk to school children , students and the people on the streets in all kinds of formats and formations .
finally , the defence of the EU regime for authorising and marketing GMOs is a point to which I attach particular importance .
I would like to return to a point mentioned .
the one thing that has to be clear is that we cannot apply double standards .
in addition to giving up their seats , young people will be delighted to know that pensioners are being shown respect through the right to travel on public transport for free through our beautiful cities .
unused finance within the framework of DG Climate Action &apos;s multiannual programme could be earmarked for the instrument and then directed towards projects within the sustainable energy field .
I ask you , Commissioner , are we too going to close our eyes , in the name of economic and geopolitical interests , to this serious attack on human rights which is shattering the hopes of so many Iranian men and women , and what will be our attitude as regards the cooperation agreement ?
as to the amendment requesting that the Commission review and assess the ‘ indicative limits ’ , I can only say that the Commission has assessed them in its report .
there is no question that the Commission has demonstrated passivity , incompetence and laxity , even though this is an essential task entrusted to it under the terms of the Treaties .
it can , and should , work even better than it does for the people who are most in need .
( NL ) I make no secret of that , Mr Stoyanov .
it is hoped that the Summit will draw up a schedule for this .
however , it will not be possible for any instructions to be given to the Commission .
so NGOs are pulling their people out of Darfur while indiscriminate attacks continue on civilians .
finally , our thoughts go to everything that has been done , from the foundation of the European Union to date , for Europe to reach this historic stage , the founding fathers and the other architects that have developed &quot; Project Europe &apos; with conviction and tenacity .
it is difficult to make democratic principles credible when the real agenda is MEPs &apos; own money .
we must remember now , especially after the dissolution of the Soviet Union , that they are free , independent States .
because of the weakness in the banking system , we are hesitant about introducing the debt restructuring measures urgently needed in the weaker countries .
SMEs play a key role in the recovery of the European economy and the fight against unemployment , and therefore it would be expedient to make it easier for them to access the capital required for developments .
this is a very important message that has come across here in this debate .
as the author is not present , Question No 45 lapses .
in August , in order to reinforce his power , the President declared a state of emergency , and had supporters of the pro-democracy movement arrested .
it is extremely difficult for me as a gay man not to want to include specifically homophobia .
we need to be abreast of this .
this concept is leading to confusion , because we are constantly having to explain that as well as voice telephony , it also covers data transmission by fax and modem .
finally , we fully support the work of the NGOs and hope that line B7-6000 will be given adequate payment appropriations .
this will self-evidently be at the expense of current net contributors , but it will also be at the expense of current members that are net recipients .
can we tolerate human rights defenders being kidnapped , mistreated and disappearing without any reaction by the courts ?
I should like to emphasise that the broad economic policy guidelines , the aims of our economic policy , do not apply to the euro zone alone but to the entire single European market , the home market of the European Union , and that is how it should stay , because what we do not want to let ourselves be split in two but rather to go on growing closer together .
this procedure is a set-up so that French and German come before Spanish , a language that is not only spoken in Europe , but by 700 million other people in the rest of the world , as Mr López-Istúriz White quite rightly said , which is more than the number of Europeans .
we all know the grave potential if nothing is done and the current growing trend is not stopped .
the Commission &apos;s role of counterbalancing the two legislative bodies is in itself an element of regulatory coherence and consistency , with its constant emphasis on the rationale behind proposed legislation .
I therefore support the updating and optimisation of the current statistics system so that we can have reliable and comparable statistics .
we will not be able to use European industry , which has been dealing with its own affairs well , as a guinea pig again unless the system is operated in a slip-shod fashion .
we have given a very great deal of attention to this issue , and we have also addressed it in the contacts we have had with Ukraine .
there were heroes and there were traitors .
as I now have the floor I would like to point something out to Mrs Corbey : it is not correct to assert that the Chinese are building cars that are more environmentally friendly than those made in Europe and that these are now flooding the European market in their millions .
should it be progressive , as Spain hopes , proportional to wealth , or a head tax ?
Madam President , Commissioner , basically , I am wondering why you wanted to make that statement .
another question in the catalogue of Laeken declarations makes me similarly pensive .
once that has been done then you have the next phase which is completely transparent .
it is absolutely necessary to recognise their professional status and to define their rights .
there have been thousands of cases of people from the HADEP party being arrested , and although the majority have been released following a short period of detention , these individuals were arrested for being suspected members of the PKK terrorist organisation and were accused of being involved in terrorist activities .
working people in all the Union &apos;s Member States but also in the countries about to join have only one way to resist those choices and that policy .
it is vital that Members can enter the campaign for these democratic elections with a clear conscience , and can discuss European issues rather than having to counter accusations .
a small step in the right direction is always better than marking time on the spot for years .
I supported this resolution because it asks the Commissioner for International Cooperation , Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response to ensure that the European Union plays a leading role in crisis situations , coordinating more efficiently the European Union &apos;s response to future crises , based on the responsibilities created under the Treaty of Lisbon .
all the present Member States will be paying the same amount in relative terms towards enlargement , leaving out the special arrangement for Great Britain .
that is one issue that we can all agree on .
in doing so , I do not advocate taking one side or another , but I call on the Thai Government to prioritise a negotiated solution , to ensure that the declared state of emergency does not limit individual freedoms or freedom of expression , which would only exacerbate tensions , and I call on him in particular to consider a return to the polls .
South Korea has to compete with the economic and military giant to the north of it , China , which is , at the same time , the country &apos;s main trading partner .
when climbing Mount Olympus I stopped to taste the Olympian honey , the honey of the gods of Greece .
this Regulation is just a first step , however , a temporary solution until the adoption of a genuine statute for the European parties and their funding , as laid down in Article 191 of the Union Treaty .
the cost of just one week &apos;s operations is enough to run six thousand schools .
you can be what you want to be .
there should be no more freestanding training in Europe , but a commitment that training is always followed by at least one year of work .
we need to give a window of opportunity to these people and provide them with the assistance to sustain themselves as they undoubtedly face the most difficult period economically they have ever faced .
the reason for this is that we have obtained information to the effect that the Commission wishes firstly to contribute more money by way of aid to Macedonia and secondly to extend the period of aid .
in the Committee on Agriculture I also saw motions to delete altogether the sentence stating that we welcome this initiative .
in other words , as specifically intended by the European legislators , the TACIS programme is not totally suited to emergency situations .
since the outbreak of the conflict in the autumn of 1999 , ECHO has allocated a total of EUR 820 000 in humanitarian aid to this beneficiary group .
he explicitly stated that the Union Presidency would take steps to lay the foundations for legislative measures to combat discrimination , producing , in practice , a directive protecting the independence and equal rights of millions of people with disabilities in all aspects of daily life in the new Europe , giving them genuine hope for the future .
because in those circumstances we would have had the worst possible effect on American public opinion as well as on our own .
that concludes the vote .
you have two choices .
basically , that is the challenge facing the Convention , although it is not yet clear how best to tackle it : the challenge of building a political Europe which is able to address at global , at world-wide level the major issues of today - democracy , peace , freedom and development for all peoples , irrespective of race , colour or creed .
as I pointed out in that letter to Mrs Gradin , and as the House will be aware , the Staff Regulations applicable to all EU institutions make it clear that the Commission as an institution and as an employer is legally liable to assist employees in defending themselves against attack .
I am simply underlining that we are trying to work in every way we can which includes a reduction in capacity or fishing effort in our waters and not simply a &apos; transfer of over-capacity elsewhere . &apos;
that is what happened last time , and it happened this week too .
the next item is a brief presentation of the report by Jonathan Evans , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the reports on competition policy 2006 and 2007 .
in fact , however , since then , the United Kingdom has become a net recipient .
serious questions have to be asked about the operation procedures and indeed the training provided by low cost airlines such as Ryanair , Translift and others .
firstly , we need to be reconciled on the subject of our values . Why should those not be the values of the old Europe ?
this situation should have been corrected by the European Council in Berlin but unfortunately was not , with the incredible acquiescence and even approval of the Portuguese Government .
approval of the Minutes
it takes 12 years to build a new nuclear power station .
Moldova is still living proof of this .
that is not all , though .
the title of the report is not accurate .
Mr President , I would like to welcome the two candidates on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group .
these include the drawing up by the Member States of a definition of services of general interest ; even if these definitions are not identical , they will be comparable , and we do not regard this as violating the principle of subsidiarity .
in my opinion , we have been successful , in Mr Aldea &apos;s report , in taking this aspect into account .
in earlier and in modern times , WMD have always been used to subjugate peoples to imperialist rule .
the active participation of these organisations should be very useful in realising these strategies .
we shall be supporting the compromise .
it is becoming so easy to make a good living out of crime at the taxpayers &apos; expense that when we talk about the level playing field , in so many areas of activity involving public subsidies you could say that the level playing field is now crooked .
secondly , we ourselves , the European Union , are still not ready for enlargement .
Helsinki , in Finland , is still further to the east than Üsküdar on the shore of Anatolia .
the Commission proposal for a directive would introduce a ban on the use of certain azocolourants in textile and leather articles that come into close contact with the skin .
I insist that this change should be made so that the budget can be used more efficiently .
in this respect , the British Presidency took the right decision , given that no one would have tolerated two major impasses at the end of a Presidency and Mr Blair wanted to close the 2006 budget in good time so that he would have more room for manoeuvre when negotiating the financial perspectives .
indeed , our Parliament will be required on Wednesday to give its verdict on the revised Commission proposal on common procedures for granting and withdrawing refugee status .
the common position , as it has come back to us , is not a bad common position .
thank you , Mr Colino .
the references to the Treaty of Lisbon , which our people do not want , and the proposal that the putative Commission Vice-President / High Representative should co-chair a new &apos; Transatlantic Political Council &apos; , are examples of this .
but no , this is not the case .
however , the White Paper offers no real strategy in the medium and long term for bringing about a single control system .
- Blokland rightly raises serious concerns regarding waste disposal , including incineration .
on the last occasion , the Council blocked those improvements .
weakness and equivocation merely strengthen those who seek to undermine democracy .
service providers must recognise their role in facilitating access to terminal equipment for disabled users and the framework directive must include , in my opinion , access to terminal equipment and software .
the bulk of the work was done by Mrs Hedkvist Petersen , with me simply acting as a catalyst , and I pay tribute to her persistence in working with your services , Commissioner , to secure a first reading agreement that I am delighted to support .
so much for the procedure : you will have every opportunity to express yourselves , and we will scrupulously respect this - if we did not do so , I think we would get into trouble !
this is the way to tell Irish taxpayers that their money which is now being used for this restructuring , together with financing that hopefully will come after the adoption of the programme from the two European mechanisms , plus the IMF cooperation in this programme , will be returned to them as the positive result of a successful solution to the present Irish problem .
if the outcome of a referendum is not to the liking of the Eurocratic nomenclatures , this does not necessarily mean that the voting public is lacking in brain cells .
( the President cut the speaker off )
that is why Europe must intervene .
is there any opposition to the inclusion of this oral amendment ?
thirdly , a systematic analysis of the economic situation of the EU as a whole and of the individual Member States must be carried out every three or four years and feedback given , in order both to identify any progress achieved and to make it possible to react quickly enough to any problems .
by the by , Mr Kesteleijn-Sierens was asking when Article 12 of the draft directive on savings should come into force ; it says that Member States should adopt legislation on transposition no later than 31 December 1999 which should come into force on 1 January 2001 .
we must go to Hong Kong with an ambitious and balanced proposal which civil society and all the member countries of the WTO can relate to and which will bring results they are satisfied with .
my group is also of the opinion that the Commission proposal is a very attractive one .
there was great optimism after the signing of the peace agreements but , ten years later , the reality has changed very little for people in that country , where 80 % of the population live in poverty .
President Megawati understandably wishes to prevent Indonesia falling apart .
if we want to further the growth of our European film industry and promote the idea of Europe , we not only need better quality , which is already very good but could be even better , but we must also give our creative artists financial assistance .
Europe must allow its safety and rescue teams to work together across national borders .
in the light of the situation in the European Parliament &apos;s part-session this week , which saw proposals made to prohibit TV crews from filming during voting , it is clear that there are many who wish through censorship to prevent the political debate within the European Parliament from reaching the citizens .
it was certainly a turning point .
the lack of a method of calculating infrastructure costs is detrimental to fair competition and encourages discriminatory treatment of users .
but that will not prevent us from raising the question at some stage that the Union needs some sort of constitution , into which fundamental rights should be written .
my group is therefore against the first three applications to amend which were submitted , and in favour of application No 4 because this is a sensible supplement to the report .
finally , the Commission and the European Investment Bank are looking into optimum financial packages for major demonstration projects , and so we also urge the Commission to analyse new ways of combining resources from different sources and to develop an ad hoc tool for financing the commercial launch of low-carbon technologies .
however , in this context , where greater efforts are required to satisfy the criteria for the membership-application process , the suggestion of a referendum is pertinent .
although several major carriers have gone bust and the situation in the sector continues to deteriorate due to rising fuel costs and slower economic growth , there is definitely no reason for panic , in my opinion .
in this respect , there are various speakers - Mr Caveri , for example - who call for the great transport axes which are already in the TENs to be developed .
nonetheless , reducing their accessibility deficit , making them more competitive and achieving regional integration remain appropriate goals that reflect the priorities of these regions .
so we will have to look into that .
Mr President , Commissioner , fellow members , it may only be July , but today , the European Union and the European Parliament come to the Member States bearing gifts in the form of a supplementary budget refunding EUR 3.2 billion to their original owners .
it is also intolerable that the Natura 2000 programme , the real aim of which is to improve the EU ’ s standing by sending out a clear signal that we wish to be an environmental union , and not just an economic union , should be perverted in such a way .
new technologies also contribute towards increasing consumer choice .
thus the progress made with regard to the 26 partnerships is particularly encouraging , in the sense that people who were previously unaccustomed to discussing and taking joint decisions on the future development of their region are now working together in this context .
the task now is to use the texts in front of us in order to promote the convergence of the systems through cooperation and coordination between Member States .
politicians are responsible for establishing these rules and we must not be diverted from this task .
is it best taken in Strasbourg by this Parliament ?
this is of paramount importance , since it underpins the functioning of the whole society and the economy .
the essential thing is the health of European consumers - which was at risk - and we shall continue to defend it .
so the underlying conclusion is that effective multilateralism should be the motto on the European Union &apos;s banner .
so are they the same , or more ?
those who vote &apos; no &apos; on this issue are giving up on climate change and setting our children and our children &apos;s children on the road to ruin , as they will have no future on this planet .
I have complete confidence in Commissioner Kroes , who is going to examine every aspect of this deal .
I am confident that our first report to Parliament on the results of the implementation of this regulation which we present in a couple of years &apos; time will prove that to Parliament &apos; s satisfaction .
my group will never agree to a policy of this kind , but we will do everything we can to encourage opposition to it .
unlike the Commission , I am of the opinion that cabotage must be possible on an international journey as well as on the return journey .
consequently , a comparison with China is important , but I would seriously advise against holding China up as an example for us to follow in our European work .
we will vote against the adoption of this directive .
( EL ) Mr President , my special thanks to Commissioner Mandelson .
I am now looking forward to this Lisbon Treaty , the signing of which in October will perfectly symbolise the end of a particularly disenchanting episode of European integration .
the report , moreover , recognises the Commission ’ s role in introducing simplifying measures , but also argues that those measures are inadequate and proposes , quite rightly , that they be revised .
I would like to make one point quite clear : if we are not careful , something irretrievable will be destroyed and future generations will damn us for it .
I ask you , Mr President , to confer with your colleagues so that the whole range of EU-Russia relations can be investigated , debated and our influence brought to bear not least on the turbulent Mr Putin , who is putting us all in danger .
the first concerns humanitarian aid and the ecu .
many of our requests are in the text : the pillars disappear , the Union has a legal personality , we are going to reinforce the Community method , we have guaranteed the Commission &apos;s monopoly on initiative , a legislative procedure in which the Council and Parliament are on an equal footing will become the normal procedure .
this liberalisation will entail new legislative tasks , especially as regards our obligations in the areas of environmental and climate policy .
I should like to point out that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has approved the proposal , with only one member voting against it .
it would therefore be a good thing if we were able to attain a joint resolution .
when will something finally be done about the water problem in our region ?
four years later and unless there is action , the Commission will continue saying that there is a hierarchy of discrimination , which none of us can accept .
of course , we can add other speakers to the list , but it will be impossible for them to speak during this item .
before we embark on the debate , I would like to ask you all to keep strictly to your speaking time , or otherwise we will have difficulties when it comes to the votes .
because this is no way to conduct a policy to combat employment and the periodic employment statistics published by Eurostat are making a laughing stock of my country because the column headed Greece is always blank .
the response today indicates that they were not , and I commend the Commissioner for giving us this statement today .
this time , Slovenia does not wish to accept this kind of imposition of conditions , and expects understanding and sympathy from the European Union .
the legal position of trainees must be such that a traineeship represents an attractive alternative to a university education and is promoted as such .
I agree with Mr Díaz de Mera García Consuegra in relation to the decisive contribution that immigration liaison officers posted to third countries could , by virtue of their remits , make to Frontex achieving its objectives , especially considering that the agency has no representation outside the European Union .
for example , many of the people who are or were imprisoned in Guantánamo went to training camps for terrorists in Afghanistan after 11 September .
these are extremely sensitive issues , where I believe we have to show some kind of restraint in the comments made .
in this respect , I call in particular on the Commission to look closely into the impact of the Kyoto Protocol post-2012 on our energy-intensive primary industries , such as the steel and aluminium industry and many other sectors , and on our generation of energy .
you have set up an observatory to study racism and xenophobia .
I would like to underline that Mrs De Keyser &apos;s achievements in defending human rights cannot be brought into question in a discussion of this nature .
even if we are unable to harmonise legal systems , clearly , exchanging good practices may be of significant help in this area .
firstly , I want to set out the major guidelines which have determined the way the Council has drawn up this draft budget before going into more detail - though not at length - on the various categories .
the International Atomic Energy Agency has undertaken a safety assessment and was unable to discover this degree of safety in all points .
but , on the whole , the treaty is a good one and this is partly because it recognizes , as some contributors to this debate have not , the fairly modest aspirations of most EU citizens in respect of the growth of European powers .
on the issue of consumer credit , directive 102 of 1987 does not cover new services that did not exist at the time of its adoption .
in order to be in politics , one does not have to be a kind soul or Mother Teresa , one has to be able to succeed in making that region change politically .
that is why we are going to support him but , of course , this gradual implementation seems to me to be fundamental to the consumer being able to accept and take this process on board .
it is unfortunate that the institutional authorities have decided that forestry policy is to be governed by subsidiarity , and that it does not fall within the competences of the Commission but is wholly the responsibility of the Member States .
( applause )
it was very important for us to have an opportunity to say whether nuclear weapons play a role of any kind in the future of the common , foreign and security policy .
as the President-in-Office of the Council has stressed , there was no taboo at Laeken , no issue has been avoided , and I hope that this formula will become a reality , since European construction has too often been opaque , or at least the reserve of the initiated .
in particular , women are often deprived of the right to take part in court cases regarding parental rights .
the Commission must now bear the overall responsibility again .
a permanent stabilisation of the region is in the interests of the European Union as a whole .
will it therefore take the lead in recognising that biofuels are not the answer ?
these countries are increasingly and deliberately being targeted and bought up by international crime and certain dangerous sects , so that a new situation is emerging in international relations as a whole .
according to complaints , the police used excessive force on the two days in question , and took disproportionately harsh measures not only against the demonstrators but against young people , including several foreign nationals , who were on the streets .
the European Union is based on values , rights and responsibilities .
Mr Presidents , the conclusions of the Cardiff summit remain deliberately vague regarding the future of European institutions after enlargement .
Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf &apos;s report is the very model of successful legislative work by Parliament and the Council .
I thank the honourable Members and the rapporteur in particular .
the fact that the Commission is not able to say one word – not even one – on the subject of the thousands who have died between Mauritania and the Canary Isles and on the fact that my country , Italy , still has an unknown agreement with Libya that has been hidden from you and from this Parliament , which has caused the death of a huge number of people in that desert , means that debate about a common immigration policy is still just empty words .
this partnership can only work if it is based on shared principles , balance and a basic trust .
in so doing , we have to make it clear that we are willing to engage in dialogue with all those who seek to hammer out the issues peaceably , but we will wage war on those who do not seek peace .
therefore , the group has endorsed the Hall report &apos;s appeal to the European Commission for the phasing out of energy-inefficient appliances and their replacement with more efficient models .
the banks also bear an economic responsibility , and Basel II must not be misused as an excuse to the detriment of debtors or at their expense .
we shall only retain some degree of credibility , ladies and gentlemen , if the European institutions themselves set a good example .
at the same time , I would like to see a slightly different emphasis regarding the publicising of the Constitution .
in particular , we met representatives from ABB , from Michelin and also the organisers of job marches .
I agree with all the proposed amendments which are predicated upon greater promotion of regional marketing and processing of agricultural products and which help to build up regional markets and create greater transparency , irrespective of the date on which they are introduced .
among other examples , we propose keeping the system of milk production quotas as an essential condition for protecting producers in particularly sensitive countries ; we advocate maintaining planting rights in the wine sector and maintaining aid for the distillation of potable alcohol and emergency distillation ; and we propose setting up a public agricultural insurance scheme , financed from EU funds , to guarantee a minimum income for farmers in the event of natural disasters .
we will now deal with the only item on the agenda , the joint debate on the European Council report and Commission statement on the meeting on 15 and 16 June 2006 in Brussels , and the statement by the Presidency-in-Office of the Council on the six months of work by the Austrian Presidency that is now coming to an end .
you say that cluster bombs and unexploded munitions represent a challenge to former war zones , and that is where I have to contradict you ; on the contrary , they are not a challenge to former war zones , but rather a challenge to the European Union , which must make sure that none of its Member States produces , exports or uses such weapons , and which must no longer permit its allies to do so in the way that the Americans , or the Israelis in the most recent war , have done .
an urgent meeting of the EU-Israel Association Council should be called . On the agenda you should have Israel &apos;s refusal to allow our representatives to meet Mr Arafat ; you should have its wanton destruction of EU-funded infrastructure and its violation of human rights provisions in Article No 2 of the Association Agreement .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Russia has considerable natural resources and a very highly educated population , often better than that of our older democracies .
the amendment details the &apos; advice which may be used in the preparation of specifications for a specific procurement &apos; , that is to say , it effectively sets parameters for a call to tender .
the problem is that , as you perhaps know , one Member State has strong reservations on principle about this whole question . We are currently making very serious efforts to persuade this Member State to withdraw its reservations .
you did not say so in Porto , Commissioner , and you told us as much this morning . The press said it but you denied it - and I believe that - but now you could say it : regrettably , this House has told you today - and I do not know why - that it is not right to earmark a part of the Structural Funds to tackle women &apos;s unemployment .
Echelon is built upon the notion that all telecommunications activities should be able to be intercepted . Surely this cannot be compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights , which states that interception is justified only where a crime is suspected .
whether or not Turkey ultimately becomes a Member depends upon whether the Turks themselves are prepared to implement the far-reaching changes to their society that are required if Turkey is really to become a Member .
currency and interest rates which are here turned into matters of major concern and the driving force of the whole enterprise in a most remarkable way are in reality special factors which are entirely dependent on the above-mentioned major real economic trends .
we have also achieved other , equally significant improvements for third – country nationals .
it is my deep conviction that this will remain as long as Parliament is not invested with the basic powers devolved to any true parliament .
the situation is now out of control and even though the British Agriculture Minister is insisting there is no crisis , the whole of the EU views with alarm what is happening in the UK .
during its negotiations with the EU Council of Ministers , Parliament included new provisions in the regulation , such as those requiring the indication of animal-derived materials in textile products and conducting a study to determine whether there is a causal link between allergic reactions and the chemicals used in textile products .
these components are necessary if we want a solution that works .
but I think that to begin one-sidedly to emphasize personal shares and personal shareholdings as a driving force for increased productivity in this way is extremely biased and very blinkered .
breast cancer is an illness in which proper screening plays a fundamental role , as we know from the statistics at our disposal and as we have heard today during the debate .
I hope that Lukin ’ s opinion carries weight , because he has chaired the European Parliament-Duma joint delegation for many years .
we Europeans have a strong interest that the Russians should do so and therefore make it effective .
that is why we need a better climate .
now you do not want people to be able to seek healthcare wherever they want to in Europe .
by voting for the Simpson report , with certain amendments , we will sending a very clear message to the Commission not to tinker with the universal public service of the postal sector .
it is a fact that in all Member States - and partly as a result of the Maastricht criteria - our electors are being asked to make huge material sacrifices , with the imposition of new taxes and levies .
the Commission is presently looking into the matter to ensure that the freedom to provide services as provided for under Article 49 of the Treaty is respected and any unjustified obstacles are removed .
if it were a matter of changing the agenda that would have to be decided by the plenary .
terrorism cannot be fought in a generalised fashion .
products under those brand names are actually designed in England but made in China , and anybody who doubts that China can produce good-quality products should visit their local model train shop at the weekend and , maybe , like me , buy a present for their grandson .
finally , budget support suffers from a serious lack of transparency and ownership by the countries involved and their populations .
that was what actually sparked off the war and triggered a spiral of violence .
we must avoid being caught up in a civil war between ethnic groups , a crisis situation similar to that in the Congo , which would be extremely dangerous and regrettable for Côte d &apos;Ivoire and all its inhabitants .
the debate is closed .
explanations of vote
free trade agreement with India ( debate )
following the opinion of our Legal Service , this provision presents serious problems of incompatibility with the legal bases and could therefore be annulled by the European Court of Justice .
my group will be opposing Amendments Nos 2 to 5 .
it is to be hoped that as we move towards the creation of defence structures , we will not forget the importance of conflict prevention , and also of continued investment in our policy on democratisation and human rights , because it is abuses in those areas that give rise to conflict in many parts of the world .
do you not see that , with this part of the agreement , you would be discriminating against the local undertakings ?
this conference will hopefully be held during the autumn .
the Commission intends to keep raising its concerns in relation to the draft Anti-Homosexuality Bill and to other actions to persecute LGBT people in Uganda on every occasion .
the French Government has made loud noises about refusing to compromise and has warned that heads could roll .
lastly , the Convention did not have time to update the current wording of the Community policies . In some cases , this dates back to the 1950s and has been partly or wholly superseded .
we last met at his funeral service in December 2009 .
nonetheless , Directors-General should provide more detail concerning the content of their reservations about the way control systems work .
his party has moved forward progressively .
this report shows that , beyond our differences , we have a common attachment to a society which is not solely organised by the law of the market , but by solidarity and redistribution and by the protection of our fellow citizens , that is to say our human capital , the most rich and important capital we have .
this convention will be able to highlight the serious problems facing disabled persons in their daily lives .
it discusses the fact that the text on buses showing the destination should be white or yellow on a black background and at least 12 cm high .
we are all aware of the difficulties and problems encountered by advocates of institutional reform in the UN .
President-in-Office . - ( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , China is a strategic partner of the European Union .
we propose first of all to improve the payments .
its rapporteur , Mr Harbour , has done a magnificent job , but I must not forget that he is a member of a political group whose positions seem more orientated towards defending the interests of companies than towards the operation of the market .
it only remains for me to express the hope that there will be a good attendance this Friday , votes or not .
subject : EU initiatives to save Amina Lawal from death by stoning
I am absolutely convinced that the storey which this Presidency has to add to this Community building will be a match for the ambitious priorities they have presented to us this morning .
those countries and regions that are creative and that are pioneers in various areas are those that offer entrepreneurs the freedom to feel their way towards solutions that politicians or officials cannot normally foresee .
Mr President , we are all opposed to discrimination and violence of all forms .
in this way , the ? U is literally &apos; butting into &apos; negotiations between Member States and third countries and this is fostering European integration and the interests of the European aviation monopolies to the detriment of the Member States &apos; capacity to negotiate independently with third countries in accordance with their national interests in order to achieve agreements which are beneficial to them in the field of their aviation relations .
we now call on the Commission to work towards an agreement , an overall solution , granting a visa exemption for citizens of all European countries on the basis of equal dignity and above all reciprocity .
( the President established that there were no objections to the request )
subject : Proposal for a regulation laying down the total admissible catches for specific fish populations for the year 2000 , and the case of anchovies in particular The latest reports from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea indicate that the current level of anchovy stocks in ICES zone VIII is critical .
the Treaty of Amsterdam established for the first time the Union &apos; s competence in the field of immigration and asylum , and the Tampere European Council agreed that the issues of asylum and immigration , which are different but closely related , make a European Union common policy necessary .
now , as the immediate impact of the financial crisis fades , the G20 faces the challenge of keeping up its momentum for a joint approach to the policy issues that need to be addressed if the world wants to come out of the crisis in a better shape .
nonetheless , we can but proceed one step at a time .
hence the proposal from Professor Pérez Royo for a multilateral agreement with Japan , Switzerland and the US .
at the moment , the European Parliament does not have a single position in this weighty matter .
let us not deceive ourselves : the rule of law and democratic institutions cannot be constructed by corrupt warlords , discredited in the eyes of the people .
throughout the week efforts have been made to block this debate .
at the same time , Austria is one of those Member States who know very well what still needs to be done before we take the enlargement one step further , to ensure that the 2004 enlargement is effective , opportunities are gradually equalised and dissimilarities are reduced .
I am even tempted to suggest that they might use things like the Echelon system to start fighting against these traffickers , but that might be rather provocative in view of the vote coming up on Thursday .
if that is not the case , I shall tell Parliament that there is no adequacy and , therefore , propose that we engage in a bilateral negotiation with the United States .
a working party was also set up between the three institutions specifically to deal with the technical aspects of the proposal in a number of meetings with the Belgian Presidency and the Commission .
yet we cannot ignore that the world is a terrifying place in which the prevention and fight against terrorism is an increasingly important value and objective .
this is where there are grounds for concern , and although it is true that we should be celebrating this outcome - albeit with the reservations already voiced by colleagues - we are also rightly concerned about the future .
Mr President , I did not vote on draft amending budget No 4 , the Pittella report .
furthermore , an important innovation in the new Council Regulation is that the contribution of autochthonous coal to the objective of energy security must be carried out within the framework of sustainable development .
but the Commission will surely agree with me that it is naive to assume that we can stop the renationalization trend unless we have concrete European results at the same time .
you have called for the United Nations to be strengthened and mentioned the UN General Secretary ’ s visit to the European Parliament , which is scheduled for the end of the month .
Madam President , it might help the dignity of the House if the Member nearby could explain what happened .
this brings me on to prevention . The private sector should be involved in resolving crises and should take its share of responsibility .
the first success came during negotiations in Brussels .
indeed , the United States , which we vilify for not ratifying Kyoto , is actually doing better than the EU in terms of emissions trend .
Mr President , Commissioner , firstly I would like to thank you for your interest and dedication to the European Union &apos; s information activities .
indeed , they are the basis of the fact that there has been no violence on the streets in Ireland : it is because the social partners and the government have sat down and made arrangements to adjust the labour market and adjust conditions to ensure that we can have some hope of recovery from the current crisis .
let us put an end to the isolation instead of continuing with the blockades .
at that time , it was finally agreed that wine would be zero rated .
the Commission and the Council belong at the head of a movement fully supporting the Dalai Lama &apos; s five-point peace plan .
very little because the level of harmonisation of copyright in the European Union will not be very high , much lower in fact than in many other less important areas .
I hope that you and your first-rate team will be more successful .
for this reason , the Commission &apos;s initiative to improve the position of combined transport is certainly to be welcomed .
we have a green paper on renewable energy , which we are trying to promote by various means .
Madam President , Commissioner , my dear colleagues , there is no more time now to return to the constitutional debate , especially since Jean-Pierre Cot did it with such brilliance .
- ( EL ) Madam President , as a member of the Committee on Budgets and also as an MEP who comes from a region on the European Union &apos;s external borders , I would like to make three observations :
it is true that , for many years , the Commission has been fighting to ensure that minimum common rules relating to the right of defence are genuinely applied in all criminal proceedings in Europe .
in the intervening period , a number of modifications , particularly technological , have meant that questions now arise as to the degree of realism of the third phase , and in particular the viability of the three year period during which we will have to live as it were on a rack , pulled in two opposite directions - schizophrenically in two minds - between the national currency used in our daily lives and the use of fiduciary currencies already very largely dominated by the euro .
under the previous Rules of Procedure , the President would have had to demand that they be removed .
the establishment of a social union will mean that a framework will be created at EU level for the way in which social security benefits and schemes are to be administered .
the Charter of Fundamental Rights , approved by this Parliament , prohibits any discrimination on the grounds of language or of belonging to a national minority and enshrines the principle of freedom of expression and information without the interference of public authorities .
just as the Commissioner says , we in Parliament , the Council and the Commission must therefore try to find ways of giving economic , political and , especially , moral support to the courageous people and organisations that , in spite of everything , exist and fight for democracy , human dignity and the principles of the constitutional state .
despite this , he too accepted that the inquisition procedure of the War Crimes Tribunal against NATO after applications by Canadian and other pacifist organisations is an open question .
I have also met some Members in person in order to discuss the subject with them .
I also agree with the report &apos;s statements in relation to legislation in this sector ; that is , that this legislation should be proportional to the objective and that no legislation should be brought in until an assessment is made of the legislation &apos;s impact as regards its potential financial burden .
a new orgy of speculation , with borrowing rates hitting historic highs .
more clarity on this in the report would have been welcome .
is this an adjustment to globalisation ?
at the same time , I also support the idea for us to put an end to this situation in a budget-neutral manner by introducing an operating charge .
if the Commission had pursued this abuse of Article 82 as rigorously as it pursues abuses in other areas of industry then this fine would have been not £ 600 but £ 6m or more .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , on behalf of my group I want to express our full support for the joint action by the EU and NATO states , whose sole purpose is to put a stop to the genocide in Kosovo .
fortunately , this practice is falling into disuse , and , in fact , I think it absolutely disgraceful in principle that something like that happened in the first place and that a number of local authorities planned it .
we must not think that the European Union could break up into two groups , each with strengthened cooperation .
turning now to the specific matter of Macao , in my opinion the rapporteur has handled this well because he has understood the specific situation of this territory arising from its history and its particular characteristics .
the Lisbon process too has to succeed .
for twenty years , the Europe of Brussels without borders , in collusion with our governments , has been abandoning our industries to competition from the Asian economies , which practice social dumping , letting in more than a million non-European immigrants each year , practising a genuine form of Malthusianism against our farmers and dismantling our social protection systems and our family policies .
however , another key point based on our experience in the Committee on Legal Affairs is that impact assessments are not actually being carried out as standard on every Commission proposal .
in our opinion , with this level of detail , this Annex should be considered as a technical Annex and frequent and necessary decisions to update it should be taken in accordance with the comitology procedure .
this is firstly because structural reforms cost money and are payable per head , which means that expenses are incurred before any benefits are felt ; secondly , because the nature of national public finances is increasingly less predisposed towards public investment , particularly the least visible kind of public investment that has difficulty attracting party support in the short term ; and thirdly , because the restrictive and blinkered implementation of budgetary consolidation policies blocks any kind of effort focused exclusively on this reforming area , which , given the crucial nature of this area , is clearly an inadequate state of affairs .
I have also supported in principle proposals to move to a multi-annual , multi-species and ecosystem approach to fisheries management and my views are broadly in line with the Commission &apos;s on structural issues .
we start with culture .
the first is the institutional reforms and the preparations for the intergovernmental conference .
the future directive should codify all of the case law of the European Court of Justice applying to the implementation of the principle of free movement of goods and services in the area of public health and it should also add a regulation on the coordination of social systems and provide Member States with the option of making healthcare provision in another Member State conditional on prior authorisation , or the option to apply a &apos; gate-keeping &apos; system .
there is no way to avoid default .
the imposition of a 20 % tax by Russia on imports from Ukraine obviously does nothing to encourage the sale of gas or oil to that country .
Mr President , our group was extremely pleased at the result of the vote this morning .
Mr Purvis , has asked me to pass an invitation to Commissioner de Palacio .
with regard to the ALTENER programme , which is the second bearing this name , we are now confronted with its enlargement and incorporation into the multiannual framework programme for action in the field of energy .
unlike Saddam , Mr Blair , you cannot go to war without heeding the concerns of your own people .
this is why , in my capacity as rapporteur for Hungary in this assembly , I am honoured and happy to ask my fellow Members to support this application , which concludes years of efforts and work and which opens up prospects for a new Europe .
in addition , we believe , and I would like to make this very clear , that the banking sector must be restructured .
- ( FR ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , in the wake of the trialogue between the Council , Parliament and the Commission , the text adopted on 18 December on the pesticide package seems to be well-balanced .
I am sorry to say that women are , in large numbers , the main victims of this terrible trafficking .
the Member States believe that an optional collection rate of 4 kg is the right way to go .
we therefore need uniform regulation , it seems obvious to me , or at least a uniform supervision of regulation .
alien constructs like this risk watering down the fundamental freedoms .
however , if there were one argument for the European Union that would make me change my mind , it would be the argument that the European Union would give us , and would guarantee , peace .
the antidemocratic power in Belarus is concentrated very much in the President .
I would like to finish , Madam President , by saying that we must genuinely strengthen the hand of consumers by offering certainty , guarantees and fair prices .
the document examines the following possibilities for innovative financing : taxation of the financial sector , Eurobonds and taxation of the energy sector .
the establishment of the customs union has unfortunately not moved Turkey to cease its violations of human rights .
I want you to know that I discussed this with all the Member States .
I would call upon all of you , as representatives of the citizens of Europe , to join with me in a minute &apos;s silence in tribute to this cry of sorrow , but also of hope , which has poured forth spontaneously from the people .
for this we need precise regulations , because only such precise regulations can lead to the approval of a type .
mutual recognition , on the other hand , can be made to work more satisfactorily if it is implemented through secondary Community legislation which clearly identifies the areas in which mutual recognition must be accepted .
I repeat , the Europe we want is a Europe that has greater visibility , a will to act , and the means with which to put this will into practice ; it is a Europe that also has the necessary coherence to act , and by this I mean that there must be coherence , within the European Union and in all of its institutions and between the European Union and its Member States so that the entire effort , for example the diplomatic effort , can bear fruit .
there is a wave of human rights violations at the moment and people in the country are acting with complete impunity .
in my view , this has to be reflected to a greater extent in the EIB &apos; s activities .
what is more important is that today we have been handed the death certificate of the CAP , which some Members will welcome .
Parliament &apos;s President reminded you of this in writing at the end of November , I think .
other measures are also planned in order to improve the action concerning products and to facilitate their end-of-life recycling .
this , however , is not to say that we cannot point to early achievements in our aid effort .
for this opens the way to the circumvention of human rights .
the key is to be able to deal with market abuse in a consistent manner .
on the Human Medicines Directive , concerns have been raised that , with the wide definition of medicinal products and the supremacy clause , it is possible that food and food supplements , cosmetics and medical devices could all be classified as drugs .
– Mr President , Commissioner , we would like to commend you for working so hard on this subject .
the Commission is not aware of any evidence that the request from Sweden to the United Kingdom for the surrender of Mr Assange to face allegations of sexual offences indicates that the European Arrest Warrant system is being used for other than its purpose .
we have to make use of this opportunity , or else the prospects for our fisheries in Europe will , in the foreseeable future , be bleak indeed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
by Georgios Stavrakakis , on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control , on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training for the financial year 2009 ( SEC ( 2010 ) 0963 - C7-0226 / 2010 - ;
Mr President , one of the poorest countries in the world ravaged in just 15 seconds , the victim of bad government , the victim of dictatorship and corruption .
the Berlin speeches by Foreign Minister Fischer , visionary and controversial , by President Chirac , controversial but not visionary , and by Prime Minister Blair , neither visionary nor controversial , which threaten to overshadow the memory of the Portuguese Presidency , leave certain questions in the mind which the Portuguese Presidency can still help us with .
we must therefore make it clear to these countries that it is not a matter of pursuing new whimsical policies but quite simply of distributing more prudently the funds that are available .
it is precisely agriculture , of course , which can help in the fight against global warming , especially through new methods of tillage aimed at conserving soil and reducing storage of CO2 , through support for forestry and agro forestry and through support for organic farming .
with this proposal , we are aiming to create a solid basis for the consolidation of the internal market for construction products .
Mr President , on behalf of my fellow-members from the Committee on Agriculture I should like to ask you to change a few things in the voting about the BSE resolution . Obviously one or two things have gone wrong .
unfortunately , modern tourism is very much like visiting a Europe-wide chain of supermarkets that all subscribe to the same principles , namely to be cheap , easily accessible and preferably identical in the majority of cases .
I should like to explain why a Christian can accept EU funding of this research .
there is also Directive 89 / 618 / Euroatom on the provision of information to the general public about measures for protecting their health in the event of a radiation accident .
it has to be said that trust is an unfortunate term to use in connection with a conquered and humiliated nation .
therefore , let me conclude by expressing my special thanks to the European Parliament for its support for the Commission &apos;s efforts towards better financial management of the European Union &apos;s budget .
if we take the case of cyanide , an extremely toxic material , 14 % of the cyanide releases into the environment were caused by transport accidents .
a much smaller number of people know that Hitler was able to do this because on 23 August 1939 he and Stalin had signed an agreement : a non-aggression pact .
this means that we need to inform both the Commission and the Council of the opinions of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in a more informal manner as and when we can and , at a later stage , of the opinions of the plenary too .
no .
these adaptations are necessary to ensure consistency with the proposed one-year deadline for authorisation of plant protection products included in the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market .
secondly , as it happens , the WTO disputes settlement procedure is still in its infancy .
it risks further &apos; noes &apos; , it risks giving the impression that we are proceeding with business as usual without listening , and of course it also poses the question of whether you can easily ask the French or the Dutch to vote again on the same text without further ado .
it is a very serious matter , and I feel it is my duty to condemn it .
we have either met or exceeded all of the proposals made by the Committee of Independent Experts apart from literally a couple of exceptions which , put to the test of practicality , could not be pursued .
this has happened , for example , by introducing the intention now to build a completely new museum for glorifying European history and the European institutions , etc .
the Agenda 2000 proposals are too focused on the acquired rights of the southern Member States , and we must realise that in future the poor regions are going to lie to the east .
my intention was clear : I did not refer in any way to discharges , whether negligent or intentional , within home ports or home waters , and he knows that . He quoted me as saying that the discrimination that would be created between ships of a third country and ships flying Member States &apos; flags was applicable to discharges in home waters , when he knows very well that I did not say that .
however , in cases of non-dangerous preparations containing a substance with a health risk , where information on certain properties is not relevant to the protection of consumer health , simplified safety data sheets need to be introduced for preparations not classified as dangerous , because drawing up and updating full data sheets involve major cost , time and difficulty for small and medium-sized firms which often do not have the necessary human and technical resources .
for this reason , at the Intergovernmental Conference , we should seek to make article 5 of the WEU Treaty a protocol of the EU Treaty to which each state can accede and , specifically , on the basis of an independent sovereign resolution .
Mr President , I too would like to thank and congratulate the rapporteur .
on the other hand , the Commission is aware of the role played by sports organisations on the European social scene .
so that is not the solution to the Greek problem .
the other point is about a policy of granting subsidies to consumer defence organisations .
in the private sector , we must encourage small and medium-sized enterprises , as well as micro-enterprises , which are having particular difficulty adapting to the market , to increase the use of innovative products , on the one hand , and create innovative solutions , on the other .
with regard to small businesses , many of them are certain not to be ready for the full introduction of the new currency .
I voted for this report because I advocate the need for the EU and the Member States to coordinate their various policies on pensions in a more effective way , and to guarantee the adequacy , safety and sustainability of pension systems for women and men .
( applause )
against precisely this background , the European External Action Service will also be established .
whether you are for it or against it , it is extraordinary that such a proposal as this is not subject to the assessment that President Prodi assured the House would apply to all new Commission proposals .
having been rapporteur for the Union ’ s budget , I am well aware that it is not an easy thing to complete a successful budget .
may the European Parliament stand alongside Pope Benedict XVI in taking action against injustice , hatred and violence ; may it , too , take up the fight to secure territorial autonomy for Tibet .
for it to succeed , the administration of the Structural Funds must be simplified and dealt with more efficiently .
I should like to end by thanking once again - because I thanked him in November - Mr Barón for accepting our amendments and I must say that they were purely technical , drawn from the experience of PHARE and TACIS .
I hope that it will put an end to the application of this exemption as soon as possible .
I would like to recall that the EU Charter also states , in Article 51 ( 1 ) , where and when those fundamental rights apply .
the Council &apos;s work therefore needs to be extremely energetic , if we want to prevent blood baths and if we want to prevent further outbreaks of war with unforeseeable consequences .
in this case , because of timing factors , the reports for 2006 and 2007 have been brought together but - taking up one of the points mentioned by Commissioner Barrot a little earlier - it is the case that the context of our consideration of these reports has changed rather markedly , since we in fact began the exercise of considering the report some time ago .
Warrenpoint on Carlingford Lough has been built up , particularly through recent high investment , into a very successful roll-on , roll-off ferry port .
this is an area that is exclusively within the remit of the Member State governments alone , and it is wrong and has been proven wrong many times , that , to use the simple analogy of previous eras , higher taxation means that you can spend more on social protection .
I have therefore tabled this amendment again in the hope that the majority of Members will now understand this point of detail , which is , in fact , more than just a detail .
following the COREPER compromise , only EUR 61 million have been allocated over four years to fund actions in the fifteen Member States .
we will see whether these constitute serious divergences at the end of the debate and the vote .
what does Greece have a duty to do ?
this also means products which have migrated from the professional field to personal use , for instance laser pointers , and secondly products which are used to provide a service .
what conclusions has the Commission already drawn or what conclusions is it going to draw ?
both the Convention and the Protocol go some way towards satisfying these demands , but in the end it is up to the Member States to decide whether or not to ratify the Convention and apply the Protocol . It remains to be seen who ratifies and applies what , and when .
I welcome the conclusion of this agreement on trade between the European Community – which , as many of you have mentioned , is the birthplace of wine – and one of the leading countries in the New World Wine Trade Group .
what we need is a single vision where policymaking can be done in a cohesive and all-embracing manner so as to maximise the potential of these intense and complex interrelations .
so , in the spirit of the age , we would be well-advised to add a personal touch to European politics , and the most politically prominent European figure is and will continue to be the President of the Commission .
I am thinking in particular here of fish and shellfish companies , which have been particularly badly hit .
we need to be aware that this type of agriculture now accounts for an important share of the food market and of agricultural production in the European Union .
Mr President , I am very encouraged by all the contributions made on this very important issue .
it was created to give greater impetus to the process of integration of the European Union by providing the possibility of proceeding on an issue with a smaller number of Member States where it is impossible to reach a unanimous agreement .
on point three , the Commission proposed recently to simplify state aid rules so as to facilitate crisis support .
I think it is really important that we take into account the risks that this person is currently facing .
it is nice to hear the transparency directive mentioned - which I worked on before .
we urgently need climate justice for the whole of humanity .
national innovation policies should be reinforced , developed , and take a more consistent approach across the EU .
the conclusion that an improvement in financial management is needed is to be welcomed .
this is the Parliament that debated this dossier at first and second reading and in conciliation .
in light of this situation , we find it difficult to accept a number of unilateral proposals that were put forward .
the positions of these parties are identical to those which dominate Community policy , insofar as they defend federalism and neo-liberalism .
the news from the USA that ACT has cloned a human embryo has probably shocked us all .
men , girls and boys , are also involved .
yesterday we discussed the Lisbon Summit for the economic and social revival of Europe .
will the European Union accept responsibility for liberating the occupied part of Cyprus ?
take the fixed assets , this building for example . The budget account contained only the expenditure made in a given year .
Ms affects young people at a time in their lives when study , the pursuit of a career and starting a family are important issues .
it is all very well being driven by values and ideals , but we must also be pragmatic and effective in our work .
I believe that that would be a truly European response .
just imagine if the Stalinist regime had had it in their hands .
I think we can all entirely agree on that , but the question is , who is going to do something about the unemployment problem ?
lastly , I referred a moment ago to our obligations to the outside world .
the final arrangements for setting it up are being made this week .
Mr Barón Crespo , first of all , the proposal on the Commission &apos;s programme is usually determined by the relationship between the Commission and Parliament , which is extremely delicate .
I wish to thank the Commission and the Council for their constructive cooperation .
I understand the problems , and we have to find a synthesis and a solution .
Mr President , there are at the moment two crisis hotspots that demand our complete attention and plenty of sensitivity , and the sort of fine words that we currently hear from the present Austrian Presidency of the Council will not make them go away .
I apologise to the House on the rapporteur &apos;s behalf .
more importantly , preparations do , of course , have to be made and you have pointed out - even though the question looks somewhat different from the point of view of the individual institutions - that it should be a matter of interinstitutional concern to address the subject and find a solution .
.
if this is the case , I should like to give the floor to Commissioner Vitorino , who will be speaking on behalf of the Commission .
I do not accept that workers should be forced to work longer as a result of cuts , regardless of who their employer is .
.
the enhanced competence of the European Parliament in the field of the economy , energy , anti-terrorism and fundamental rights is not business as usual .
this is not very orthodox , it is true , but it could be accepted , since there is an exception laid down in the article of the Agreement .
as Mr Pittella has already stated , we must start a new chapter today by reconciling competition with cohesion policies .
in the current context of economic and environmental crisis , more than ever we need a commitment by developed countries to create a new forum for international reflection , at the highest level , with the aim of consolidating water as a public good , sharing technologies and developing efficient , sustainable and economically viable systems of water management .
I also supported the &apos; Eurovignette &apos; amendment ; its review must not detract from the sustainable transport strategy .
I wish lastly to pay tribute to the commitment of Emilia Müller , the shadow rapporteur for this controversial report , who spared no effort to try to improve it .
you can work towards having Irish as a working language of the Union .
within a generation there will be two billion more people on this earth , 90 % of whom will be born into what is now the developing world .
the proposals regarding the widening of police and judicial powers of intervention in criminal cases , as well as the various proposals concerning the creation of a special European judicial area , constitute the cloak under which Europol can strengthen and widen its operational powers and under which repressive national principles can be formulated , thereby seriously jeopardising fundamental democratic rights and freedoms .
options are under consideration and we expect that a Commission staff paper will be available shortly .
I do not believe that this is the case .
and it will continue to do so , although it will not lose sight of the budget &apos;s political significance .
I think it is a shame that we have lost the original concept of free circulation of goods and services in favour of harmonisation , which reduces consumer choice .
I also ask the Commission what became of the &apos; gender desk &apos; in development cooperation .
there is a clear reference to the specific term in Article 18 ( 1 ) allowing the Member States to deviate from the upper limit of 48 hours , provided that the worker is happy to work the extra hours .
the bizarre situation is that if EID comes into force in January , we will know how many sheep we have in the UK , where they are and all their movements , yet in the UK - due to unlimited immigration - we have no idea of how many people we have in our country , or who they are or what movements they will make .
by voting in favour of Mrs Mouskouri &apos;s report on the &apos; Culture 2000 &apos; programme , the ARE Group wished to lend its support to this Commission proposal establishing a single political instrument for cultural activity and cooperation .
I think that we should make that point by incorporating this into the integrated approach .
in conclusion , I believe that this policy is a little like the two-headed god , Janus Bifrons .
having been the head of the European Union Election Observation Mission in Sierra Leone , I really believe that it is our political and moral responsibility to support this court , because it would be truly unacceptable and unimaginable for this court to be unable to continue its work for what are potentially financial reasons .
but the human rights situation remains very difficult and we use the opportunity of our regular , senior official meeting to raise these issues .
the Commission &apos;s document does not contain specific schedules , nor does it describe the methods to be adopted .
what stands out is the crucial role that this House and the national parliaments must have in this area .
Europe ’ s commitment is solid , but without efforts on the part of all key players , no result can be achieved at multilateral level that can make or break the weaker developing countries .
the European Union is doing its part .
we talked earlier about black boxes .
the civilian population are suffering violence as the direct victims of bloody confrontations between armed anti-government demonstrators and the forces of the state .
today , we are discussing in particular the broad guidelines for economic policies .
it is all the more unacceptable given that in my region , for instance , the Nord-Pas-de-Calais , which is hard hit by the restructuring , we are unfortunately well versed in this type of debate , which advocates curbing environmental demands in order , so they say , to protect jobs .
finally , I want to refer again to yesterday &apos;s discussion .
( the sitting closed at 12.05 )
I recall vividly the impact on myself of learning , during a floating symposium on the Black Sea last year , that a very high percentage of the pollution which is killing the Black Sea stems not from the riparian states but from run-off from Austria and Germany of nitrogen and agricultural chemicals , pushed on to the land in the heart of Europe as a consequence of some of our malfunctioning environmental policies in the common agricultural policy and having a consequence hundreds and hundreds of miles away across the continent .
in its judgment of 16 July 1998 in the Silhouette case , the Court of Justice upheld the principle that the holders of trade marks in the Community have the right , on the basis of those trade marks , to object to parallel imports into the European Union of products originally placed on the market elsewhere .
environmental concerns are becoming increasingly important in EU policies in general .
you will notice that the text does not refer to an austerity budget , as it did last year .
7 , 8 , 9 , 11 , 13 , 14 , 19 , 24 , 29 , 34 , 41 , 42 , 44 , 45 , 46 , 76 , 77 , 78 , 80 , 82 , 88 , 92 , 99 , 102 , 113 , 117
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , allow me to share with you my concerns as an MEP from a new Member State .
that is of course unacceptable .
the legal instruments which protect commerce are still blocked by national internal borders .
given this situation and in view also of press reports that have also appeared today , let me point out that it is not the Secretary-General of the Council who is responsible for the tensions we are currently seeing in the General Secretariat , but that the only reason for these tensions is a political decision by the Council that is covered by the Treaty .
there are plenty of opportunities .
it is a recipe for profligacy .
frequent interaction between immigrants and Member State citizens is a fundamental mechanism for integration .
secondly , I wish to point out that the third Annex contains the composition of the committees of delegations , and I would like to ask whether yesterday , when we took a vote on this issue - which is what apparently happened - whether the lists with the names and the composition were available or whether we took a vote without knowledge of the composition . I consider this to be an unheard of sequence of events if no appropriate submission was forthcoming .
this report reflects a sensible budget , aimed at a policy of the sustainability of Parliament .
the report properly details what needs to be done and on what conditions measures need to be tackled .
right at the start I want to say that yesterday in Helsinki the Finnish Foreign Affairs Minister , Erkki Tuomioja , discussed the situation in the region with Israeli Foreign Affairs Minister Livni .
author . - Mr President , the system whereby the EU gives preferential treatment in trade to some countries has been in place since 1971 .
the real challenge faced by the farming industry is to become more competitive and closer to the consumer .
I will not add any more general comments since I agree with what has been said by those Members who spoke before me .
Mr President , we have accepted other oral amendments and so , with your consent and with the House &apos;s consent , but particularly with the rapporteur &apos;s agreement , I would like to propose an oral amendment because the amendment is incorrectly formulated in terms of the law .
for the third time since the Luxembourg Treaty of 1970 and the Fontainebleau summit of 1984 , we are faced with the problem of how to finance European integration .
the Albertini report is a step forward towards a better EU security policy .
the European Union is also responsible , as a result of its policy , for the starvation and misery in the rest of the world .
the next item is the debate on the report by Giusto Catania , on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , on the Future of the European Common Asylum System .
it is not enough for Sinn Fein and the IRA to say they are going to make excuses or give up one person or five people .
I would like to see prioritisation between agencies as well as good support for those that we cover .
I would like to present briefly the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , and I do not want to devote myself to long explanations about why small and medium-sized enterprises are the economic backbone of European society .
project bonds serve as finance for extensive innovation , infrastructure and reindustrialisation projects .
the nuclear lobby was too strong .
the country takes part in the Barcelona Euro-Mediterranean dialogue as an observer , and formally applied for membership at the end of May 2005 .
now that the Treaty of Lisbon has entered into force , the European Parliament will be able to discuss this matter fully , and the Council is ready to provide Parliament with all the information it requires and to establish a dialogue on the matter .
in its current state , reciprocity of sanctions is neither desirable nor appropriate as a response to often complex issues occurring on a day-to-day basis .
in this context , the Prime Minister , José Sócrates , must now offer the Portuguese newspaper O País a substantial explanation , and must explain that he is not controlling , curtailing or censuring freedom of expression in Portugal .
extra national funding is , therefore , the only resort and has to be found .
there are a few strange little things in the text where I think the lawyer-linguists need to look at some of the translation versions .
as was pointed out in our Environment Committee , this recommendation lays down limits for acute thermal effects only .
in any case , we have increased the gap between supervisory body and government .
secondly , where voting rights were concerned , our intention was that subsidiaries would be listed both as part of their parent companies and as independent entities , and we managed that too .
I therefore beg your understanding when I need to interrupt speakers .
if you were to ask me if it was the most efficient decision that could have been taken , then the answer would be &apos; no &apos; .
in some countries , this sector even accounts for more than 90 % of employees .
the detailed information contained in the report should have had a greater influence on the values and strategies laid down by the current MGP IV , which covers the period 1997-2001 .
this adds to the merit of the two rapporteurs , Mrs Scheele and Mr Trakatellis , who have managed to approach very distinct positions and to work out some viable compromise solutions .
you will see , Commissioner , that your persistence will pay off in the end , despite all the resistance you have experienced , right from the very beginning , especially from the scientific world .
personally I believe that many Members of this House wish to be respected and not merely tolerated as politicians , and the fight against corruption is the ultimate test here .
the execution of the budget as a whole at the end of September exceeds the level of previous years , in particular with regard to payment appropriations .
although I believe that Mr Wijkman has drafted an excellent report , I must unfortunately voice my objections once again to the House .
we therefore have a duty to stop every expulsion , including those in Kosovo , and we have a duty to speak up so that the ban on expulsions and the right to a homeland become the foundations of international law , so that such dreadful events are not repeated .
the minister from Pakistan is in Brussels today , he is to dine with Mr Solana and Mr Patten .
it goes without saying that product safety depends mainly on the manufacturers and importers who place products on the market .
I would like to insist on the need for there to genuinely be effective coordination and effective compliance with the commitments established in the Stability Pacts on the part of the Member States and I believe , on the basis of the proposals that have been made here , that if the Commission does not have greater capacity to influence this compliance in an area such as the use of tax policy , for example , the certainty that the objectives will be achieved is really very limited .
that also applies with regard to the energy-saving light bulbs that Mr Krahmer mentioned , which do indeed contain very small quantities of mercury .
by adopting the resolution on economic governance , the European Parliament is reaffirming its main objectives for the negotiations on the Commission &apos;s six legislative proposals .
in this respect , I am glad to notice that our rapporteur , Mrs HAUG , puts the emphasis on the importance of the principle of solidarity as one of the cornerstones of European policies , especially with regard to cohesion and structural policies .
by the way , Russia was the first country where the Commission and the Council Secretariat had a briefing meeting with a restricted number of MEPs as a follow-up to the Valenciano Report , in order to meet your concerns regarding better coordination and information .
forests are a valuable resource for the agricultural sector , the environment and biodiversity , especially in terms of the ecosystems they contain and in terms of soil fertility and protection against soil erosion .
however , when we talk about the EU lagging behind in the number of inventions per head , this only applies at EU level .
we live in a global market , whether we like it or not .
if Russia were to ratify the agreement with the European Investment Bank , which agreement is oriented towards the Northern dimension , the Russians would at once have billions of euros at their disposal , which would make it possible for a fair amount of nuclear waste to be disposed of .
any attempt to reintroduce special provisions or manifold derogations and exemptions will not only make the rules highly complex but will also make them impossible to enforce .
in practical terms , that means that the Stability Pact must not , of course , be called into question , nor must it be subject to intelligent interpretation ; instead , Europe will not be able to produce a lasting solution to the problems of a constantly ageing population and the diminishing options for the young unless all the Member States find a way out of the debt trap .
my own memory of the Rules is that you should do it before votes as well .
I look forward with personal interest to your vote tomorrow .
Serbia has hidden potential which it needs to realise on its road to EU membership , and it must do so in its own interest and in the interests of its neighbours , the region as a whole and the European Union .
now , I will be giving you the opportunity to make good this error tomorrow .
the budget must ensure that the EU &apos;s various political priorities for 2010 are adequately financed .
to seek to gag Members of the European Parliament from expressing their opinions on matters of public interest by bringing legal proceedings is unacceptable in a democratic society .
this is included in the common position .
that company was very quick to change its name to P &amp; O so that people did not realize they were going on the same ships .
the enlargement must take place , but beyond the institutional reforms it is necessary to rediscover economic growth - and perhaps the single currency may not be a good trampoline - because otherwise we risk seriously disturbing the economic equilibria achieved with difficulty by candidate countries like Poland , which is today achieving success with its own development gamble to create thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises .
the agricultural sector is , moreover , well protected from competition from foreign imports . This has a very distorting and destabilising effect on the world economy .
all governments and relevant intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations are urged to strengthen their commitment to women &apos;s health , to deal with the health impact of unsafe abortion as a major public health concern and to reduce the recourse to abortion through expanded and improved family planning services . &apos;
I think that is the easiest thing to do .
following the imminent entry into force of the new system of generalised preferences ( SGP ) , it will perhaps be necessary to carry out a prompt assessment in order to ascertain the scope of the modifications introduced , and Parliament &apos;s control function is going to be extremely important in relation to complex issues , such as the practical application of rules of origin .
perhaps we should respect the public &apos;s right to diversity and freedom of opinion to a greater extent in future too .
good competition policy enables markets to function properly .
the same applies for Iran .
I must reject this strategy of gaining political influence by appealing to popular emotions and fears .
as early as the time of the introduction of the euro I brought this issue to the attention of the Commissioner responsible , Mr Monti , and I asked the Commission to take action on it as quickly as possible .
in conclusion , support to undertakings in developing countries has my blessing , but the line of approach in the case of state-owned undertakings raises essential questions .
the work of the Community complements that of the UN , the OSCE and the Council of Europe .
but then another question automatically arises : who is responsible for unemployment ?
but I wish to underline that they were regular in formal terms only , because we have also to consider all the conditions that existed after the military conflict at a social and general political level , during the electoral campaign and during the elections .
I do think that we should support the attempt , at least , at considering how we can allow debates to be held which have an effect on the public and in which individual MEPs have rights too .
the upgrading of our delegation in Armenia and the opening of a delegation in Azerbaijan in early 2008 will certainly also allow us to increase visibility and operate more efficiently .
it is important to point out that the principles of proportionality , subsidiarity and especially the extended principle of equality of charges for cross-border payments should comply with the EC Treaty , Article 95 ( 1 ) .
but the real responsibility for employment , and this is not the first time that I have stressed this , lies with the Member States .
the report has made it possible for us to review this matter after a long process of energy market liberalisation and , above all , for the European Council of March 2006 to adopt an &apos; energy package &apos; aimed at safeguarding security of supply , competitiveness and environmental sustainability in relation to EU energy policy .
nothing about this is changed by the agricultural reform .
in conclusion , the European Parliament has an important role to play in issues relating to human rights and fundamental freedoms and rights .
how can anyone imagine for a moment that insurance companies , whose sole ambition is to make money , would do better than systems based on national solidarity at financing the cost of medicine - an ever-increasing cost because of technical advances and increasing life expectancy .
it is also right that the group should be strengthened .
to define consultation as &apos; the exchange of views and establishment of dialogue &apos; is far too imprecise .
last year , Estonia had to cut the budget three times and shrink public sector expenses , and further cuts will aggravate the already serious social situation .
we would all consider it impossible to pursue environmental policy without them .
I have already explained that we began by agreeing with the industry , including the Greek industry , that we had 19 million tonnes of overcapacity .
and the question here , Mr President , is who gave Robertson , the NATO secretary-general , the right to move in and pressurise the FYROM government into negotiating with these criminals ?
on this matter I would like to put another question to Mr Kinnock , a question which was not answered in the hearings : will the Committee on Budgetary Control also have access to the same documentation and information made available to the Wise Men ?
- Before the vote :
they should follow the guidelines they have set themselves and enable their administration to apply enacted legislation .
we need ladies at all levels and I wish them well .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Netanyahu and his supporters in Israel make fun of Europe &apos;s claims to have a part to play , and I am not particularly enamoured of the nursemaid diplomacy sometimes practised by Europe , and especially by my own country , France .
how do you explain to the 6 million unemployed French people that they must make sacrifices for the Irish whose unemployment rate is proportionately lower ?
I feel this problem clearly raises the question of the European Union &apos;s ability to determine the rights and statutes of European citizens or future European citizens with regard to the right of asylum , on the eve of the great challenge of the decisions on enlargement .
you have worked very hard in this Chamber today , so thank you for being with us and for giving us such excellent and detailed answers .
I especially welcome the work that has been done on the plan for housing assistance , since housing is the second priority for citizens , after jobs .
but this is a good report .
what is called for , then , is an integrated policy of reviewing all the responsibilities and competences that we have in terms of how we can use the options available to us in such a way as to create the ideal conditions for tourism to flourish in Europe .
Mr President , Commissioner , I too would like to thank the rapporteur at the outset for his close cooperation .
the Union as a whole should therefore monitor whether exporters from third countries include in their manufacturing costs the contributions to be made to provide for compliance with environmental standards and social security for workers in their countries .
we have , then , always respected the specific characteristics of sport .
it is for this very reason that I want to emphasise the importance of Corridor 5 , which links southern Italy , the Puglia region , with Tirana , Skopje , Sofia , Plovdiv and Burgas .
what needs to be done now in order to tackle the disease in Africa ?
furthermore , the EU &apos;s diverse cultural landscape gives us the distinction of being the most attractive tourist destination in the world .
the Treaty of Lisbon stressed the competence of the Union to support , coordinate or supplement the actions of the Member States for the protection and improvement of health .
it is not something that can be left to them .
however , the Commission can accept Amendment 56 , as drafted , together with the associated Amendments 41 to 46 , 48 , 50 and 53 .
Mr President , we need a Parliament whose work is better structured .
if I have understood you correctly , it is now impossible to have a repeat of what we have experienced in the past , namely a shift from category 2 to category 3 .
here is Rhodes , and let us prove here that we are true Europeans , and not when giving lessons to the Commission and the Council .
you just heard what the previous speaker said ; we often see that when you go too far too fast , you achieve the opposite of what you were actually trying to achieve .
as a consequence , they have given up protecting industry , production and national labour .
on the contrary , it should make us more committed to making a clear assessment of the current state of the country and to helping the Algerian people to overcome their difficulties .
their argument is that this ensures fair competition between the Channel Tunnel and the ferries .
Mr Färm took account of flexibility , and in this regard , the Council needs to consider how it intends , in specific terms , to find the money that is needed for the future investments that we have agreed on , because it will not be possible to find it in future years if it continues with the logic it is currently employing .
firstly , are all the parties involved in the trade talks fully aware of just how urgent it is that the Doha round be brought to a good conclusion ?
my understanding is that &apos; britannique &apos; means British , it does not mean English , and therefore it includes all British beef including Scottish beef .
a common and uniform and centralised standard on how you climb a ladder is not necessary and it is an undesirable interference with the way people run their work environment .
on the contrary , Community structures have to be continually questioned and modernised if we want to realise the solemn promise made at Lisbon of a Europe as the most competitive , knowledge-based area in the world .
although the information requirements provided for in the regulations are certainly an important means towards this end , I would like to appeal also to the Commission and say that I too regard Europe-wide information campaigns as necessary , as Mrs Breyer has announced a campaign for a moratorium on buying GM products .
I was sorry to have to abstain from the final vote on the Barzanti report .
whatever one may think about the Bretton Woods agreements , the superiority of the dollar as a reference currency for the entire international monetary system was justified on three grounds .
Madam President , the central question seems to be whether this Parliament and the European Union show themselves to be sufficiently self-assured to confirm Turkey &apos; s status as a candidate .
there is no doubt that Ireland is being sucked into a military union , which wants the support of its own arms industry .
there are too many examples to mention here .
in France , the so-called &apos; internal security &apos; bill drawn up by the Minister for Internal Affairs targets a whole range of actions : the illegal installation of travellers , the holding of meetings in the entrance halls of blocks of flats , aggressive begging , so-called &apos; passive or active &apos; soliciting , explicitly aimed at foreign prostitutes , and all these things constitute offences which attract heavy fines and , in some cases , prison sentences .
in the light of this , the majority of my group will be voting against the joint resolution .
for instance , in the Data Retention Directive , we left it to Member States to decide if they would compensate telecoms companies .
for those who have expressed concern about the survival of the common law system : that is the system that I have worked in myself for 27 years and I have some attachment to it .
I have talked about what happens initially , when drawing up Community texts , and what happens downstream , when they are implemented .
that is why Mr Bertens appears on the list of speakers a second time , and indeed , he will be taking the floor for a third time later on .
Mr President , on behalf of the Spanish Socialist delegation , I should like to express my appreciation for the tributes paid to my colleague today by so many Members of the House , not all of them Socialists .
add to that our 14 heads of mission who will be on red alert .
in light of this , the EU has agreed to extend pre-accession aid by providing financial support for decommissioning up until 2006 .
for the Youth in Action programme , the sum at current prices amounts to EUR 885 million .
more generally , bus and coach passengers are , on the whole , less well off .
thank you very much , Mrs Bjerregaard .
I also believe that the work of the European Central Bank in other areas is of great importance , especially where small and medium-sized enterprises are concerned .
in saying this I certainly do not wish to oppose the proposal , if some Member States want to do this .
almost ten years after the Cairo Conference , this own-initiative report providing an assessment proves to be timely , and the rapporteur emphasises this by calling for the debate to be held on 8 March , coinciding with International Women ’ s Day , particularly because the report is concerned mainly with women ’ s reproductive health .
we will not achieve this by saying &apos; yes &apos; , as we did in Maastricht , to the Treaty of Nice or by saying , as we did in Amsterdam , &apos; yes &apos; to the Treaty of Amsterdam , and nor will we achieve this by contributing to bringing the enlargement process to a standstill . What we must do , therefore , is engage in positive cooperation , in order to ensure that enlargement does actually take place .
this reminds me of what happened when Germany invaded France and it is completely unacceptable ; this situation leads to a logical reaction against the occupying army , against the occupiers .
however , my question refers to the Convention which is being set up to look at the future of Europe , at which no Scottish minister or Member of the Scottish Parliament will be present .
without its military support , the humanitarian aid corridors that have been prepared will remain closed , and the deaths will continue .
I feel , however , that it was in the Conference of Presidents that , as far as I am concerned , I was really able to appreciate your qualities .
since the Commission &apos; s own papers make it clear that horizontal cooperation agreements are generally not made in order to work against the interests of consumers , I would be grateful to see what the Commissioner &apos; s response is in that particular area .
this is our view as well : Europe must be able to develop an effective foreign policy which is in line with the fundamental values which we always claim to hold : respect for international laws and human rights . In terms of Palestine , that means upholding the UN Resolutions .
this agreement will be the first formal basis for an agreement to be concluded between the Commission , the European Space Agency and the European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation , EUROCONTROL , for the joint development of a global infrastructure for satellite navigation .
the Office of Presidency will meet at 5 p.m. today and the agenda includes the appraisal of a Dutch television broadcast acknowledging that two of our colleagues had made at least two mistakes , may extend the discussion to the fact reported by Mr Cox as well .
the second group are women over 50 , who are seen as less productive and less creative .
a joint and unambiguous declaration by the three largest institutions of the European Union is an exceptional opportunity to achieve a political consensus on the way in which the European Union should react to the increasingly complex crisis situations emerging around the world .
the effects would have been much smaller if there was fiscal responsibility , and Romania would not have entered the first year of the crisis , 2009 , with a 5.4 % budget deficit at a time when , just one year before , it reported record economic growth .
we very much look forward to welcoming Croatia - as has been said - as soon as it has met all the criteria .
that is the heart of the matter .
the Europe of yesteryear , of nationalism , division and anachronism has no geographical basis , it is not located just in certain countries , it is in the mind and in political acts all over Europe and the European Union , and that is where we must fight it by political means .
the Commission must aid public authorities in the migration process by developing integrated and synchronised national migration plans .
he has also referred to an industrial lobby in his constituency , which successfully persuaded him of the alternative .
that does not seem to be the case .
the difficult task of achieving coordination between Member States on this subject will fall to the European Community .
.
the situation in Budapest is particularly bad , and therefore I considered it important to support this report , although it contains several objectionable elements .
I fully support the idea that the equal and full participation of women in the political process and in decision-making should fully reflect the true make-up of society .
I would also add that this not only applies to 2009 but earlier , in the United States , Europe and all over the world : in Barcelona in January 2008 , in Germany in the summer of 2007 , in London after the 7 July attacks and in the investigations into the 11 March attacks in Madrid , the Bangkok killings of April 2005 and the Bali bombings of 2002 .
in addition to the delays in publishing the results , there were a large number of complaints from all parties , including the party in government .
nitrate levels in the environment are far too high , and it will take tens of millions of guilders to clean up our drinking water . More certain still is that by the year 2002 the Netherlands may face a fine of 500 000 guilders a day .
Hastings and Rye MP , Mike Foster , has brought to my attention the need for the Marine Fishing Agency and the Commission to end discriminatory and distorting practices , especially in the catching of cod along the UK south coast , and particularly his own constituency Hastings and Rye , which we both represent .
in my report , I put forward the concept of the active life-cycle to stress the need to consider a period of active life of around forty years - though it is up to the Member States to decide - of continuous employment , training , requalification , potential promotion , from the beginning to the end of a person &apos;s active life .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I myself run several SMEs in France , and it is in that capacity that I offer these comments on the reports before us today .
does he agree that in due course , once we are in a new context , we will have to return to the question of the text and what to do about it , if not in 2006 , then in 2007 ?
all this Parliament wants is a clear and comprehensible system .
five countries in southern Africa have presented alternative plans .
the solution put forward with the amendments , which we urge Parliament to adopt en bloc , is a compromise solution , but I feel that it is a useful , appropriate compromise in that it will allow us to move forward quickly with the creation of the .eu domain .
so why not establish it directly in euros ?
any attempt to continue to use the UN to get the USA &apos; out of a fix &apos; and to continue the occupation is bound to fail .
however , no one in their right mind would believe that Israel was seriously threatened by these statements and that the &apos; solidarity &apos; of the European Parliament is needed .
widespread corruption among politicians and the judiciary has meant a failure to tackle organised crime directly connected to the Balkan route .
I have always been a passionate supporter of a minimum income in all Member States , and I have written it into all the reports I have ever done on social inclusion , but I believe the best way of achieving this is through an exchange of best practice .
if we are serious about making the European Union work , then we owe each other solidarity .
the definition does not expressly state that the rules in actual fact apply to all establishments that cut and otherwise deal with raw meat .
the European Union has a lot of work to do , as recent data presently points towards slow economic development within the Union .
that is why I would say that there is no point in today &apos;s debate unless it motivates an active involvement of the European Union in the restoration of normality and international legality to the area .
we believe that this is irrelevant in the current political situation in Western Europe .
in the case of Albania , the solution involves sending in immediately the international force that has my support , and I shall be voting for the resolution notwithstanding the view of my group .
( applause )
the Commission will continue to emphasise this obligation to manufacturers and to monitor the controls carried out under the responsibility of the competent national agencies in order to safeguard compliance with current requirements .
could you please check exactly what happened ?
I want to thank both of the rapporteurs for their input in this very important area .
much of it is noteworthy .
it is armed with this wealth of exceptional experience and with the values that you uphold that , today , you assume your new role as President of the European Parliament .
when the text was first discussed , critical comments were made with regard to the statements relating to the Commission .
I am speaking for the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights in this respect .
no one can remain indifferent to this global problem when they know that 40 million people die every year of starvation and that a child dies of malnutrition every six seconds .
I warn the Americans to adopt Mr Oberstar &apos;s motion , for if they want to undermine this agreement with all their unilateral amendments , we will react sharply .
the solution is linked to the will to affirm the role of the European Union in the recovery and development of countries like Ukraine where distortions linked to the move from a state economy to a market economy persist , distortions which are a burden on daily life .
as ground water recognises no borders , it would be more efficient if the Member States had a uniform framework regulating the chemical state and quality of water instead of each country having their own standards .
if you take a look at that part of the sitting over which I preside , you will see that , at the precise moment the time allotted to you expires , be the speaker male or female , I advise you .
but it is our duty and it is in our own interests to have the new countries admitted as quickly as possible .
in May 2004 the EU Council promised to end the isolation of Northern Cyprus , but has done little about it .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - Madam President , can I congratulate my friend and colleague Raimon Obiols i Germà on this report .
this exclusion is specified in essential safety requirements and will be taken up in a mandate which the Commission will give to the European Standardisation Committee after the adoption of the directive .
freedom of opinion ? – yes , that is self-evident , but the opinion must accord with the views of the Member in question .
why have they not up to now been involved on an equal footing in the planning and decision-making processes ?
that is why we stand ready as a partner and as an intermediary ; that is why our good offices are at the parties ’ disposal .
let me now turn to Iraq , where I believe there are great dangers .
many people cannot make those investments of their own accord .
nobody needs a Bosman Mark 2 .
the fact that three EU Member States - Denmark , Finland and Sweden - are Arctic countries accounts for the Union &apos;s interest in ensuring that environmental factors are henceforth taken far more into account than they are at present .
we would welcome an initiative by you to ensure that the European Road Safety Agency is presented at the earliest opportunity .
Mr President , I want to thank you for this very substantive and responsible debate which is so important for the future of Europe .
with regard to the new financial perspectives , we want them to have a five-year lifespan to coincide with Parliament &apos;s and the European Commission &apos;s terms of office .
many of these projects are implemented by NGOs and are intended to improve the scope and quality of social sector services , particularly in the fields of primary education and health care .
although it would have been better if the British minister , Mr Hogg , had appeared in front of the Committee of Inquiry , I think it is an over-reaction to want to compel the members of the governments of Member States to appear at a Committee of Inquiry of the European Parliament .
recently , the European Community signed the protocols on soil protection , energy and tourism , and they now need to be ratified .
I place creativity alongside education and innovation .
Mr de Grandes Pascual raised the issue of sea basins .
I believe we should concentrate on raising awareness of this problem , and the European Parliament has played an exemplary pioneering role here .
it is therefore harmful .
the outcome of Bonn represents a victory for multilateral international relations .
our internal procedures are often too complicated for the EU citizen to understand .
the Commission is just an executive body and cannot have the role of legislator .
although the latest armed clashes have once again frustrated the quest for harmony and made one wonder if there is sufficient faith and political will among both parties for peace talks , important steps in the right direction also appear to have been taken .
I see this report as a seed at least .
respected colleagues , the Internet is the great sea : the ocean that must unite Europeans in freedom .
in the Lamassoure report , we are defending the competences allocated to the EU .
as the author is not present , Question No 28 falls .
thank you for your attention .
it would be worth relaunching this idea .
this is a serious incident and we must respond to it with specific measures and , I would advocate , an internal inquiry as well to find out how this can possibly have happened .
that is a recipe for gross exploitation .
I would just like to respond to the idea of introducing export refunds .
I am therefore unable to accept those elements in the existing proposal , but we shall consider them further .
that includes adapting the system of classification to existing international practice and revising the technical annexes , which are no longer up to date .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , once again , a woman , Mrs Amina Lawal , has been sentenced to death by stoning in one of the Muslim states of the Federation of Nigeria .
therefore , it can be misleading .
this is repulsive most of all in social terms .
the third message from Bonn concerns globalisation .
it is therefore , first and foremost , national aid to the timber industry which is the most appropriate means , at national , regional or local level , of supporting the worst affected forestry sites in the industry , and the Member States have to decide on the procedures for providing this aid .
it is disgraceful , having two sets of standards , two yardsticks .
we must listen to the Irish , we must learn from their vote and we must treat the people of the other European nations with the same respect .
this is a pity .
for the moment we must consider the vertebral column to be risk material , in all Member States .
thank you for your kind attention .
the division of the Commission into Commissioners that are accountable and non-voting and , therefore , unaccountable will weaken the Community dynamic and shatter the image of the Commission as a College with drive .
this arrangement will not only enable the enterprises in question to save time and costs amounting to around EUR 2 000 per company ; it is also a very good example of how Europe is more citizen-friendly than many people believe it to be .
despite this , and precisely because this is one of those cases , I would like to express my total support for the Commission &apos; s proposal and the amendments presented by the competent committees , which propose a defensive and temporary mechanism in the ship-building sector in order to confront the unfair practices of South Korea .
lastly , it is gratifying to have obtained a legally sound solution offering European citizens procedural safeguards such as observance of the inter partes principle , the presumption of innocence and the right to be heard , and which obliges the Member States to comply with those safeguards before taking any measures aimed at restricting internet access .
we have to go through difficult times , but we need to work harder for the load to be spread fairly .
( Parliament approved the Commission proposal )
when the fever subsides , they may rest and rejoin the grown-ups .
it is incumbent on European companies to stop banning trade union organisation and rights of association for workers and local people . On the contrary , they should encourage such activities .
so do we consider the prospect of full membership to be a necessary precondition of cooperation ?
in view of the lack of dialogue with the Council and because we have no faith in its capacity for reaction , we have been obliged , with the general rapporteur , to table some amendments - the ones we call strategic amendments - which use up the ceiling of the various categories .
data from the Bank for International Settlements shows an enormous increase in international financial activity , which practically doubled in the 1990s , with trading on stock exchanges appearing increasingly disconnected from the real economy .
confronted with economic issues like these , I acknowledge with Mr Bangemann that prudence is the mother of safety .
we must call on the Laotian Government to allow international and non-governmental organisations free access to the areas concerned – that is the only way those people will get the food and care they need – and , above all , press the government to integrate these populations into Laotian society with the fundamental rights and freedoms they have been denied until today .
amendment No 35 and 36 concern complaint schemes and out-of-court redress mechanisms of the proposal .
the civilian population is naturally the victim , but those responsible have never been punished .
in fact , when the Kingdom of Spain acceded to the European Community in 1985 the door was left open for an amendment of the status of the European model for the Canary Islands .
one point I want to raise : 5.9 % of expenditure .
I must begin by calling on Parliament to have a little modesty .
maybe for this reason alone , it is worth adopting this measure , which is not a European law on takeover bids .
the next item is the debate on the following motions for resolutions :
we should make sure that our policies help people to stay in their own countries .
clearly , as a global player that has done its share in the past , we should now play our part again in response to what is clearly a global problem .
on the Rosado Fernandes report ( A4-0214 / 97 )
( FR ) Mr President , I wish to thank Mr Goerens for having taken into account international standards concerning the health and safety of workers and international environmental standards , especially those which relate , of course , to exposure to pesticides .
the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a legal instrument for encouraging the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community creates a specific financial instrument for an amount of EUR 259 million , to be implemented from 2004 to 2009 .
( the President cut off the speaker )
what are these circumstances ?
today , many of us hope that the women of Iran will regain the freedom to wear what they want , the freedom to laugh , the freedom to listen to music and the freedom to hold an opinion and , for example , to hold office as judges .
great strides have already been taken from an Irish perspective and this is a model which could be used in other Member States of the Union .
the European Parliament must be consistent and strengthen its vote given at first reading .
I am registered as voting against that amendment when , in fact , I wanted to vote in favour .
we would like to see that reduced by at least 1 % to 2 % .
I nevertheless believe we could all agree that , although a family may look different , what is important is that the child receives love and care .
written statements ( Rule 142 )
nothing is said about foreign debt .
secondly , I read in the resolutions signed by my Flemish and Walloon colleagues that there must be a crackdown on trafficking in children , and I even read that the socialists talk of , and I quote : &quot; the severest possible penalties &apos; .
if binding targets were set , however , households could save up to EUR 1 000 annually , according to figures from the European Commission .
the amount concerned has been placed in reserve while we awaited a decision .
the main landfill in the autonomous region of the Azores &apos; application to the Cohesion Fund constitutes a policy that could well serve as an example to be followed .
to this end , it is not sufficient simply to increase investment in R and D. At the same time we must guarantee the excellence of research , ensure that we have sufficient qualified personnel , greater coordination of resources and better coordination of policies with the Member States , and continue to improve the business environment , mainly by modernising our SMEs and creating new ones on the basis of knowledge , so that excellent R and D in nanosciences and nanotechnologies is converted into new products and new processes .
finally , bearing in mind that the European Parliament &apos;s opinion is required to sign any international treaty , it must be involved and consulted right at the initial phase of any project .
therefore , the fact that Europe pays , but is incapable of using political pressure to ensure its objectives are put into practice , shows that there is a need for a common foreign policy with common structures . This applies not only to human rights but also to other problems , and here , if you do not mind , I will turn to the situation in Algeria , as another example .
finally , I want to say that , as our various parliaments around Europe enter their summer recess , there is an issue which I think we have to take away with us , namely the issue which , in all likelihood , is to be a feature of the debate about the future : that of how we are to make the European Union more open and more results-oriented and of how it is to be brought closer to our citizens .
choosing to adopt the plan perhaps a few weeks earlier , but without the full support of all parties , may not be the most helpful way to achieve the goals we all believe in .
it is often a harder , more protracted process to resolve them subsequently and the result is mutual disappointment .
I know this is one of the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency and this is something I applaud .
the decision to end intra-European Union duty on tax-free sales from June 1999 was taken by the Council in 1991 and I am not aware that this issue formed part of its deliberations at that time .
finally , there needs to be a detailed and ceaseless preventive policy and the European Union now needs to act proactively and not simply react to tragic incidents .
these are all principles that were clearly stated in our negotiating positions from the first day and that the Commissioner , Mr Mandelson , has himself confirmed on several occasions .
Mr President , Belarus is a country which shares a border with the European Union but which seems to be 1 000 light years removed from it .
at the same time , we need to express our constant opposition to the stand of the Putin administration on preventive military intervention , just as we have consistently done on the US doctrine of the Bush administration .
however , as she herself did , I would like to point out a few problems which , in our opinion , are still important and which need to be remedied .
in this respect I am pleased to say that the Council has adopted our idea that we have developed in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection .
I voted in favour of the report after the Committee succeeded in ironing out the accusations and misjudgments to a certain degree .
that is why the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe will support Amendments 42 , 43 and 44 .
on the Dybkjaer recommendation ( A4-0235 / 97 )
this is vitally important for the future economic development of the European Union and if we are to ensure that the EU becomes a global leader in the fields of research , innovation and science .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we had the opportunity to congratulate our President on his new office on 15 January , and I want to do so again today .
notwithstanding my concerns , I gave my support to this resolution .
I say more or less , because we must acknowledge that , in spite of everything , the gap between the rich and poor continues to grow inexorably .
I would also like to point out , however , that we , in this Parliament , should make joint efforts with the Commission to support the Irish presidency .
first of all , he sees European bureaucrats under every bed , I think , but , as far as foot-and-mouth is concerned , it was the UK Government that was absolutely determined to slaughter .
I voted in favour of the European Parliament joint resolution on the Danube , proposing that a European strategy be drawn up for this region as a matter of the utmost urgency .
to conclude , there are individuals amongst the candidates who have against them the appearance of having been involved in some way in fraudulent practices .
I have voted against the motion for a resolution because it determines in advance that the EU will make large amounts of funding available from the start without waiting for the other partners .
ultimately , therefore , the same number of culprits must be tried .
with more than EUR 3 billion in commitment appropriations for 1995-1999 , MEDA I actually committed just over EUR 2 billion in its first four years and actually paid out EUR 553 million , or scarcely a quarter of the credits committed .
at the same time , we would be interested to learn more from Parliament how it sees the JPA &apos;s role and functioning in a changing political and institutional environment .
I fervently hope that democracy will triumph in Cuba and that the admirable Cuban people will regain the freedom of assembly , the freedom of association , the freedom to demonstrate , the freedom of speech , and the freedom to travel beyond their island .
that is why , before the Commission tables a Marco Polo III proposal , we really need a general debate so that we can reintroduce all these points which are necessary to our future orientation .
that political solution would then make it possible to implement the provisions of the accession agreement throughout the island .
I agree with you , Commissioner , when you say that there is no contradiction between these two terms , and that they should both be perfectly achievable .
Mr President , the negotiations between the two communities are going wrong .
the Commission has proposed a negotiation strategy based on three pillars .
this is not the first time that the left-wing groups in this House have sought to misuse the human rights report in order to make abortion more freely available .
this spring I will present a Green Paper on energy efficiency , outlining the concrete measures to be taken at Community , national , regional and local level that will lead to those savings .
it must not be the case that protecting human rights somehow condemns people to death .
I can understand that Members have concerns going beyond the proposed directive with regard to material other than textiles or leather and I would like to address those concerns .
for the first time in the history of our Parliament , a motion of censure against the European Commission has obtained a number of votes which is close to a simple majority , and these votes come from all the political groups and all the Member States represented in the House .
Mr President , I have a complaint .
in answer to a written question , you have admitted that you have absolutely no idea , and will first of all have to assess the risks , for example the risk that genetically modified maize might be being imported illegally into the European Union .
( ES ) Madam President , before we begin the vote on this report I must say that along with the rapporteur , Mrs Panayotopoulos , and the other rapporteurs , I have an oral amendment to propose regarding the first amendment to paragraph 6 .
similar thinking instructed my delegation &apos;s decision to vote against Mr Martínez Martínez &apos;s other report on structural measures .
it is often forgotten that these people work in a very dedicated way .
in the final analysis , it is the agricultural industry that pockets the savings , while the small farmers receive less for their yields from sugar beet .
we are constantly given different explanations . It will happen .
the first of them is that – as I see it – Parliament holds fast to the one-stop-shop principle .
that is why I voted in favour of immunity .
then , one month later , you probably read that a FIFA representative declared , in Singapore , if I remember correctly , that he was going to contact several European Prime Ministers in order to resolve the problem . In other words , they were going to bypass the Commission for they were tiresome , these Commission officials who dealt with such problems .
even though it is fundamentally improper that we should be debating the Congo at this point in time , let us , here in this House , congratulate the Congolese people and its independent electoral commission , whose dedicated work , patience and tenacity have made this first electoral round a success .
subject : Construction of a nuclear power station in southern Morocco Is the Council aware of the fact that a nuclear power station is due to be built in southern Morocco for the purpose of desalinating sea water ?
I urge the governments and people of both countries to continue their reforms , but to those who doubt their readiness I ask , would they be better off and would we be better off with them outside ?
the existing legislation does not cover these issues because it is not just a question of patient mobility .
through adopting this , the EU will , at last , accept official responsibility as well for closing the gap for the Roma .
I am astonished at the proposals for customs officers to wear the European Union emblem on their uniforms and for the creation of a single Community customs service , which are purely symbolic gestures amounting to nothing more than window-dressing .
. one could write a great deal on the question of relations , in particular trade relations , between the different countries comprising the EU and China , a country with a population of some 1.3 billion .
if this word is not deleted , then we will vote to reject the amendment .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , like other Members from the region , I was in Toulouse at the time of the explosion .
one such off-limits zone could be the fight against terrorism , which should be based firmly on respect for international humanitarian law .
and it will be extremely difficult to intervene from outside , because the human right of freedom of expression is simply declared illegal .
this is absolutely scandalous , since an enormous amount could have been achieved with this money had it been spent on development aid , or on fostering economic development in the rural areas of these regions .
the proposal intended to create legislation providing for partial retirement as an instrument to enable older workers in the labour market to take voluntary later retirement , without undermining the need to speed up the reforms of the pensions system , is , therefore , very welcome .
it would be cynical to talk about linguistic diversity without putting these languages on the same footing and would constitute discrimination against the linguistic rights of European citizens .
I would also like to answer the point on State aid guidelines for shipping in 2010 .
this is no way to dispel the deep distrust that prevails between the international community and Iran .
the monument has been damaged and daubed with paint sixteen times to date , most recently just over a week ago .
following recent events and their impact on health , we need to extend action in order to deal with unforeseen threats and new circumstances .
I believe that the European Commission has also been able to meet the demands of the circumstances , and I would like to acknowledge that here : the use of the flexibility instrument and the EUR 197 million it proposes for funding demonstrate this .
four of the countries in the Council of Baltic Sea States are Members of the European Union .
this report by Mr Pomés Ruiz also sets out very clearly what needs to be improved : the presentation , the content and the organisation of the information .
none of the arguments presented is convincing as they start from false premises .
question 4 : Before the Commission enters into a binding contract with the Belgian Government , we will naturally provide the budgetary authority with an analysis of the outcome of the negotiations held with the Belgian government .
I would like to ask the Commission why we in the European Parliament have not been informed that this has been discussed ?
I appreciate that this is a very emotional debate , but I would be grateful if you would limit yourselves to the allotted time .
GMOs are an issue that has been raised already .
subsidies for tobacco cultivation should be abolished as soon as possible .
in writing . - ( RO ) The initiative of clarifying the regulations concerning airport charges and the development of transparent , non-discriminatory procedures for the calculation of these charges is welcome , because it prevents any abuse on the part of market-dominant airports .
I would point out that one of the European Parliament &apos; s priorities is precisely to eliminate quickly the difference between commitments given and payments that have actually been guaranteed .
this second report begins with a positive message .
I know many Member States include driver education in their basic education system , but for those that do not , this directive will make it possible for all drivers to receive proper training .
many of you mentioned that this is the fastest-growing waste stream .
the Commission needs to focus properly on these two elements in the Action Plan , and the Member States need to give their full support to installing the infrastructure needed to make it happen , if necessary , through public procurement contracts .
the Lahti Summit , however , also let it be known to Mr Putin that at the meeting in November , at which President Barroso , High Representative Javier Solana and I will represent the Union , we will be speaking on behalf of the entire Union .
there is no doubt that reconciling conservation of stocks with the need to maintain a strategic position in the fishing sector is a complicated and difficult issue .
I suspect that I was over the limit on Monday on the bus from Basle Airport to Strasbourg !
I support Mr Bösch &apos;s suggestion that the appointments committee should be chaired by an independent figure .
however , we are introducing flexibility , as we have fixed thresholds for micro-companies , employing less than 10 people , which must be precisely adapted to the situation in the islands you mentioned .
I urge the Council to be resolute and finally place Hezbollah on the European list of terrorist organisations .
the result will then quite simply be - and I am estimating that there are 2 000 parliamentary assistants - 2 000 additional European Parliament officials .
European , national and local efforts alone are not sufficient for dealing with global problems .
there is no problem between Parliament and the Commission .
in any case , our efforts over the coming three months will be equally devoted to both these things , and I would like to say a very warm thank-you to your House for giving its attention to many of these practical matters .
.
it is , moreover , an initial source of financing for new programmes and a final one for old commitments .
we would be in the same position , with other countries continuing to explore as they do now without using the rigorous standards that we would be applying .
this financial crisis can probably be averted by coordinated cuts in Western interest rates , by collective action to help third countries financially where they can use it , and by better international regulation and prudential supervision in the banking sector .
B4-0459 / 99 by Mr Newens and others , on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists-B4-0467 / 99 by Mrs Maes and Mr Dupuis , on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance-B4-0470 / 99 by Mr Pasty and others , on behalf of the Union for Europe Group-B4-0474 / 99 by Mr Miranda and others , on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left-B4-0478 / 99 by Mr Bertens , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party-B4-0494 / 99 by Mr Cunha and others , on behalf of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party-B4-0510 / 99 by Mrs Hautala and others , on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliamenton the situation in East Timor .
Indonesia &apos;s recent behaviour does not give us great cause for hope here .
in writing . - ( DE ) As was the case with the last proposal to increase the budget for 2011 , I have also had to oppose this one in the interests of the citizens of Europe .
the embargo must remain in place , without any relaxation , for as long as human rights abuses continue .
perhaps there is a Maoist lobby at the Commission , I do not know .
firstly , Member States can simply decide to accelerate the timetable for reaching the 0.7 % GDP target and indeed go beyond it .
nevertheless , we are pleased that this programme has turned out in the way that we wanted it to .
two principles should guide us in this . Public or mixed economy choices should balance market forces .
the Council is taking the action I referred to , precisely because it considers that there are serious problems with the human rights situation in Chechnya which need to be addressed , and it is bringing all the influence it can to bear .
before the vote :
in the last two decades exports from Latin America have increased by 300 % whilst the gross domestic product in those countries has only increased by 3.3 % .
it is important to bear that in mind .
it includes concepts that are innovative , such as reversed qualified majority voting and the fining of Member States , and ensures that national budgets are no longer a matter merely for national parliaments .
strong European support is badly needed to moderate groups in Iraq .
sustainable economic , social and political development in Africa is a common concern , essential to Europe ’ s future .
investments in energy efficiency will help revive the European economy today , because they will create almost as many jobs , and maybe even more , than investments in traditional infrastructures .
I now turn to another subject .
the European Parliament has just given way on three vital issues , in circumstances I consider shameful :
in the foreseeable future , as long as the budget is financed by the Member States , this principle means in practice that financing must take place under the same conditions for all concerned .
however why could it not be possible at a given moment for countries like mine , where there are hundreds of young conscientious objectors without any prospects , for them to do this European voluntary service and thereby fulfil their national service requirements ?
in our attempts at combating terrorism we are becoming less and less able to balance freedom and security , and the public can feel this .
as the Vice-President of this House responsible for transparency , I have not always found it an easy subject , but I do believe that now we have the chance to do better and to reach out even further to our citizens .
despite this , it seems more helpful to me to withdraw the proposal .
family reunifications involving second , third or fourth wives - which go against the prohibition , customary in Europe , of bigamy - must be brought to an end without delay .
a great deal of money has been spent on repairing the damage .
at least the moderate Arab States have now witnessed the catastrophe that can so easily be provoked by organisations such as Hizbollah , and Lebanon has seen the effect of tolerating a State within a State .
Mr President , amid the tragedy there is one encouraging sign .
viewed in a Green perspective , the Commission ’ s original proposal was completely unacceptable when it came to environmental and social criteria in the case of public procurement .
he has seen what has happened to his friend and main bankroller , Gaddafi ; and just a week ago , on 31 March , the Southern African Development Community , which includes South Africa and all Zimbabwe &apos;s neighbours , at last voiced its grave concern at the resurgence of violence in Zimbabwe .
ten years after the horrific events in Kosovo , we should remind ourselves of the power of the European perspective .
labour MEPs are voting for this report as it backs the reform process , but we do not support any calls to weaken the proposals adopted by Basel .
there is a continuous and gross violation of the delicate system of checks and balances that characterise democracy .
second , the issue of training . Greater consideration must be given to this , particularly by company managers ; furthermore , it would be possible to integrate this training into the procedures currently under discussion with regard to reducing working hours .
today , Mr Prodi again presented his credentials to the forum affirming not only that both he and his team are ready to serve it but also that they can , with their alluring words , deliberately mislead the citizens .
the choice is not between the life or death of one or more people , but between the civilisation of democracy and the barbarity of arbitrary power .
the new general timetable and budgetary plan are to be adopted at the next Council meeting in June , or in October 2010 at the latest .
the Commission fully supports the text which the committee approved by an overwhelming majority on 3 May , and I urge Parliament to do so too .
that is unacceptable .
biofuels offer new sources of income for European industries .
the drugs monitoring centre in Lisbon has been set up and Europol , official this week , is now up and running but has a long way to go .
professionals in the oil industry and market are increasingly raising the issue of the ridiculously low margin requirement for crude oil futures .
we should , therefore , stick to the gentleman &apos;s agreement over a one third to two thirds division of the money available .
this number includes 75 million people who live in areas bordering the Danube .
a short while ago , the Commissioner noted that Member States have been very slow in implementing the directives and regulations .
still I believe that the Commission has taken an extremely important step - and the Commissioner deserves every credit for this - by putting the emphasis on the problem of poverty and coherence between it and other policy areas .
above all , however , the European Union must extend its development aid policy and monitor it more successfully and must know where the funds are going and how they are used .
with such a strategy , we will also discover how to tackle the uncertainty that exists amongst employees in Europe .
I believe that Europe must respect and adjust to the natural advantages those economies have , shifting our own focus to sectors and to products where our own skills and technologies give us the edge .
the repeated references to reproductive rights denote support for generalised abortion .
technology needs reliable guidelines , rules , not inextricable mazes .
it is , as a British Foreign Secretary , Ernest Bevin , used to say , the main purpose of a foreign policy to allow citizens to be able to travel with a minimum of bureaucratic interference and annoyance .
the Rapid Border Intervention Teams are set up in response to a request lodged by one or more Member States .
this increase largely concerns what we call the convergence regions and especially certain countries that experienced particular difficulties in 2009 .
yet , when we know that food and agricultural production increased 2.6 fold in the second half of the 20th century , it becomes clear that it advanced more in 50 years than it did in the 10 000 years before .
it is still not clear who was responsible for the occupation .
Member of the Commission . - As far as the first question is concerned , the cooperation with international institutions - the IMF , World Bank - we are working very closely together with those institutions , for example , for the vulnerability flex .
unlike Mr Marchiani , I do not envisage Russia &apos;s accession to the European Union .
Commissioner Fischler has the floor .
this justifies the growing concern globally of public health organisations .
the committee on this convention has not questioned this interpretation , which is backed by many years of practice , a Senate decision and Supreme Court judgments .
yes to competition , no to its evident or concealed distortion .
that is not a response that we at European Union level can accept .
the European political parties must strive to promote the participation of women in public life , to put more women forward for election , and here in Parliament they should encourage and create fairer and more equal representation .
it would , of course , be incomprehensible if , after so many years of positive steps under the previous regulation , Forest Focus were now to neglect the field of forest fire prevention .
I call on all Member States to become more actively involved and to make proposals .
the Dublin II Regulation , as you will know , is part of the European common asylum system and it determines which Member State is responsible for the examination and determination of an asylum claim .
finally , they are people whose physical and psychological health is seriously compromised .
( FR ) Mr President , because it has never been proved that , employee for employee and hour of work for hour of work , the Manpower solution to providing session auxiliaries was any cheaper , and because Parliament is constantly trying to make savings , we propose to help it by adding , at the end of paragraph 31 , the following sentence : &apos; reject as too expensive the solution of using a temping agency to replace session auxiliaries &apos; .
the increasing pressure put on the independent media shows just how important those media are .
the debate is closed .
the Commission is endeavouring to secure an agreement on these rules , so that all the URBAN programmes can be signed as soon as possible .
( DE ) This report points out once again the grave deficiencies in the Structural and Cohesion Policy .
both the ECOFIN Council and the presidents for the euro area have seen evidence of this in their work .
this is where the Urban Dimension ’ s city policy , among others , could – indeed , must – have an effect .
Mr President , I put a question to the Council too .
specific impact studies based on relevant statistics need to be carried out before putting forward a directive like this .
not today , not tomorrow , but there will be room .
but I also want to use this opportunity to emphasize my belief that we need to work in partnership with industry .
therefore I cannot really help the honourable Member .
it should also be noted that the remarks with which he now stands charged were made in a definite political context . They refer to the agricultural policy of his own country .
I have commented on a number of central issues , although there are a great many other important issues .
specific reports must at once be drafted on each country , particularly Algeria and Tunisia .
as I have already argued on several other occasions , inflexible models of labour law are proven to have failed .
since I was first elected , participation in elections has fallen from 63 % to 46 % most recently .
too often children are the first civilian victims of war and they should not be made the military arm of factions or nations in conflict .
I am referring at this point to adapting agricultural activities to the new conditions : forestation , the management of water resources for agriculture and making polluted land environmentally friendly .
I agree with the suggestion of Chairman Gargani , that the importance of the MEP Statute is an issue that we should address .
the quality of air , manure and the protection of the environment are all areas covered by directives with major consequences and difficult to explain to somebody who can see their building project grind to a complete halt because of abstract European rules . ‘ This is yet another example of Brussels interfering ’ .
I think it behoves us to respond to that , not just because of the presence of the office holders , but most importantly of all because of the responsibility which the voters of the European Union have placed on us as their advocates and their voices .
the Doha round must be the round of the developing countries .
of course , additional proposals could have been included in the framework of the recovery plan .
the way the report has now been drawn up provides good conditions for achieving these goals .
ingredients in cosmetic products are now to be listed in full , including the ingredients of perfumes information which so far has not been available .
I think that the toy industry must really look seriously at a proper toy safety mark that it develops and manages itself so that consumers really have that assurance that , when they come to buy toys this Christmas , they will have safe , good quality toys .
since European economic and monetary union came into being on 1 January 1999 , this policy has been in the hands of the European Central Bank .
I would like to draw attention to something else too .
a change in regime has appeared virtually impossible to date .
the social and political changes that have taken place in Montenegro in recent years are a positive sign not only for the EU , but also for the country &apos;s neighbours .
we need to expand health care and medical services , particularly for older people .
these conditions set by Europe have been met and still we are not able to export .
in particular , we shall indicate that national legislation in this field should respect fundamental rights , and in particular the dignity of people .
I find it absolutely appalling that all of us in Europe are averting our eyes and that we are failing to take action .
 
the responsibility of parents is also mentioned in the General Declaration of Human Rights - parents have a preferential right to choose the type of education for their children .
what is more , the areas surrounding the Mediterranean tourist beaches are also increasingly afflicted by accidents , noise and air pollution , and nature reserves are being sacrificed .
the Commission will , of course , work to keep those standards updated as science updates our knowledge of risks .
this principle does in fact put an intolerable burden on countries located in the South and East of the Union and has the pernicious effect of jeopardising the access to asylum and undermining reception conditions .
the main idea is to double the national threshold for de minimis aid to the sector .
Germany is building a gas pipeline along the floor of the Baltic Sea in order to avoid Poland , yet Russia has cut energy supplies to Lithuania , the Czech Republic and other EU countries on more than one occasion .
what must we not do ?
I believe that the European Network and Information Security Agency &apos;s mandate is needed to enable the European Union , Member States and stakeholders to develop a level of preparation and the capacity to prevent and detect network and data security problems , and to respond to them more effectively .
Mr President , I would like to thank Mrs Miguélez and everyone who has spoken in this debate .
this situation will prove beneficial for those operations that would otherwise be too risky for international investors , which will be of benefit not only to developing countries , but also to small and medium-sized businesses in our own countries .
the future strategy devised by the Commission must propose framework programmes adapted to the nomadic lifestyle of some of the Roma community , which will be developed and implemented in a similar manner in all Member States .
Mr Peres told us yesterday that he supported a flourishing and modern Palestinian Authority .
the Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control , Mr Bösch , frequently makes very critical remarks about the agencies - but not in committee .
I would like to highlight what I believe to be the most relevant of the comments received .
not everyone accepts that we need to develop further that system of guarantees .
this is the second time the plenary sitting of the European Parliament has considered the Commission ’ s 2006 work programme , and I hope that both sides will become a bit wiser as a result of this procedure .
3 . There is recognition of the importance of forests for rural development and the need to remove obstacles to funding for forestry and biodiversity .
I am pleased that this case has now been supplemented with a proposal for a defensive mechanism .
finally , allow me to thank those who tabled amendments to the report . As I mentioned , I generally tried to incorporate them , except in two cases : when the amendments did not conform to the vision of European integration that I support , or when they introduced points , albeit legitimate ones , regarding competitiveness , which I felt did not belong in this report .
by accepting this challenge to create cohesion within its borders Germany is also taking on a European responsibility .
Madam President , the Council &apos;s aim to weaken the status of Parliament as a budgetary authority in conjunction with the updating of the Financial Regulation has overshadowed discussion of the additional budget .
Mr President , on a point of order I just want to ask you whether it is customary when the spokesman for a political group fails to turn up for the debate that the spokesman can then be inserted later .
reducing what is , at times , an unproductive burden of bureaucracy is an objective that we must all work towards .
while the summit did not result in any significant decisions , it certainly provided a valuable opportunity for the heads of state or government to discuss the state of progress of the negotiations in the Intergovernmental Conference .
and you wonder why the EU is held in such contempt !
in order to combat the current crisis , we give up nearly new cars to buy other brand new ones , wasting considerable material resources in the process .
its main priority will be to reform the international financial system .
it claimed the lives of millions of people and led to the annihilation of the Jews , as well as plunging Europe into the depths of savagery , economic devastation and moral decay .
in reality , limit values would have to be accompanied either by exemptions for certain areas or by provisions allowing Member States to apply for derogations in cases where the limit values cannot be met .
Mr Bayona &apos;s report reveals this as well .
I ask not only you , Mr President , but also the President of the European Commission , to ensure that we pay more attention to the suggestions they make to us .
Madam President , the conflict in Abkhazia in the Caucasus has again flared up .
but there is still more to do .
the next item is the report by Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra , on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation ( EC ) No 539 / 2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement - C7-0162 / 2010 - .
 
the degree of protection we have now achieved with this directive is not perfect , of course , but is an initial step in the right direction .
given the current disruption in the financial markets , I am sorry that the European Council , a high-level political body in the Union , did not have the strength , wisdom or clarity of thought to propose a policy that might help to regulate the financial markets , at the very least within Europe , such as the establishment of European regulatory bodies in the key sectors of the internal market ( energy , postal services , telecommunications , auditing , banking , insurance , etc . ) .
indeed , for over three years , 350 Commission officials and over 700 people in the Commission delegations have been patiently weaving the fabric of this silent tapestry .
where , then , is Europe in all this ?
I should like to finish by saying a few words on the way forward .
the Commission then had the choice of setting the European standard at the maximum quality level and extending the ban to all Member States but , under pressure from multinational companies wishing to reduce their production costs , in April 1996 the Commission proposed a directive authorising the addition of a minimum level of vegetable fats .
such schemes may provide an important demand stimulus for the automotive industry at Community level and should also ensure a level playing field within the internal market .
during the last few days we have seen Serbs murdered by Kosovar Albanian Mafia-type groups , also with impunity .
but I find it highly ironic , and I am sure the timing is not coincidental , that on the very day that we are debating blood alcohol , drink driving , road safety , the day before this Parliament is to vote on drink driving , the Commissioner has already made her mind up .
for this reason the prosecution those responsible is a basic requirement for the stability of a new democracy .
this is why the Stockholm and Lisbon European Councils made the commitment not to reduce all aid , but aid in the sense of Article 87 , in other words aid that creates unfair competition .
voluntarily , we have taken it upon ourselves to improve our environmental performance on a day-to-day basis .
the Schengen states will have to be prepared for the fact that in future all states joining the EU will automatically become members of the Schengen cooperation under the EU umbrella .
it is somewhat early , therefore , to be specific about the contents and structure of the reports at this stage .
I address this to President Santer and to the Irish Prime Minister .
what I can tell you is that the Commission has been doing everything in its power to suggest greater ambition .
Mr President , just like Commissioner van den Broek , one must naturally be relieved at the return of the UN weapons inspectors and by the fact that Iraq has accepted , in order to avoid further conflict with the USA .
subject : Consequences of the use of depleted uranium bombs in Kosovo Intense concern has been caused in Europe by revelations concerning the development of leukaemia among members of the international forces who served in Bosnia and Kosovo , which has been attributed to the use of depleted uranium bombs .
it will enable us to set harmonised maximum residue levels in the EU for all pesticides and all agricultural products in one piece of legislation directly applicable to all EU citizens .
this certainly was not the case .
on the other hand , there is the question of energy - both the Nabucco pipeline and the Odessa-Brody-Gdańsk pipeline have been mentioned - and , in general , energy security .
think how dependent the individual employees are on their companies when they are to agree upon wages and working time .
the Charter states that the rights of elderly people are to be respected by Europe , and that is why pensioners and elderly people throughout Europe are waiting impatiently for the Charter to become the Constitution of the European Union .
however , the topic of this report is not the UCITS revision , which is forthcoming and which we welcome .
what is wanted – and this message will be heard from politicians in the forthcoming election campaign too – is a set of clear and binding targets for local and regional authorities , targets designed solely to improve the quality of people ’ s lives .
the result is , therefore , a result that is due to everyone , but I too would like to express my satisfaction that you , Commissioner de Palacio , focused on this objective with great tenacity , together with the rapporteur , the shadow rapporteur and also ourselves as members of the committee .
we believe that the duplication of decision-making bodies and the development of a military staff separate from NATO will inevitably exacerbate policy differences between allies , to the detriment of the transatlantic relationship and the long-term security of our people .
Turkey can have an extended trade agreement .
furthermore , many international issues will demand our attention .
it makes you stop and wonder .
we tried very hard to lay down clear lines of responsibility .
why is the Council not prepared to introduce one ?
publicising the intention to draw up the black list I described may well save the lives of many people and protect them against repression .
I am sure that my group and I shall be able to cooperate constructively with him as our new President .
the energy balance-sheet of every European Union Member State is different , but we are all concerned by one and the same question - the security of energy supply .
Iranian men and women are tortured daily in these prisons , too .
in terms of administrative law it has now been possible to get some protective measures off the ground but , as always , it will take a long time to create a legal framework to protect the Community budget under criminal law , although the need for action is urgent as surveys have shown that 70 % of Europe &apos;s taxpayers are much more critical of the fraudulent and improper use of tax money than tax evasion as such .
Madam President , Commissioner , I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on the production of this report .
what is more , it is bureaucratic and leads to long delays .
our ambition , by creating a single currency of the countries of Europe today , is to create greater employment and prosperity for the peoples of Europe tomorrow .
I answered , ‘ A small part of Turkey is in Europe , and a large part of Turkey is in Asia . ’ ‘ Then you must say no to Turkey joining the European Union , ’ he remarked , and then continued , ‘ but if Turkey does join the European Union , will it at last put an end to Islamic terrorism ? ’
the Irish economy has been growing at the remarkable rate of 6 % on average over the last 10 years .
having said that , the proof that I am in total agreement with you is that I am leaving to tour the area again tomorrow , and to take stock of the situation on the ground .
this additional supporting leg also has the merit of not entailing any further surplus production , but actually creates a means of promoting our market policies by replacing surplus production with alternative crops which may also serve as a substitute for mineral oil , for example .
we must also urgently review our neighbourhood policy with third countries and make the inclusion of human rights clauses an essential condition of all our trade agreements .
Mr Van Rompuy , the automatic nature of the sanctions during the preventive phase was sacrificed in Deauville .
how can you know it will come ?
I would just ask the Commission - as my colleague Kader Arif has already done - to be very careful in evaluating each individual case .
we know that every minute of every day a child is born with HIV ; we know that 2.3 million children are living in our world with HIV ; that only one in 10 who needs anti-retroviral treatment receives it ; in the absence of treatment we know that an estimated one third of infants die in their first year and half die by their second birthday ; we know that 15.2 million children under the age of 18 have lost one or both parents to AIDS ; and we know that by 2010 , that magical year , more than 20 million children will have been orphaned by AIDS .
this may seem self-evident but , in fact , it is not for everyone .
we must endeavour to explore further possibilities for the future , Commissioner , for the 2004 budget , if possible .
as the EU and Canada are committed to build a low-carbon global economy that is safe and sustainable , also to invest in clean energy technologies and become the leaders in green job creation in order the capacity to adapt to the impacts of climate change would be strengthened .
to this end , I endorse the Commission &apos;s approach , which is based on harmonisation , on the principle of mutual recognition of the country of origin , on a general prohibition on unfair commercial practices , on the identifying of specific criteria and examples and on the fact that the scope of application is limited to a framework directive based on business-consumer relations .
as the Agency &apos;s competences are limited , I believe that its activities will complement rather than compete with those of the Council of Europe .
we take them for granted , but it appears that in our ultra-civilised Europe they are not always observed .
I would like to associate myself expressly with this judgement , and I do not understand why the socialist party is apparently split on this question , because the former President and present Vice-Chairman , Mr Hänsch , said yesterday in an interview that the European Conference could be dissolved , and that it should be made clear to Turkey once and for all that it cannot join .
it is fair to say that many dismissed any chance that this negotiation could make much progress , but the presidency has proved them wrong .
however , safety remains the most important ingredient in our food .
even now EU resources are being used for military operations , but not for a common EU defence force .
it may also be used , for example , for cooling , water purification and air conditioning .
I welcome your broad support .
the estimates are that somewhere between half a million and 720 000 people will be infected before this wave of epidemics is over .
in practice , Sudan has been in a state of war ever since it gained independence .
in order to make it even more difficult for the inexperienced new Member States to obtain funding , the report rules out a more flexible application of the n + 2 rule for the Structural Funds , and provides no solution to the problem of VAT and EU cofinanced projects .
I would therefore like to ask whether it would be possible for Parliament to have a plaque made .
this requires action to address the underlying causes , including an examination of the electoral process itself .
that is one view of things , and obviously we welcome it when obstacles in the way of the extradition process between EU states are removed .
it is worth pointing out why they considered these initiatives to be misguided , and this is because , for example , they think it would be a mistake to adopt amendments to the Europol Convention &apos; prior to the ratification of the European Constitution &apos; !
this was not addressed to Mrs Lalumière , and so must be deleted from the Verbatim Report of Proceedings .
we should not just think about ourselves .
I do hope that this Parliament , which has that responsibility , will undertake that in the course of the next 12 months .
obviously these statistics cannot express the human suffering , and merely conceal the pain and tears .
I should like to extend my thanks and congratulations to Mr Vatanen for his excellent report .
the Community ’ s contribution towards the forestry strategy and support for forestry will amount to between something like 50 % and 55 % , with upper limits clearly set out in the annex to the regulation .
I am not , of course , going to become embroiled in a war of figures , as there are quite a few other people who are ready to do so .
Mr President , the rapporteur and Mrs Malone quite rightly drew attention to the issue of labour and human rights .
Madam President , for us in Greece , the textile sector is particularly important , both for our industry and for the economy as a whole .
nor does high-tech equipment with all mod-cons guarantee the animals &apos; welfare during transportation , if the use of the vehicle and the actions of the driver are inappropriate .
Mr President , although it is late , we are discussing a subject which , as was said a few moments ago , is extremely important .
as a result of the solution that has been accepted , it will be easier to compare offers and real energy usage and this will encourage consumers to change suppliers if they are dissatisfied with the service offered .
with regard to Belarus &apos;s participation in the bilateral strand of the Eastern Partnership , the text of the Commission &apos;s proposal is unequivocal : the development of bilateral relations between the European Union and Belarus is , and will remain , dependent on the development of the political situation in the country .
this is a sector for multiple targeting as it has significant benefits in terms both of energy savings and climate protection , while at the same time creating employment and contributing to the development of technological innovation .
the Kyoto commitments must be fulfilled .
nor do we consider it appropriate for every disabled insured person to be entitled to the costs of travel and stay for an accompanying person .
secondly , I should also like to expressly draw your attention to the role of information technologies in modern theatre .
we in Parliament must , therefore , do everything we can to make the International Year of Chemistry a success because , as Marie Curie said , &apos; now is the time to understand more , so that we may fear less &apos; .
the association agreements are also an important part of the Barcelona Process .
consequently , in order to complete the internal market , reforms of the economic side , especially those aspects relating to the market liberalisation , are all the more pressing .
I would make the following suggestion . It is fundamental in the allocation of structural funds or other major programmes that the amount of money available for the physically disabled should be identified .
however , it is clear from his own report that BNFL cannot be trusted .
nevertheless , I believe that this report represents important progress . In the past , it was often the case that only the French or those on the left-wing who were in favour of strong state control spoke up in support of industrial policy .
Eurodac will be a significant tool for ensuring that the Dublin Convention functions efficiently .
Madam President , every year in Greece and in other Mediterranean countries of the Community enormous areas of forests are burned .
that would be the right thing to do .
why this strict ban ?
so I am pleased to hear about the expert teams , but the Commission should not underestimate how many of them will be needed in many parts of the Union .
( Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137 , Paragraph 1 of the Rules of Procedure )
the Commission has noted that the Council has supported the continuation of the actions currently carried out under the existing Fiscalis programme .
establishing partial decoupling in the work of the committee would allow producers to receive a fixed sum of basic aid per farm or per hectare , calculated on past figures but restricted to a maximum figure of EUR 10 000 .
we still have a long list of proposals .
once again , we are facing a situation in which there is the risk of closure of a European car plant .
at the G8 Summit held in July 2000 in Okinawa , the rich industrialised G8 countries pledged substantial funds to fight communicable diseases and help the sick in poor countries .
I hope that in future , Parliament will always give its attention to cases whenever there is violence against any religious group , and not just concentrate on the persecution of Christians .
we must re-design it in a way that will make it more socially just .
the latter would involve all those who play a part in the management and monitoring of Community funds , and would be used to start off a comprehensive discussion enabling us to envisage the reforms needed to obtain a positive statement of assurance as soon as possible .
consequently I cannot accept the amendment of Mrs Auroi either .
I also request the European Commission to verify whether the Member States comply with the obligations they undertook via treaties , regarding discrimination based on nationality .
the problem is serious and requires specific assistance from the government , local authorities and social organisations , and support for the poorest regions of the EU in particular .
of how many incidents of hostility is the outside world unaware ?
in spite of all the work that has been done , the whole area of industrial fishing remains , certainly to me , a little bit mysterious .
the Commission does all it can to use outstanding appropriations for other requirements by transferring appropriations and , where it can , by proposing supplementary or amending budgets , as it has in the past .
even before this , we need to implement policies to support SMEs , the driving force and economic heart of Europe , above all , by promoting fiscal packages and incentives that allow easier access to credit .
first of all , I deplore the fact that the retroactivity of the measures has not been explicitly worded and I welcome the fact that many of Parliament &apos; s amendments forcefully emphasise the importance of this point for all types of farming , as we must think of the thousands of farmers who are waiting for these measures .
now , there is just Ireland to go , you may say , and then we will have a treaty that will also provide more opportunities for my Committee on Development to make better policy .
I must pay tribute to our industries because , through these research programmes , the industries have developed a whole series of mechanisms , services and products which help older people to stay longer in their own homes .
they can take photographs of ships and if they are in the wrong area they can be taken to task and the fishermen can be fined in the courts .
although the site will start off in Dutch , the institute does not rule out the introduction of an English version , thus allowing non-Dutch-speakers to have their sites tested too .
I would also like to thank the Declaration Office and my staff , whose hard work made our job that much easier .
this poor organisation of the debate encourages me to make a second comment .
I have some reservations regarding on-board diagnostics and in-service testing .
the other central theme of Parliament &apos;s amendments is the incorporation of new priorities and new issues .
thank you , Mr Eisma .
we are very grateful in this respect for the constructive and persistent role played by the European Parliament , and I am looking forward to hearing your views in this debate .
the gamble has almost paid off , and I warmly congratulate our Commissioner , Mr Potočnik , and our rapporteur , Mr Buzek .
this Parliament has submitted proposals on the taxation of financial transactions and on Eurobonds , but you refuse to consider them .
it is vital to keep to the priority of tackling the employment problem .
I feel it is important to find out about this , especially in view of the possibility currently being mooted of introducing cofinancing for income support as well .
Mr President , we all know that , politically , the European Commission is accountable to the European Parliament .
the moderate opponent Manuel Cuesta Morua has been beaten up by a collection of regime supporters and has been at the receiving end of extreme racist abuse .
at the Madrid Summit , both regions wish to take a further step , in not only a quantitative but also a qualitative sense , which would consist of a better structuring of political dialogue and a broader range of issues for discussion , which would also cover those not relating to regional problems .
Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz recognised this clearly .
that decision amounted to a premeditated crime against the entire nation .
we have a programme which runs until 2006 , with a review in 2002 .
being a lawyer , I went and looked up the relevant article .
we need to reflect .
needless to say , harmonisation must also be examined at global level .
. Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , you are probably familiar with the traditional English appellations ‘ ruby ’ , ‘ vintage ’ , ‘ tawny ’ and ‘ late bottled ’ , which , at Community level , are protected terms when applied to fortified quality wines produced in Portugal .
finally , I would once again like to emphasise and ensure that Article 9 , or the &apos; social clause &apos; , permeates all our policy decisions , because that really will lead to cohesion in the EU .
this mistaken standpoint can only lead to erroneous consequences !
Mr President , on a point of order , you said that the Conference of Presidents had decided this under the Rules of Procedure .
the negotiations currently under way for the definition of standards for more humane traps are going well and represent a first step towards an international agreement founded on scientific knowledge and the concern better to protect animals .
it can also be observed that a number of measures introduced under royal rule are contrary to the guarantees of freedom of expression and association in the 1990 Constitution , pointing towards a return to the pre-1990 Panchayat system of governance .
there are other problems too , such as Cyprus .
Madam President , first of all I would like to say to Mrs Guy-Quint that I agree with her entirely .
he should be grateful that we see our Union flag up at all .
the rest follows : the primacy of collective regulation over individual exceptions ; the fact that there are European areas of responsibility that respect national prerogatives in the social field and that there is a Community dimension , governed by subsidiarity , of specific regulatory competence , to guarantee minimum standards , which give a meaning to the European dimension , not reducing it to mere squeezing onto the market ; the fight against the underground labour market ; and , finally , the rejection of the logic of trade .
at the same time , VAT on children &apos;s goods in the European Union is charged at the basic rate , in other words , at the highest possible rate .
Mr President , Mrs Bonino , I should like to ask you a question , though admittedly you have answered most of it already : what is the situation in the countries of central and eastern Europe , particularly in Poland , where conditions are still pretty dreadful ?
Madam President , the report by the Committee on Legal Affairs is right only in so far as there are one or two faults to be found with the work of the Molitor Group , but certainly not as many as the report makes it appear .
secondly , and whether we like it or not , it is inevitable that Kosovo will come to enjoy a certain form of independence , although the precise definition of it is open to debate .
the EU bubble , joint fulfilment of commitments within the EU , was subject to an unusually aggressive attack by the Japanese hosts and seconded by our US colleagues .
after all , the Council has not yet given 100 % confirmation in respect of whether external costs will be included in future pricing .
religious tolerance needs to be promoted both by those that hold political power and at grassroots level .
( PT ) Mr President , Commissioner , the European Parliament will soon be called on to reach a decision on the revision of the Programme of Options Specifically Relating to Remoteness and Insularity ( POSEI ) , which was created to respond to the remoteness and insularity of the European Union &apos;s outermost regions .
I am going to comment on the economic context , also with reference to many of this morning ’ s interventions .
moreover , the European Union , which has already lost the battle of Hollywood , is in danger of losing the battle of Silicon Valley if our various Member States do not realise the urgency of regaining technological control by putting in place a common multimedia policy .
if I have understood correctly , you asked if we shall convene an extraordinary Foreign Affairs Council in the wake of developments in Serbia .
that is the number one energy of the future .
on 1 June 2005 , the local British presidency in Tashkent approached the Uzbek Foreign Minister , Mr Ganiev , asking him to request the Uzbek authorities to reconsider their rejection of an independent international inquiry and to draw his attention to the country ’ s international obligations .
we are in a difficult situation and we need to get out of it .
the EEVs provide for a fuel and technology-neutral concept based on the best available technology which will allow Member States or local authorities to encourage the use of the vehicles which qualify as EEVs through tax incentives .
this demonstrates that the approach does not focus solely and exclusively on the internal market , but that the provision of adequate health services is also fundamental .
I believe that the proposed directive represents a departure from the hitherto accepted model for European competition policy , which was about ensuring workable competition , and according to which regulatory interventions in a market or in individual market segments can be justified only if structural market conditions or attempts by participants in the market to restrict competition are interfering with economic efficiency .
first of all , I welcome the fact that the preamble to the regulation expressly acknowledges the need to undertake an evaluation of issues concerning phosphate content and the biodegradability of detergents and establishes the Commission &apos;s duty to inform Parliament and the Council , within three years , of the results of this evaluation .
we know from our experiences in Slovenia that if a young farmer takes over a farm , he will usually also modernise it and continue to farm successfully .
the public record now shows my actual voting intention .
if this proposal means that a system of financial aid needs to be set up , at the European level , to support Member States which are experiencing serious difficulties with regard to the control of their external borders , we are in agreement .
it is in stark contrast to the positions of extremists of both sorts . We trust our position will enable us to facilitate agreement on all aspects of the agricultural negotiations .
in some States , the Labour Code stipulates that every illegal contract must be re-classed as a full-time , permanent contract .
( ES ) Madam President , thank you very much to the Commissioner for being here .
as Parliament &apos;s rapporteur on corporate social responsibility I wanted to make a contribution to this debate by putting the debate on Ecolabelling and EMAS , in terms of reporting by companies , into the wider context of what we are trying to do on corporate responsibility and accountability , and in particular to address the issue of whether voluntary schemes , as against statutory schemes , are the right way forward and whether we should have Europe-focused schemes or a global approach .
it goes without saying that the restrictions imposed on the International Committee of the Red Cross , as you rightly said , are intolerable : there are few signs that the government is undertaking to remedy the matter .
those people who at the moment have been asking for calm and for no retaliatory action will not be listened to .
I should like to add that any future enlargement must be preceded by fundamental reform of the financial perspectives , and by an appropriate increase in the Union &apos;s budget .
and I call upon you , Mr. Commissioner , and you all , members , to come visit Bulgaria in order to see the kind of solidarity that Emel Etem has for her own constituency , that of the MRL to its own constituency , to the Muslim Bulgarians , who have been living in temporary shelter , in caravans not fit for living in , while the money from the European Solidarity Fund has sunk away somewhere in the depths of the ministry run by the MRL .
the spectrum is very wide .
I think that the government will have to implement the roadmap which it presented on 3 May .
lastly , I call for more condemnation by Muslim leaders of terrorism and the rejection of extremism within their communities .
no one is yet in a position to say which way the ruling would fall in a case before the World Trade Organisation because no case has yet been decided on the basis of the protection of animals and moral considerations .
the fifth point I wish to emphasize is that in order to tackle a medical complaint a proper diagnosis must be carried out .
is that serious ?
let us be honest : 99 % of asylum seekers are , in fact , not asylum seekers at all , but economic fortune seekers abusing our asylum laws .
that approach would devalue Parliament and every Member of Parliament .
let us recall that we are approaching a time when we must jointly propose to other regions of the world a change to the regulations and principles of functioning in the world economy and in global trade .
no , Mr President , we want to do what is possible within the present legal framework , but we cannot go any further than this , because the better choice is the enemy of the right choice .
the name of the Governor of Virginia has been missed off the list of recipients of the resolution . Please would you ensure that the Governor of Virginia &apos;s name is inserted at the end of the text of our resolution , for our appeal is addressed precisely to him .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I think it would have been extremely hypocritical if the European Parliament had not debated this issue today , that is , if we had not debated the fact that homophobic public displays and statements have increased in Europe in recent years .
Mr President , if we are to alleviate poverty in the world , we have to increase global trade .
today , when we in Europe speak about globalisation , many people think , above all , of the growing , emerging economic powers in Asia .
secondly , unfortunately in quite a few Member States , including my home country , those holding extremist positions are increasingly gaining ground .
last November the European Commission issued a communication on strengthening the southern maritime borders and I call on the Commission to press on with the initiatives listed in this communication .
we need to give stimulus to private initiatives , as is the case with Galileo , but we need to take note that the objective of doubling the space budget in ten years will only go part way towards bridging the gap with the United States .
regarding the costs , I would like a letter from Mr Priestley outlining the costs .
the old behaviour patterns resurfaced .
we cannot deny that Europe does not have any effective response to this new phenomenon , which is a consequence of globalisation .
these are special structures , the like of which is not found anywhere else in Europe .
that will help further guarantee the reconstruction work .
Europe has done this in the past and we must be able to continue to do this .
however , we should not forget that discontinuation of the operation of an institute of national and European strategic importance , such as the Cantacuzino Institute , entails a high potential hazard .
the self-employed are included as a matter of principle and can only be excluded if two things happen : first , if the Commission proposes such an exclusion ; and secondly , if we , as co-legislator here in Parliament , agree with such an exclusion .
the fundamental problems are employment , the situation of our small and medium-sized enterprises , and the sustainability of our public services and social welfare systems .
now it is time for action on the part of the Community , and above all on the part of the Member States .
it is a fact that the present regulation provides protection in the social security sector for persons moving for any reason – personal or professional – from one Member State to another .
. throughout history governments and central banks have adopted different and radical measures .
we have a challenging agenda in front of us .
Mr President , I do not want to debate this either , but I have to clarify that what Mr Posselt said is wrong .
we cannot have any transitional presidencies .
I was motivated to make this call by the disturbing news that has emerged from yesterday &apos;s talks between the transport ministers of the EU-25 .
I hope that we will have an opportunity to discuss this in more detail in the coming weeks .
I and my British Conservative colleagues are voting for this report but with one important proviso .
in this connection , then , we hopefully awoke to the fact that these problems of transit are serious and stability is also needed in transit countries , and not just in Russia , when it comes to gas supplies .
in the first place , there are serious problems about the system in terms of conservation of resources .
so I appreciate what has been done here today and I think that , from today on , we should also move on to dealing with the financial terrorists of the rating agencies and the speculators who are playing havoc with people &apos;s lives and trying to bring down sovereign governments .
however , we do feel that the Barcelona Summit should be treated as an opportunity to make substantial progress in incorporating environmental issues into the European Union &apos; s policy package and , to this end , it is vital that we assess and review all the sectoral strategies .
that is my first plea .
Haiti and its people need fire-fighters , doctors , hospitals and basic necessities .
we have mentioned a single standard .
the history of Europe as a whole , give or take a century , is full of different kinds of works which have survived the passage of time because of their artistic value .
I recall that the Nice Council before Christmas set out a number of guidelines for new social policy measures .
that is very good , and I call on the Irish Government to immediately apply for funding on their behalf .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I am grateful to Mrs Martens , especially for the way in which we were able to work together in committee , for her attentiveness and also for the divergences that emerged , the differences between us ; but I think the outcome , apart from a few points , is a very significant one .
of course , the Commission &apos;s services responsible for INTERREG and PHARE CBC have already worked together to bring the PHARE CBC regulations and procedures as close as possible to those of the structural funds , and we are taking steps to encourage even greater harmonization and simplification of the procedures .
( the President cut off the speaker )
I think that the negotiating text on the table today shows that , if we conclude this round , it would indeed deliver on development .
the definition of less ambitious and realistic objectives must relate solely to the Hong Kong conference and not to the Doha round overall .
in the European Union , the State now seeks to exist in its own right and have the people answer to it .
Madam President , I am last but not least and I hope I shall not take three minutes .
does he believe the very essence of being a country - having a domestic government , an independent economy and national borders - is inherently wrong ?
thirdly , the policy group entitled &apos; education and citizenship &apos; has also become green .
the study stresses the importance of protecting the wetlands as part of a global water policy .
this understanding provides for an elimination of EEC semiconductor duties more expeditiously than under the general rule set out within the ITA , but also in return for that , the elimination in one step of certain US duties of interest to the European Community .
that was the reason why we in the Committee on Regional Development , immediately after the reform of the Structural Fund and for the umpteenth time , asked the question how we were to assess Europe &apos;s poorest regions in future .
subject : Korea FTA
it was , I think , Milton Friedman who observed that there are two kinds of money in the world : there is your money and there is my money .
as Christian Democrats , we cannot consent to withdrawing from the codecision procedure at the expense of our road haulage companies and at the expense of the environment .
the Commission will work out how to clarify it .
therefore , by making progress in these areas , the European Union will be able to better justify its existence and thus increase its legitimacy as far as public opinion and citizens are concerned .
unfortunately the rapporteur has chosen to adopt very few of these broad and elevated proposals .
this is not democratic and we will fight it .
we are now working hard to reach this target .
I thus agree with the rapporteur that the flow of information between Parliament , the Council and the Commission must be improved upon .
the real criticism you might make , which would hit home , is that we are passive in this type of situation .
realistically , we might foresee the need , even in the future , for between US $ 50 billion and 200 bn , i.e. only one eighth or , at most , one half of what is at the Bank &apos;s disposal .
the vote will take place on Thursday 4 September .
my firm conviction is that united Europeans could be more than a match for these trials .
yet this is what may well happen .
a criterion based on unambiguously democratic principles would have been better than a mediocre , mean-spirited criterion that was unable to look beyond the scarcity of funding .
four amendments have been voted which are in addition to what the committee voted .
there will still be the technical textile sector , high-tech with nanotechnology , the beginnings of which we already have .
Mr President , first of all I should like to thank my colleague Mrs Peijs for her very hard work in trying to reach suitable compromises on such a controversial and difficult report .
because the fact that according to today &apos;s Frankfurter Allgemeine , only the US Secretary of State expressly criticised Mr Mugabe &apos;s reign of terror in the plenary assembly at Johannesburg hurt me personally a great deal .
under this system , private processing companies are involved in the actual checking work , while they in turn are subject to checks by the appropriate authorities , so that the checking work stipulated is also monitored .
regional and local cultures are gradually dying , and numerous forms of their expression , and their disciplines and creative skills are disappearing .
I welcome the new regulation which is primarily designed to strengthen and improve social legislation for drivers engaged in road transport activities .
of course , we cannot claim that the report covers all aspects of the issue of detergents .
I have taken careful note of the amendments put forward by Mr Secchi and , in particular , Amendments Nos 1 and 2 stressing the importance of the directive for SMEs and the advisability of extending the scope of the directive to non-associated companies in the future .
now , at the eleventh hour when things are getting serious , a majority of you have chosen not to care about these objectives and , instead , to leap into the German chemicals industry &apos;s unsafe embrace .
recently it has become even harder - last year Lithuanian pensioners &apos; monthly pension was reduced by 5 % .
this would also give the local economies a very badly needed boost .
why does the Code of Canon Law govern the rights of citizens who are not Catholics ?
since the start of the year , at least 16 journalists have been arrested , which places Iran amongst the worst countries in the world in terms of restrictions imposed on the freedom of the press .
to conclude , I would quite candidly ask you how long it is going to take and how many meetings are going to be necessary before the 25 …
the shipbuilding industry employs about 130 000 people in the EU .
indeed , the ICCAT Member States decided to target overcapacity of their fishing fleet in order to halve it by 2011 .
a lot of jobs are at stake : there are about 70 , 000 jobs in the components and motor manufacturing industry in Coventry and the West Midlands alone . So we are talking about something of economic importance in this directive .
the work of the Committee and Parliament needs to be firmly anchored to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
Mrs Levai is therefore right to challenge the Commission option , which relies more on an inadequate consultation process .
needless to say , this is not about whether or not the Bush diplomacy has scored a victory .
this would effectively guarantee genuine freedom of movement of people and goods within the European territory and would pave the way for strategic interconnection with the Mediterranean and Eastern European countries .
I believe that this work is also highly valuable because it preserves in full the content of the codified acts ; all it does is bring them together .
the problems have been recognised for a long time , but progress on solving them has been slow .
the development of European defence industries should not be motivated by the desire &quot; to compete with US industry &quot; but by the need to provide our armed forces with the best possible equipment and to meet national security and industrial requirements .
the Council text has been amended so that some articles which may have breached rules of subsidiarity ( those that are concerned with the regulation of investigations and prosecutions rather than with the exchange of information ) , in fact are now , in my view , in line with this principle .
the President of the European Council said that patriotism leads to war .
he has promised to allocate all of the budget surplus to fiscal consolidation and debt reduction .
we are all aware of the Commission &apos;s recent commitment to draw up a Green Paper in the near future in order to stimulate a discussion on this issue .
( applause )
the draft report divides these evaluations into four sections . The first section takes the view that the impact assessments used by the European institutions should comply with certain principles and should be completely independent and transparent .
however , if this is where we are at now , then it is because , back in 2004 , they did not have the courage to give a truly European impetus to the railways .
that is all I am willing to say to you .
nevertheless , the limits given in the budget cannot be exceeded .
I am glad to see the Brussels Summit demonstrate that Europe is more capable of learning that lesson than the British Conservative Party .
the report by the Committee on Transport has significantly amended all sections of the Commission &apos;s proposal .
as the removal of technical barriers to trade in goods comes within the exclusive competence of the Union , the Agreement can be concluded by means of a Council Decision .
we would underline that all these initiatives are not in the context of an old fashioned kind of anti-Americanism , but are based on the recognition that all good-willed people need each other .
can we deliver ?
that is why we were elected .
hence my conclusion that the answer to the removal of the arms embargo is ‘ no ’ .
I use this as just one example of why we need to affirm our commitment to services of public and general interest , but also as an example of why we must not treat the frequencies currently used by broadcasting as somehow untouchable .
if the Council does not offer enough in the way of counterweight against this weakening measure , the Commission will have no choice but to withdraw the proposal .
we fully support the rapporteur and we also support his proposal .
one further point I would like to make is the interest of the third countries in the Community approach to the treatment of personal data and the protection of private life .
I believe that the Commission would indeed have been Tartuffe had it not drawn conclusions from these debates that have been held over the years and I believe that we are drawing the conclusions in a very clear manner .
I say that , and let there be no mistake about this , because it is not just the United States and its population that has been targeted , but democracy itself . Democracy and its values of liberty , tolerance and humanity , which are the exact opposite of blind and suicidal terrorism .
for these reasons , we should deal with this issue very carefully and with a deep awareness of our responsibilities .
I will now pass to other issues raised .
this is an issue which affects us in the Commission and Parliament , but also the national governments .
the solution , obviously , is to give the Court of Auditors jurisdictional power and adequate human and material resources to take on this role .
it is not our role to foster the slow-down our partners take refuge in , or to foster divisions .
Anti-Zionism , and everyone knows it , in many respects , is the contemporary form of anti-Semitism .
. Mr President , Mrs Gál ’ s report enables us to establish the European Parliament ’ s priorities regarding the extension of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia ’ s remit to convert it into a Fundamental Rights Agency .
one point I would like to make is this .
I therefore voted in favour .
Mr President , the Commission document on health and safety at work is a good document .
that is ridiculous for a citizen of the European Union in an aspiring Member State .
I attach great historic significance to the creation and functioning of the Visegrad grouping whose aim is to encourage close cohesion of an mutually beneficial cooperation within the central European region as the basis for its future integration into economic , political and security structures .
I am voting in favour of the proposal because EEA funds will be made available to the 12 most recent Member States , along with Portugal , as well as Greece and Spain , and the areas to be funded include the environment , especially climate change and renewable energy , civil society and the protection of cultural heritage .
the International Monetary Fund has once again pointed out that it is the large states , Germany , France and Italy , that act as bottlenecks on the continent and are thus responsible for the fact that the next boom will probably pass Europe by .
clearly , the provisions on animal experimentation must be amended , but European research must not , however , suffer negative consequences from this new legislation .
the Pelttari report would have been a chance to send a very clear signal to the parliamentary assembly and to the Council of Europe , saying that this draft convention must be rejected .
the President of the International Olympic Committee has called a meeting in Lausanne on 3 and 4 February to discuss doping . In my view , the European Union should be adequately briefed for the meeting .
thirteen million children die every year from preventable disease and 200 million children are undernourished .
the fact that we cannot slow down the work towards setting up SIS II - the new generation of the SIS system - is apparent to everyone .
on our success will hang the future of the European social model too .
as far as sustainability impact assessments are concerned , they have already been conducted on the first batch of NAMA sectors in 2002 / 2003 , i.e. textiles and clothing , pharmaceuticals and non-ferrous metals .
this will cause a minimum delay of three months in decisions and the two people responsible for administering the programmes will have to generate 70 , 000 extra pages of paperwork a year - 70 , 000 - this is madness !
however , this must not result in the Commission being given such far-reaching powers that the Member States can no longer select their own projects and partners , for example .
we hope that in future , the control mechanisms will remain in place in the new countries too .
I find it absolutely absurd that we are not able to work for more than two hours at a time .
in other words , success will depend on a number of factors , but above all on a distinct financial effort .
the objective is to ensure that basic freedom of movement is upheld for both workers and services , and that the social legislation aimed at protecting employees is complied with .
and if we are saying other things , that is simply because we are treating the Stability Pact as done for .
I hope that we will be able to take the first steps in this process before the budget for 2000 .
in the explanatory statement forming part of my report , I provided a very comprehensive list of the points on which the directive has now been changed following the first reading in Parliament .
Mr President , following the statements by the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and by the Commission , and following the results of the Palestinian elections , to which Mrs Ferrero-Waldner has referred , it is clear that a political , economic , social and humanitarian crisis , an economic collapse , is brewing .
we must not get fishermen to foot the bill for natural phenomena .
we will see how the point on the agenda unfolds .
after eastward enlargement to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe , we will - after China - be the largest internal market in the world .
why do we not broaden the scope of the Capital of Culture idea , however ?
these products &apos; life cycles are long and they remain in the ecosystem for a long time , which means the extent of the problems for the environment can at present only be guessed at .
it is easy to identify with them .
your rapporteur , whom I represent today , takes a firm stand against the text of the Council &apos;s common position .
I believe we would all agree that their aspiration is to overcome the immense deficiencies they suffer in both the economic field and in the field of freedoms and civil , social and political rights .
there has been mention of the possibility of later on introducing the amending budget to patch up the holes in the 2005 agriculture budget , although so far we do not know where those necessary resources are going to come from .
destabilisation attempts are merely bringing them losses .
it is important that we play a strong and future-oriented role in the next negotiations .
let us show solidarity in real terms .
I shall conclude , therefore , with my initial appeal to the Commission and the Commissioner , who has an excellent relationship with us : do not undervalue the European Parliament ’ s contribution .
this is the background to the French government &apos; s proposal that the EU &apos; s euro system should be equipped with a form of proper economic government .
it is now becoming clear how urgent it is to bring into being a genuine form of closer cooperation between the twelve countries of the eurozone , so as to make a qualitative leap in the coordination of financial , economic and social policies , and overcome - as was called for at the Lisbon Summit - a rigidly sectoral approach which , ultimately , confines social policies to a role of mere assistance .
it would be a most powerful first positive message for reform of the Treaty if the Dublin II summit were to reach immediate agreement on this new competence , designed to demonstrate that our Europe respects citizens or residents whether white or black , Christian , Jew or Muslim .
the European Union must also clamp down on the harmonization of absurdly detailed legislation and this ridiculous merry-go-round of lawnmowers , measurements for bananas and strawberries and percentages of fat in chocolate .
for years and years - going back to a period far beyond the one we are currently dealing with - they have endured with incredible patience - I would say an almost Ghandi-like patience - whatever their oppressors have thrown at them .
the support programme for the Paraguayan Parliament has already gone through three stages .
it is also important to emphasise from the outset that , while road safety is of course a key element when discussing an issue such as drivers &apos; working time , our debate today is not about road safety but about social legislation , not driving time but working time .
I should like to repeat that the Commission has reviewed the latest developments in that area .
Mr President , I would like , if I may , to deliver very briefly a few comments on this report .
fourthly , we wish to deal with the Council in terms of foreign policy and security .
I believe that , despite the differences of opinion that exist in this House on who was responsible , and I must confess that I do not agree with those who blame the NGOs or the southern countries , we must clearly state that the structure is no longer the same as it was at Marrakech .
there cannot be some rules for the larger countries and other rules for smaller countries .
the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations has indicated on several occasions that it believes that there is a direct link between a lower VAT rate and higher employment .
programmes such as NEPAD - which we support because our work on regional integration in Africa closely mirrors the strategy adopted by this new partnership - are , in my opinion , moving in the same direction .
despite this , we should , in addition to the precautionary measures that need to be observed , also consider the situations we are facing .
I will end by stressing the need for a parliamentary assembly , for that is the political forum in which a solution could well be found to many of the processes currently in progress .
it is a port which , has been pointed out , does not have the technical conditions or the location for repairing this type of vessel .
we could also consider our options with regard to freezing assets in order to get to the governing elite in Belarus .
criminal law is part of each individual nation &apos; s own cultural tradition , and it is very difficult to arrive at common definitions of what is to be understood by these basic legal concepts .
however , the little that is being given may help to ease their pain .
agreement with Morocco - Human rights in Morocco and Western Sahara
for some years , the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , which was founded during the cold war as an institution for monitoring and confidence building purposes , has been undergoing an identity crisis .
this is an issue for the Council .
the PPE-DE will support the report .
the financial crisis shows what a strong European currency and an effective central bank mean to the protection of the EU &apos;s growth and economy .
the words of the English text , which I understand to be the basic text , are : &quot; asked the Council presidency &quot; .
it is extremely disturbing that the debate on the Schleicher report , after being declared inadmissible by Parliament , was forcibly restored to the agenda this morning by an arrogant majority with minimal concern for respecting the law , as shown by Mr Barón Crespo &apos; s alarming description of the minority in this Parliament as a &apos; commando &apos; .
I feel that the Member States should better address the digital divide and ensure that , with digitisation , all individuals in all regions have equal access to public service broadcasting .
at Barcelona we must therefore reject any attempt to weaken collective bargaining and to remove from the Charter of Fundamental Rights a major part of its content .
is it that the bigger countries take the larger number ?
my group has also tabled a number of proposed amendments .
the principles behind the 1993 directive and the present proposal are the same . The 1993 directive has caused many problems for the Danish trade union movement .
in the Netherlands , 62 % of the voters said ‘ no ’ .
Mr President , in the European Union , we are very good at sanctimonious rhetoric about the need for poverty reduction in poor countries .
I should like to thank the President for having said the same thing .
I invite you , in your own way , to show your solidarity by observing a minute &apos;s silence .
in writing . - ( LT ) I voted in favour of this report and endorsed the European Parliament &apos;s decision to grant discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Maritime Safety Agency for the financial year 2009 .
if there were currently the political will , it could be implemented today , because there is nothing to prevent it - the Treaties do not prevent it - and it would in no way alter the fundamental operation of the European Union .
my impression is that he does not accept any of them , but he could at least tell us in a word , so that we do not leave the House without having understood .
it is , therefore , becoming crucial to ensure that there is rigorous protection against potential abuses or even criminal acts .
trade relations between the EU and India are significant , since the EU is India &apos;s principal trade partner and its biggest foreign investor .
we must cancel the developing countries &apos; debt .
I should like to thank the Commissioner for a thorough answer although he has not actually answered the last part of my question , namely , do there need to be two ratifications - one for EU membership and one for EEA membership ?
the 1997 Daphne programme was heavily oversubscribed with less than 10 % of applications receiving funding .
these are subjects on which are group will always be willing to offer maximum support .
. – Mr President , Commissioner , in the euro , we have one of the safest currencies in the world , and that is the way it should remain .
in writing . - Taking into account the countless number of bureaucrats in the European Parliament , as well as in the European Commission , this resolution brings the European Community closer to the well-considered and effective distribution of EC resources in the course of time .
we have to pay more for so-called ‘ organic ’ products in order to buy what should be normal food .
I have repeatedly stressed to my colleagues in the European Council and to the Commission that Europe is increasingly in competition not within itself but with other parts of the world , notably Asia .
some of these decisions are beyond my comprehension as the rapporteur , and I am sure the whole committee finds them equally baffling .
that investment will certainly be much smaller than was required for the development of nuclear energy , which is ultimately proving not to be cheap .
 
Mr Garosci is right to ask for the burden of unnecessary regulations to be lifted from small retailers especially .
1 . (
ladies and gentlemen , we have ascertained that most of the inhabitants of Malta are opposed to this hunting .
we need to move from principle to practice .
that means EUR 7 million are likely to be unusable for lack of a legal basis .
regarding the method , I wonder why on earth Parliament , in discussing the 1998 report of the European Central Bank , feels the need to include its approbation of a specific measure which the European Central Bank will give an account of in its next report - the 1999 report .
you have one minute .
controversial issues include policies on Belarus , Moldova and Ukraine , the situation in Russia itself , especially with regard to respect for human rights , and above all energy policy .
this has unacceptable consequences for the workers themselves and for the viability of the European textile sector , particularly in Portugal , which has been forced to compete with producers that systematically fail to observe such rules and rights .
in modern times in particular , these rights also include the protection of data , which is not adequately guaranteed by the SWIFT agreement negotiated with the United States .
we can be delighted that the Member States have taken vital emergency measures to prevent the risk of contagion in the EU by imposing a ban on wild birds , by using labels displaying the words ‘ locally produced poultry meat ’ , by slaughtering huge numbers of chickens , by placing quotas on species and so on .
the Union needs to be coherent in its foreign policy , as can be seen yet once more in our approach to the Great Lakes region , our fisheries policy , agricultural policy , and particularly in our arms export control .
the negotiations which the Commission has started with Canada , the USA and Russia are the first international agreement to focus on animal welfare .
I have been informed that the rapporteur has had problems with transport and will be arriving late .
need I spell out exactly what will be required of the Irish in relation to the Lisbon Treaty ?
the debate is closed .
it is high time that we made a start on this .
a short while ago , a British Member very rightly said that people who behaved badly with the French at football matches do not represent the whole of Great Britain but a part that he and many others disown .
I welcome the fact that French Prime Minister Jospin put the objectives of Union policy at the centre of his latest speech and did not , like Germany &apos; s Chancellor Schröder and Foreign Minister Fischer , largely confine himself to questions of EU institutional reform .
there was little appetite in the Council for substantially increasing the budget even though it was clear that considerable improvement of financial market supervision was called for .
politicians need to demonstrate responsibility ; making alliances with extremists who hold these kinds of views will necessarily have harmful consequences .
our constituents want reform .
violence , especially against women or children , is completely unjustifiable and cannot be accepted .
let us seek alternative policies that give priority to employment , to high-quality public services , to sustainable development and to the well-being of the people !
next Tuesday I shall be attending a meeting of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs at which I will make sure to discuss this issue and to explain in a little more detail how the ICG preparatory group is dealing with questions like this , and in particular the list of requests and proposals presented by the European Parliament , which we hope will be supplemented by the resolution to be voted upon on 23 March .
an interminable shopping list is being presented .
the first is to ensure the public &apos; s or consumers &apos; interest in being able to use both knowledge and culture .
what happened within Eurostat in the years leading up to 1999 is not evidence of the reform ’ s failure – on the contrary , it is evidence of how necessary the reform was and of the fact that the steps we took were the right ones .
secondly and in contrast with previous economic downturns , no country still in deficit embarked on unwarranted expansionary policies .
 
this was hard work for everyone concerned .
in Amendment No 5 , for example , the words &apos; doit obtenir &apos; in the original French version have been translated as &apos; debe permitirse &apos; , which is not the same thing .
the government has a responsibility to stand up for the interests of its people , all of its people .
another objection is that the wrong Parliament Committee - Women &apos;s Rights - has led on this proposal .
the &apos; safe harbour &apos; scheme does at least represent an attempt to guarantee data protection beyond EU borders .
the reduction of 0 % approved by Parliament for cereals seems unrealistic .
that is the rule of the game .
we must know what we want once and for all .
whilst the Commission is not convinced that the measure will or may create jobs , research carried out by the Netherlands Economic and Social Institute for SMEs found that it could possibly create 66 000 jobs .
the second point I wish raise is this : I really would ask for more sensible timetabling in future .
the European Union and Canada have agreed to cooperate on air transport with the aim of mitigating the impact of aviation on climate change .
Mr President , I understand Mr Duff &apos;s point and , as ever , the theory is right but the practice is not .
the latter are potentially high , predictable risks , with regard to which it is becoming essential to base proposals squarely on the precautionary principle when setting exposure limits .
Mr Herrero-Tejedor , I have given you the floor in order to avoid pointless arguments , but I must tell you that Rule 145 relates to accusations made against a Member on a personal level .
in my office in recent weeks , three colleagues have been attacked .
in the past , we have called for the introduction of a supercommissioner for sustainable development .
I think that is a lesson to the doomsayers , and I am encouraged that a compromise is possible .
I hope my other colleagues will pick up the last few remaining points I wanted to make .
this unnecessary delay reached its peak with the refusal to deal with the report by means of the urgency procedure , which would have allowed it to enter into force this May .
but with the continued political stalemate , closures and also frozen fiscal revenues , the TIM can only provide temporary relief .
this type of labelling requires public confidence and a link with the environmental movement .
we should involve independent organisations such as the OECD more closely so as to achieve a more objective debate .
the European Union negotiations , which are very strong with regard to trade and , in our opinion , excessive with regard to liberalisation , should now also be based , in a balanced manner , around human rights and the environment .
these continuing problems are putting a strain on a sector of European industry that has had to cope with a difficult adaptation process in recent years .
Mr President-in-Office , you spoke of the important decision to appoint a Mr or Mrs CFSP .
not only does that cost the taxpayers of Europe an extra EUR 200 million a year , but it emits 192 000 tonnes of CO2 - equivalent to 49 000 hot air balloons .
not long ago , very recently , in my region - I am from the Veneto - an event was held known as Vinitaly , which is one of the most important events in the world of wine and a hugely successful petition was drawn up there in defence of rosé wines .
the natural family is the space for protection of children , and parents are their first protectors .
Mrs Frassoni and a number of others – to whom I am very grateful , because this was an important issue for the Austrian Presidency – mentioned transparency .
could this mean an extension of the transitional period ?
your response to the present situation was indeed the right one .
yet , this &apos; no &apos; vote casts major doubts over the timetable for ratification , and perhaps even as to whether ratification will be achieved .
secondly , I shall not vote for this Commission because I do not believe that in real substance anything has changed in the last few weeks as a result of the hearings which we have had .
thanks to the Employment Pact , which we hope to adopt in Cologne , we want to give the people of Europe a sign that the European Union is looking at their concerns .
this is the real question we must ask ourselves and the proposals we must put to the Council , including the no-fly zone and patrols of the Libyan coastline , which is the duty of European ships in the Gulf of Sidra , not American ones .
there is a lot of disagreement on this issue , and a new debate is being held between those in favour of statutory regulation and those in favour of codes of conduct and voluntary arrangements .
however , the various kinds of State aid involved changes things .
I think that it would make sense for us to be included in the work of this high-level group .
we also need to examine , though this has not yet been discussed in detail , whether he should be given some kind of rights in this respect , but this is not clear at the moment .
the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region was endorsed during the Swedish Presidency .
the intergovernmental method is simply an aid to be used when the community method is not available for reasons relating to the Treaty .
they are afraid of resolving claims in another country and do not know about counterfeit medicines sold on the Internet .
subject : Workers from Romania and Bulgaria
we learned that lesson when BSE originally came in .
we are generally able to express our opinion , but whether this will have any consequences or not is in the lap of the gods .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , I would simply like to touch upon the question that has been raised by several Members of this Parliament on compatibility with EU policies .
( FR ) Madam President , Commissioner , yes , a reform of the COM in wine is desirable , but are the means put forward by the Commission the most suitable ?
it has invested resources and interest in Cambodia .
however , I think that the euro itself is going to cause more damage to Europe than the nickel in the coin could cause .
( FI ) Mr President , I would just like to say that one important point in the Finnish version of this resolution has been translated wrongly .
Parliament has decided in the Committee on Development and Cooperation that this should stop .
for example , the Court of Auditors states that , for projects in the area of cohesion , the level of error is higher than 5 % , which , in my opinion , is too high , despite the fact that there has been an improvement in recent years .
I would even go one step further and suggest there be a new Directive dealing with the education of the children of migrants .
furthermore , I would also like to point out that on Monday the Council approved its conclusions on relations with the Cuban Government , in which it once again stated its intention to maintain the dialogue with civil society and offered to restore the dialogue with the Cuban Government on the basis of mutual , reciprocal and non-discriminatory interest .
the report by Mrs Mathieu , on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control , on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Railway Agency for the financial year 2008 ( SEC ( 2009 ) 1089 - C7-0197 / 2009 - ,
unfortunately , I see Marco Polo as being part of the Commission &apos;s programme to forcibly shift traffic from the roads to the railways .
Europeans should be told that , in 2005 , this cheque exceeds the whole European research budget .
I have no great enthusiasm for it - quite the reverse . But I know that they fought courageously .
at the time of the Austrian elections , when the coalition came into being , we accused this law-abiding country of illegality and sought to use all our powers to get our own way , and the same is happening now .
the Atlantic Alliance is something that will further assist the creation of civil society , the rule of law and respect for human rights in my country during my presidency .
the work in this area continues , then .
please behave properly .
from the point of view of the Commission and the European Parliament it is more important that they ensure the quality of the accession process rather than its speed .
taxation on vehicles in Member States varies widely .
concerning Mr Evans &apos; point regarding the implications for businesses , it is important that the cost-benefit analysis should be seriously conducted .
the cavalier way that privacy concerns are treated in the Council is deeply worrying .
it is clear that it is unquestionably incumbent upon us to find the fairest possible way of addressing the issue of some of the assets of Holocaust victims .
I am not , of course , even in favour of membership of the European Union .
we must bear in mind - and this is my final point - that other disasters can happen ; we know , for example , that Lake Kivu contains huge methane resources and that the lava which is flowing into these waters risks is causing many other problems as well .
their input was of great value and is much appreciated .
so far as naming and shaming is concerned , I am not sure that would be the effect but I am prepared to work on the basis that if a law is worth passing in the Council of Ministers , it must be worth transposing and , indeed , it must be worth applying and enforcing in a Member State .
it is mandatory to take all necessary measures to enhance the technical performances of screening equipment , as well as to apply a single check in the case of transit flights , which would enable a reduction of processing time and , in the mid- to long-term , the effective decrease of actual costs .
the Court ’ s observations on Eurostat management related to inadequate procedures for the award of certain contracts .
I trust that , like the Union itself , it will become a community of nation states and citizens , because Europe owes its greatness to its nations .
having said that , I in turn hope that this office will prosper , and for this to happen the old confrontations between the Commission , Parliament and the Council are of no import . But we must all tend this plant which is just beginning to take root , so that it can bear fruit for the good of the European Union , its economic and , above all , its fiscal policies .
very briefly to draw attention once again to the urgent need to establish a European policy on tourism , in view of the inexplicable absence of any such policy from the Treaty of Amsterdam .
I hope that the Commissioner will advise us as to how Parliament should tackle this .
however , people who are older than 55 are often very useful in voluntary work , in an advisory role or as childminders .
I believe that this report expresses a very strong commitment to the aid for trade agenda which I fully share .
these difficulties were resolved by bringing into the text detailed and transparent wording on the weighting to be given to geographic coverage , public safety and protection services and the range of services provided to consumers in rural and remote areas .
the military objective slowed down somewhat during the Swedish Presidency , although that Presidency did make good use of its time to develop civil crisis procedures and management bodies .
we must also ensure that our trading partners also honour their commitments .
I hope that is going to be followed through properly because what has happened in the past is that Norway has sent salmon into countries such as Denmark at the minimum price , and it was then processed and came out of those factories at a very much lower price than it originally went in .
Parliament will have to check and monitor the future progress of events , and at the moment , when things are going well , you still have our confidence .
Famagusta is a city on the east coast of Cyprus .
the letter goes on to state something even more surprising , namely that the European Union must refer to the information which the United States holds on expropriated assets before helping any business wishing to invest in Cuba .
if we were not so influential , we would not currently be the legislator in 75 % of cases and we would not be a co-legislator in almost 100 % of cases with regard to the Treaty of Lisbon , and then it would , in fact , be the case that decisions in Europe would be made by bureaucratic means .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur , Mr Costa , on his report and on the excellent conclusions that he set out , which , by the way , have been approved almost unanimously by the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs .
and I am counting on the fact that , whilst defending their individual interests , the Member States will measure up to the issue : the unification of our continent along the lines of a community model that has served us so well up to now .
does that mean that Europe should ignore Central Asia ?
I submitted a great number of amendments in French and signed them myself .
would it be able in some way to intervene in the decisions taken by the Council ?
we will thus be able to avoid a duplication and therefore dilution of any efforts made .
we need strong , solid and reliable partners in Latin America .
the final text , which is the outcome of an extremely thorough debate to which we contributed various proposals , addresses various aspects of this issue and makes certain demands , specifically :
currently , sections of the network are being built in Member States .
there is a question of economic credibility at play here .
from this point of view , I think that the clear position that has been taken with regard to the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli Government is logical and in line with the position of the Council .
their background , in both cases , seems to me to be appropriate .
one potential and very important source for Central European and Baltic States would be the use of the emission credits accumulated under the Kyoto Protocol &apos;s emissions trading system , thereby profiting from these countries &apos; climate resources .
let me say something on that subject .
women &apos;s rights and equal opportunities in Mediterranean countries
it was not by chance that a party that received a larger number of votes was invited to form the government , but that it then passed on to the party with the third largest number of votes .
I also commit the Presidency to a continuation of this dialogue with Parliament and to regular exchanges of views with it on the various measures that are decided on in order to address the problems faced by the countries affected by the disaster .
the possibility of living , working and moving freely within the EU , and the removal of as many financial and administrative obstacles to doing so as possible , is indeed a tangible benefit conferred on the citizens of Europe by EU membership ’ .
the debate is closed .
we feel that the compromise of going a step at a time opens up a perspective that everyone can accept .
why did the Commission not take more time and , in line with Lisbon , draft the guidelines in an interdisciplinary manner , as prepared by the different DGs ?
the citizens need to understand at long last who is deciding what in Brussels and with what legitimacy .
in remembering this anniversary , an anniversary which is important for Europe , we express solidarity , today , with the people of Belarus , who are also our neighbours , and who are still waiting for freedom and democracy to come to their country .
arms exports are violating human rights all over the world .
the Commission &apos;s proposals on improving economic governance are of the highest importance for the future of the EU and for economic growth .
( Explanation of vote cut pursuant to Rule 163 of the Rules of Procedure )
monopolies and duopolies have been dissolved to the benefit of consumers and users , which is important .
the resolution , however , does not attribute responsibility for the extremely serious current situation , and does not draw the proper conclusions from its diagnosis since it does not call into question the policies underlying it , the following being some examples :
there are certain &quot; legal grey areas &quot; .
even the sending of special units by the Gulf Cooperation Council to protect important infrastructure facilities in Bahrain is controversial , because the Shiite opposition is calling on the international community to protect the people from military intervention .
of course , it would work out cheap if it did not have to bear all those costs .
but how do you intend to change the climate ?
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the report by Mr Pérez Royo is to be welcomed for the balanced approach and technical competence employed in its preparation .
there was very little doubt as to the Commission &apos; s views and its original proposal .
if the Commission does not act next week , if this drags on for more than a few more days , then the argument in Britain will shift .
it is true that the Slovenian Parliament has ratified the Lisbon Treaty without the official consolidated text , because it is not yet available .
Mr President , without doubt the directive proposed by the European Commission is an important step towards the creation of a single area of freedom , security and justice . It organises judicial cooperation at Community level and introduces uniform rules in international private law , an area in which they were sorely lacking .
and second , please raise your hands .
using European resources to protect forests against atmospheric pollution that ignores frontiers and protecting Community forests against fires are Community activities that are worth strengthening and continuing .
the Council is clinging on to the right of veto , unanimity and blocking majorities .
– Mr President , the earthquake on 26 December virtually destroyed the city of Bam .
the European Union is also taking tangible action towards resolving the conflict .
I would also like to emphasise the Year of Equal Opportunities , which will give us the chance to raise awareness of these complex and sensitive issues .
let me explain briefly why I am doing so .
indeed we could offer it a role in the Petersburg Task to be pursued by the Western European Union following ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty .
taking this into account , a common single register for all institutions would , I believe , be very difficult to achieve and would in fact put in place an over-bureaucratic procedure for applying for access when lobbying only the Parliament .
it is commendable that the energy review carried out by the Commission names the infrastructures whose creation would be in the common interest of all Member States .
what is positive , though , is that public places frequented by vulnerable groups ( parks , sports and recreational areas , schools and suchlike ) will be better protected .
there are generally financial reasons behind the current tendency to provide and perform undeclared domestic work , because undeclared work is more advantageous to both parties than officially registered work which , besides tax and deductions , burdens both parties with extensive bureaucratic demands .
I am confident that these problems will be dealt with and taken into account by the Commission and that an effective trade agreement will be agreed .
that is why we are trying to convince all Member States to accept that target and , certainly , afterwards there has to be a mobilisation of resources , some from Member States and some from the European Union .
I thank you very sincerely for what you did in relation to bringing a greater degree of openness and transparency to the workings of this Parliament .
honourable Members , please also allow me to address two specific problems mentioned in Mr Mulder &apos;s report , on the one hand , the delays in the introduction of IACS in Greece , and on the other , the considerations linked to enlargement .
the European Union may have begun its race towards levels of development already seen in America &apos; s economy and businesses , but this , the real Europe , will not become a reality until the convergence of national economies and internal economic and social cohesion are given top priority .
for all these reasons , we believe that gradual , vertical decoupling of aid is possible , with a view to gradually limiting the application of the measure to a few sectors .
coming as I do from a large Member State , I have seen only that the centralised allocation of tasks does not necessarily represent an improvement , but that individuals must really be helped where they actually are , and that , I believe , is done better by the Member States .
I refer in particular to the Western Balkans investment framework , now being launched , as well as to the Eastern Partnership announced by the European Council in recent days which will build on the good cooperation we have already established through our memorandum of understanding and the neighbourhood investment facility .
a single European system would mean : subjecting Members to tax arrangements different to those applied to the citizens who voted for them ; establishing Members as representatives of a hypothetical &apos; European people &apos; ; detracting from their standing as representatives of their own peoples , whereas they are genuine equals of the members of national parliaments , and disengaging them a little further from national and popular ties of belonging to a Member State .
far be it from me to interfere in French internal politics - I am not a Muslim , indeed I am not a follower of any religion - but my belief is that this would not address the challenge that France faces in integrating Muslims and other minorities into its society .
we support democratic conditions in Kenya .
we hope for concrete action in the future .
general Budget for 2002
I firmly believe that Intelligent Transport Systems will increase traffic efficiency , thereby reducing traffic .
this is why I urge this issue to be taken into account by the Commission in its quest for resources , including the use of funds from the European Investment Bank .
we need effective strategic plans which include appropriate EU financial aid for promoting democracy , civil society and human rights .
I refuse to back the Zingaretti report , though , and for a variety of reasons .
the Green Paper discusses how a better regulatory framework will increase trade between countries , but the top priority in a consumer regulatory framework must still be to reinforce consumer rights .
the problem of fundamental rights , most importantly women &apos;s rights , remains intact .
the EU has to look at this .
in the case in question , there are no technical difficulties to justify that exception , and the regulation has been substantially amended throughout its negotiation to give it more flexibility , in such a way that , in our opinion , all the difficulties raised by the different Member States can be resolved within the margins of flexibility which the regulation allows .
we can no longer turn a blind eye to what is nothing more and nothing less than neo-colonial plundering in disguise .
contrary to some concerns , differentiating between food and non-alcoholic beverages , on the one hand , and alcoholic beverages , on the other hand , does not create a serious administrative burden for businesses .
it is sober and balanced , with certain themes for consideration , but without ideological excursions and ideas which have no connection with the real world .
for example , if it is a question of banning the HADEP - unacceptable .
for Hungary , like all the new Member States , meeting the convergence criteria is a key requirement , as well as being in the country ’ s own interests .
approval of the Minutes
by doing so , they have contributed to the economic growth of these countries .
I must say , not for the first time , that I agree wholeheartedly with the chairman of the Committee on Transport and Tourism in the strong emphasis he puts on the connection between fair competition and decent working conditions .
the joint action of 28 November also introduces measures to implement a moratorium on the production of anti-personnel landmines and emphasizes the need , as has been stated by a number of speakers , for early ratification of the convention .
I hope that on this occasion we managed to safeguard the principle at least partially , but how much time was spent doing this !
OLAF is a Commission department , but it conducts its investigations in total independence .
they are often based in countries in the developing world or countries in the former Soviet Union .
the treaty is about more than these innovations ; it is about the text as a whole .
I want to stress that the members of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection took a unanimous decision to table this oral question to ask the Commissioner for an update regarding the ongoing infringement proceedings against nine Member States concerning restrictions imposed on sports betting markets .
equality should be understood in a real sense and not by isolating individuals ( especially women ) from their relationships with their partners , children and the social context in which sexuality and reproductive ability are actually exercised .
( NL ) I should like to say a few things about the European Commission &apos;s expenditure in the framework of external relations .
in this connection it has expressly allowed the institutions of the European Union scope to assess , evaluate and forecast the situation .
if we want to maintain our European social model , we cannot go presenting Asian businesses with European ports on a silver platter – and , by the way , our European ports are in any case much more efficient than Asian ones these days .
in conclusion , I would like to say that we judge relations between the EU and Tunisia as solid and friendly and that we believe that there is indeed a potential for further strengthening of those relations .
unfortunately , there are only a few of us here .
according to the International Peace Bureau , NATO &apos; has so far done nothing but accelerate the repression , unite the Serbian nation around Milosevic and alienate the Russians &apos; .
going home , unable to telephone , no means of communication and finally hearing about friends who are in shock , injured or in hospital .
in addition to these efforts through the Global Fund and through bilateral action , the Commission is actively participating in international forums for dealing with poverty-related illnesses – I am thinking in particular here of the World Trade Organisation , of the United Nations General Assembly special session on HIV / AIDS , of the G8 , and of conferences like the one in Toronto as well .
enormous progress has been made towards the creation of a common European asylum system in the last decade .
it is not by taking money away from the farmers that we will fill a gap as huge as rural development in the European budget under this financial perspective .
why ?
let me just say , with reference to this , that this Financial Regulation and the Commission have now – to take just one example – wrecked the network of Europe Houses that has existed for 50 years .
furthermore , in the Commission ’ s programming document for the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights for 2005 and 2006 for Campaign 2 , called &apos; Fostering a culture of human rights &apos; , for which Cambodia is eligible , it is planned to address the issue of trafficking in children and women .
we have plenty of examples of this , starting with European legislation which Parliament usually pushes further than the Council of Ministers would like .
totalitarian regimes do not spring up overnight .
my second observation is this : Mr Corbett said , and rightly , that Parliament acquired the right of codecision over a period of time and that there is therefore something missing from Article 250 ( 2 ) , in that it states only that the Commission can no longer withdraw legislation once the Council has delivered its Common Position , but it does not state that it could not do so either following the first reading in this House .
faced with these facts , we cannot evade the question as to whether the policy we are applying is the right one .
it is highly likely that these shortcomings are repeated throughout the canon of EU environmental law .
the report does not seek to sensationalise or exaggerate perceived dangers , but it does provide a useful framework to encourage public awareness of the risks involved and to provide practical remedies .
since fixing the election in March , Mugabe has now deliberately destroyed the homes and livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of the poorest Zimbabweans , while millions more continue to rely on international food aid for their survival .
( NL ) Mr President , the text before us is , indeed , a compromise and we would have liked to have been a little more ambitious here and there , particularly when it comes to the timing and the level of the penalties .
we have therefore voted against it in the final vote .
given the mortal danger posed to the world by the greenhouse effect , proposals that seek to improve measures taken to reduce the scale of the threat cannot be neglected .
we must therefore be realistic and , more importantly , seek to obtain a positive return , as suggested here , on waste treatment , in terms of energy .
I would particularly like to draw your attention , Commissioner , to the issue of cross-border sections .
at least 20 % of funding under the geographical programmes should go into these life-saving sectors of basic health and basic education .
the debate is closed .
it is a marked improvement .
what can the Commission do , and what can Frontex do ?
ladies and gentlemen , that is our objective .
and the willingness to provide common funding for those proposals simply is not there .
and thirdly , what must we do in the long-term ?
in other words , we need to view from the opposite side , too .
in the much-needed deepening of the democratic aspects of the EU , which is still today suffering from a democratic deficit in some areas , fulfilling the aforementioned mandate will constitute one more very important step in the representation of the citizens of the EU in the European Parliament , which has been repeatedly pointing out the need for this .
we already have legislation .
I would therefore also like to thank the rapporteurs very much for their excellent work .
( applause )
Mr President , on this occasion it is the car industry and Renault which are concerned .
no food product which is genetically modified or contains ingredients which have been genetically modified should be released into the food chain until it has been fully tested , and only then with clear labelling .
. – Mr President , State aid , in other words the workers &apos; money , is in the firing line , the objective being to reduce it and have management of it controlled by the European Union , so that it can serve the Lisbon Strategy .
since then , the Commission must confirm what the Members have said .
it would have helped if he had been at the vote last year when his colleagues opposed a ban on the use of these body scanners without a fundamental review of human rights .
Mr President , the turnout at this year &apos; s election for the European Parliament fell in almost all Member States where other elections had not been arranged at the same time .
the fact that he hides his stance behind a proposal for a referendum – in which every EU citizen would be asked to voice their opinion on the matter – does not justify that stance .
indeed , this is an important and most valid point .
we will not be a true Union without a vigorous cohesion policy .
once again , I shall repeat myself : the globalization of the economy should be done with and on behalf of citizens , who are also workers .
could I also ask for particular attention to be paid to the opportunities offered by technological developments , such as systems which disable the start mechanism of the car when the driver has drunk too much ?
that is a worrying precedent for the future .
I urge the Commission to bring forward the results of its investigation as a matter of urgency .
as we all know , the last 30 years have seen an excessive increase in public spending in Europe , which has forced Member States to raise taxes to an unsustainable level .
finally , the CAP should pay more attention to small , family-owned agricultural holdings , given the need for diversification to ...
what needs to happen ?
but it is not a lack of courtesy .
we have a general product safety law , we have a toy safety law but we need to step up enforcement and inspection regimes .
so in conclusion , taking the cue from the title of Agenda 2000 , a definite yes to a wider Union , provided that the conditions for an institutionally and financially stronger Union , which do not exist today , are created .
I see this as not only a symbolic event , but also an important step along the road towards European integration .
I also look forward to having a clear and detailed provision and would like to see a draft bill for us to debate .
we have not yet reached that point .
( the Minutes were approved )
let us hope that it will come to a speedy end .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to tell the House that we are preparing a framework directive on minimum efficiency requirements in the office communication equipment sector , amongst others , a directive which I hope will be presented to this House and the Council during next year .
it is a badly-kept secret that the accompanying measures have largely centred on the question of the Port of Famagusta .
there are cures for these ills in the form of independent scrutiny .
not only I , but also my staff and collaborators who have worked so hard on this proposal , take satisfaction from that .
we complied .
let us , therefore , emphasise these positive aspects and create this dynamic and I hope that the European Council at the end of this month will not supply the sceptics and the Cassandras , who are already saying that we need a plan B , with ammunition .
this latter point is of particular importance to me and my constituents in the Province of Leinster .
would the minister not accept that , in fact , air transport is probably one of the cleanest , most environmentally friendly ways of transporting people and goods across Europe and that it would be wrong to target air transport in this way ?
I see no evidence that the Commission is actually ensuring that the Member States being urged to engage in fiscal consolidation are taking account of the fact that we must not drive these people - who are already suffering pain - into more pain , and drive people who are currently on the margins into poverty .
I believe that it makes sense to introduce a permanent system for monitoring Christian persecution .
together we must each play our part in reducing unemployment and increasing employment opportunities in Europe .
criticism , Mr President , is also a little like wills , in that only the most recent one is valid .
( FR ) Mr President , my question is aimed at the Presidency-in-Office of the Council .
we are delighted at this of course , but much work remains to be done .
many experts predict that the political strength to say no to Turkey will not be found anywhere in ten years ’ time , even if she did not meet the conditions of membership .
the Commission encourages Member States to take such actions .
of course , the Treaty lacks the simplicity of its late , lamented predecessor , but it preserves all the principal reforms .
establishment of an effective Human Rights Committee is an important objective .
these are two completely different things .
the building where we were that afternoon had been closed and was now open .
I specifically asked for that .
organising harmonised standards in the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste responds to a demand and a need to strengthen safety in this area .
I do not agree with him that we need a tax on currency speculation but certainly we need to avoid this kind of movement .
this is also what India suggested last weekend .
however , we cannot ignore the fact that the damage caused by the sinking of the is estimated at a minimum of EUR 5 billion .
( the sitting was suspended at 1 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
this represents a social imbalance .
I feel that Mr Becsey &apos;s report is innovative because it brings this issue back to the discussion table , however from a new angle , going outside the banking system to identify solutions to the current financial deadlock .
Parliament &apos;s priorities were clear and the Commission &apos;s priorities contained too much of Mr Kinnock &apos;s &apos; employment is money &apos; ; I do not believe that is the aim and I think it is contrary to what was decided in Amsterdam .
I can assure you that the College of Quaestors will look into the matter and will possibly come forward with new proposals .
I must therefore object most strongly to Mr La Russa ’ s proposal , as if this House were to postpone human rights resolutions every time it received a letter from an embassy , it would make no progress whatsoever with its work in this field .
Madam President , I too wish to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report .
10 . Second &apos; Marco Polo &apos; programme (
the amended regulation establishing the Frontex agency should be adopted by the Council and the European Parliament as soon as possible .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this was supposed to be called the development round , but frankly I think we can sum it up like this : the winner is the self-interest of the Northern countries of the world . The interests of US and European multinationals – effectively sponsored and represented by the work of the European Commission – have won yet again .
we have all argued that EU Member States already meet the additional security criteria as set out in the reform legislation recently adopted by the United States .
indeed fears are growing here .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , not only have I listened carefully to what has been said tonight , and not only have I paid attention to what was said in the report by the Court of Auditors , but also , as I said before , I have just come back from a visit to Côte d &apos;Ivoire and Liberia and have seen with my own eyes what the needs of these countries are in the field of health .
trade in services ( debate )
there are a million people homeless in Haiti ; 230 000 have died ; 300 000 are injured .
so let us try , and permit me some additional clarifications .
. – Mr President , no political transition is easy .
principally that recommendations include a common regulatory policy similar in concept to the common agricultural and fisheries policies , which have proved disastrous .
the first , and perhaps most important , is the official announcement in Laeken last year that the European Union is now ready to carry out certain operations and is gradually moving towards full operational capability which will allow it to take on even the most demanding of Petersburg-type missions .
all the trauma we have gone through will have been worthwhile if the correct lessons are learned and applied .
when people say we should use Article 129 , they forget that , according to that article , it is not possible to adopt measures to harmonize the Member States &apos; legal and statutory provisions .
the perception that Chinese economic growth has no parallel in the respect of human rights and democracy in that country , nor in its actions at international level , the exploitation of workers , a regulatory framework on labour that is incomparably less demanding , disregard for environmental matters and for rules on intellectual property and patents , all these factors are barriers to open trade relations that are marked by respect for international good practice .
the first Treaty of Rome launched European unification ; the second must - and will - bring about the transition to the new reunified Europe : a Union which is politically and economically stronger , destined to become an element of stability and prosperity on the world stage .
among the main focal points were the strengthening of the security forces by the Palestinians themselves , the issue of the development of settlements , especially around Jerusalem , economic development , restricted freedom of movement in the West Bank and , lastly , the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip , which is cut off and subject to international sanctions .
in a way , we have to link all the issues together .
it forms the basis of the legitimacy of the European Union .
however , each case will be judged on the basis of European competition law .
I would highlight three points , however : the first is that the preamble is of course satisfactory , because it makes note of our heritage from the Greek and Roman civilisation , but I find it incomprehensible that it makes no note of our Christian heritage .
great countries and great nations should be magnanimous .
we always use special pleading about the minutiae as an intellectual fig leaf to avoid the tough decisions .
with your communication on a common asylum procedure and a uniform status valid throughout the Union for persons granted asylum you have brought forward some excellent proposals for harmonising asylum policy .
it is good that my fellow MEPs in the Committee on Agriculture are going to Mali in April where they are to defend today ’ s report before the ACP-EU Assembly .
I believe that the benefits offered by adopting the euro , involving macroeconomic stability , a significant reduction in price fluctuations , the promotion of job creation and support for productivity growth , all underpinned by strengthening resistance to external shocks , justify all the efforts made by the new Member States , especially Romania , to meet the convergence criteria as soon as possible and join the euro area .
that , in some countries , is the only way to effect change .
in addition , we have always tried to create opportunities to generate a climate of opinion that is favourable to the peace process and we have worked to ease tension .
how reliable is fishing data , as long as there are still large amounts of fish being caught illegally , as British fisherman David Cox recently admitted in Fishing News ?
just take the paradigmatic case of Cuba , and I only mention this as one example .
Madam President , firstly – and you have heard me say this before – we will have to live with the issue of climate change for a very long time – maybe for generations .
I would also add : How do they view subsidiarity ?
for there is indeed a strong risk that people will simply become used to the situation .
it should also encourage trade on the internal market as well as synergies among the various regions , which are today characterised by enormous socio-economic disparities .
however , it is quite clear to Parliament that the implementation of the measures is a long way behind schedule .
this begins with separation and clarification of the issue , which means that we separate the refugee issue from illegal immigration , we use our existing principles that we can build on , such as solidarity and cooperation , and we use our existing institutions such as FRONTEX , or our existing rules .
in the last discussion we held in this Chamber on the Michelin case , I had said that such changes are by no means a smooth operation since we are living in an age of major restructuring , technological advances , changes in the work place , and expanding globalisation .
the main aspects are correctly presented in the report .
subsequently , the GUE / NGL Group declared that it was withdrawing the nomination of Mrs González Álvarez from the election .
we can see enormous social and economic problems on our doorsteps , such as in Ukraine , and in North Africa .
can the EU now sustain a strategic relationship with a country so unstable and particularly given our generous concessions over trade and aid ?
yesterday the government of the Czech Prime Minister and EU Council President Mirek Topolánek lost a vote of confidence .
Madam President , I should like to speak directly to Mr Marín and tell him , first of all , that I really am very sorry at the way this part of the sitting is going .
finally , I congratulate Mr Van Rens .
 
Mr Poos has evidently not read this amendment , which takes as its reference value the resolution that this House will be adopting tomorrow , it being a minimum precondition for the European Union &apos;s involvement in Iraq that there should be a UN resolution , that the money should be put in a trust fund controlled by the World Bank and the United Nations , that the Iraqi people should be involved in the processes of democratisation , in the adoption of a constitution and of the establishment of institutions , all of which are now needed , and , above all , that the oil industry should be placed in the hands of the United Nations , in order that it may be a source of funding for the country &apos;s reconstruction .
indeed , we need a strong impetus , expertise and a decision timetable which the European Central Bank could draw up and which the Council of Ministers for the euro area , presided by your good self , Mr Juncker , could then adopt and implement .
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) I am very familiar with that situation and I am very familiar with the issue the Government of Malta has raised in that regard , and your question is covered by the answer I have already given to a fellow Member : the Presidency is aware , and Portugal as a Member State is aware , that Portugal is also a country of the South , and we too will therefore do our utmost to ensure that the word &apos; solidarity &apos; is actually put into practice while bearing in mind the difficulties and problems , which do exist , though like many cases this one also requires perseverance and persistence .
rather , it seems to me , the crucial point is to scrutinise systematically the human rights records of our partners and to induce them through political and assistance means to live up to their obligations under the human rights clause of the agreement .
subject : Aid to Christians driven out of the Molucca Islands Particular attention should be drawn to the persecution , violence and terror perpetrated against the Christian population of the Molucca Islands in Indonesia by Jihad militants , especially on the island of Ambon , which has resulted in the desecration and burning of churches , Christians being forced to flee en masse , and a large number of deaths .
the next item is Question Time ( B6-0227 / 09 ) .
we should , of course , avoid bureaucracy and duplication but , as Mrs Ferrero-Waldner said , we are building a new body .
the debate is closed .
how will the Commission ensure the future provision of funding for this work ?
a government sworn into office just six days ago is the target of fierce accusations from Spanish ministers , when much more serious incidents have taken place in Spain .
A4-0412 / 98 by Mr Azzolini , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , on the communication from the Commission to the Member States on regional policy and competition policy ( COM ( 98 ) 0673 - C4-0247 / 98 ) ; -A4-0421 / 98 by Mrs Riis-Jørgensen , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy , on the XXVIIth report by the Commission on Competition Policy - 1997 ( SEC ( 98 ) 0636 - C4-0379 / 98 ) .
I have some comments concerning the legal aspect .
the MEPs of the New Democracy ( ND ) party have decided to abstain from the final vote on the resolution on the situation in Georgia .
the European Union and Latin America have been developing a strong strategic partnership for years .
Madam President , I hope we are capable of overcoming this first great crisis which is currently facing us in the European Union .
I agree with his analysis .
Mr President of the Council , I am grateful for your reply but I would point out to you that in our experience when a question is not put at the right time , the Council or the Commission will say it has not been put at the right time .
a further point was how private copying should be regulated in the digital environment .
the reform proposed by the Commission will cause 28 000 job losses in an environment in which there is clear discrimination in allowing northern countries to take additional catches whilst denying this option to those of the south .
I trust this morning &apos;s vote will provide confirmation of this .
this is what we must focus on for both the present and the future of the EU .
recent studies have shown that oestradiol 17â is carcinogenic .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , how could I fail to agree with your speech this morning .
a high level does not necessarily imply uniform protection .
this report confines itself to other matters not mentioned in the title .
we present some recommendations for what should be done with regard to market surveillance in general , but , of course , we also provide some very specific recommendations for what a revision of the General Product Safety Directive should contain .
but , to address Mr Bonde from Denmark , we have absolutely no intention of influencing the Danish referendum on 28 May with our debate today .
the legal basis of ARGO not only establishes general objectives , it also defines more precise objectives in each of the following areas : external borders , visas , asylum and emigration .
the EU &apos;s regional support programmes , such as EuroMed-Market , ANIMA , and EuroMed-Innovation , are helping to improve conditions for investment and entrepreneurial initiatives and are thereby strengthening the private sector , while small and medium-sized enterprises in particular can avail themselves of the European Investment Bank &apos;s Facility for Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partnership ( FEMIP ) , which is a well-equipped , tried and tested support instrument supporting not only them but also environmental , infrastructure-related and educational projects .
if you take the &apos; demos &apos; out of democracy you are left only with the &apos; kratos &apos; , with the power of a system that must compel by force of law what it may not ask in the name of civic patriotism .
we hear of all sorts of things taking place , for example birds being kept in cages , and snakes and other reptiles in urban flats .
in order to reduce the time lag between promises , specific projects and payment , the budgetary authorities need to decide on a balanced ratio between commitment and payment appropriations and there needs to be real pressure to speed up the implementation of programmes .
I rebel .
the work we did in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs went very smoothly and most of the committee stands behind the report .
the dominance of the American film industry is also reflected in the grossly excessive trade deficit of EUR 6.8 billion .
Mr President , in view of its positive impact on consumer protection , the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens &apos; Rights welcomes the proposal for a directive , which , by widening the scope of producers &apos; liability for defective products to cover all movables , extends the 1985 Directive to include agricultural products .
I would be pleased if the European Union could provide a balanced response in this respect .
although reference has been made to the environment and technological dimensions , and to much else besides , we also know that it is above all for the sake of the new and future Member States of the EU that alternatives to roads are needed , for without them , we really are going to end up as roadkill , and what better alternative could there be than a well-developed and therefore well-used infrastructure in Corridor 7 of the Trans-European Network ?
while we are sitting here today at this hour discussing measures for greater food safety , people throughout the European Union are sitting in restaurants or at home and enjoying their food , and are unlikely to be asking if their food is safe .
the same company applies different standards concerning breaks , lunch time and notices of termination .
the amounts so far put forward are indicative of pressure from the bigger countries as regards their financial contribution , and effectively put paid to a cohesion policy and a common agricultural policy that protects food sovereignty , small and medium-sized farmers and the rural world .
thus Kosovo could end up as an isolated enclave , deprived of EU membership but bankrolled by EU taxpayers for decades to come .
the French said &apos; no &apos; and the Dutch said &apos; no &apos; , but you refused to accept these democratic results and you took part , with many Members of this Parliament , in the absolute deceit that is the Lisbon Treaty .
Madam President , I should like to make a suggestion that would save a great deal of time in debates of this kind .
finally , I support the European Commission &apos; s intent to formulate an ambitious European poverty standard and to drastically reduce poverty within a ten-year period .
human rights must be at the core of Russian relations .
Commissioner , I hope you can address , in particular , Amendment No 19 which calls for an evaluation report by the Commission to be placed before Parliament and the Council within two years .
there are not that many and I therefore believe that we can bring this to a good conclusion here as well .
if it then proves that the system hampers the development of those who are competitive , we can increase circulation at Community level and ensure that , where reserves exist , they are properly used .
here , I think we have been smart in striking a balance by opening up the market and offering consumers new opportunities , while also , at the same time , keeping the operation of gas networks economically interesting .
( FR ) Mr President , Madam President , I thank Mrs Thun Und Hohenstein for the conscientiousness of her work and the overall quality of her report .
that was the former Romany concentration camp , Lety , in the present Czech Republic , at those times under Nazi occupation .
and so the last misgivings have now melted away .
there is some light at the end of the tunnel , but we must not underestimate the problems .
our own people are struggling with a very difficult situation : they are in places where the Haitian health officials become scared by the epidemic and just leave , and they then have to handle a massive increase in cases .
Madam President , we are very pleased with the substance of this report , in which Mr Chichester gives a realistic and objective description and assessment of the problem .
then there is also private certification .
we are talking about problems that affect people most directly and , to the extent that we are able to resolve their problems , people will realise that the European Union has a function .
how can we do this ?
Parliament , through its rapporteur Mrs Guinebertière , has also shown a great deal of flexibility and a very positive approach in order to give the Fund the best possible chance of success .
at the same time , we undertook a thoroughly critical review and stated plainly where the weaknesses of the past three years have lain in order to learn from them .
I feel that the successful outcome of the conciliation procedure proves that where there is a will , there is a way .
the agreement should allow us to overcome obstacles and to build an operating framework for entrepreneurs which allows more predictability , confidence and bigger trade flows .
the WHO , indeed , urges that it be used more , as the procedure reduces risks to the consumer .
I also hope that the Commissioners who have been singled out will give some explanation this evening of their role in what took place .
it has protected the Union &apos;s reputation for the quality of its food . It has kept the internal market intact by preventing individual countries from erecting national barriers .
nonetheless , there are some very positive developments worthy of note .
yet product placement of these products has been treated differently in this vote today .
Mr President , as British Conservatives , we have always opposed the Working Time Directive .
I can also tell you that , only today , I sent a letter to everyone asking them to send me female candidates for the College as well .
last May saw the launch of the first working group dedicated to governance and human rights in the context of the Cooperation Agreement with Bangladesh , with the inaugural meeting tackling a wide variety of issues , including the death penalty and the judicial system .
multiple sclerosis research should also be covered in the seventh framework directive .
we Europeans need , as the first building block in our common foreign policy , to start by together defining what our security interests are .
as I said , I shall expect a better answer than I got yesterday , which was dreadful .
this can only be taken for granted if the storing of personal data is kept to the minimum required and if data is not stored for longer than is absolutely necessary .
this is the essence of our resolution but , tomorrow , it will be the responsibility of the Council and the Commission not just not to exclude the possibility of this danger being fully prevented once and for all but to demand it .
the data may be disputed , or observations may be made on them .
meanwhile , however , the situation on the Moluccas has become far more serious .
I think that that is too long to continue being an observer and that it is now time to provide Mauritania with the opportunity to take part .
the Commission is most concerned about the recent accidents in fireworks storage and production facilities .
I personally think that the poor shape Moldova itself is in will set the tone for the election campaign , because that country ’ s development over the past year does not really instil hope .
Mr President , the Spanish state will certainly be condemned if it commits any act of torture , and proceedings have already been brought in Spain against police and authorities who used torture against members of that organisation .
I believe that due to a very constructive approach by my Parliament colleagues , Mrs Descamps and Mrs Gibault , the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport , as also the inclusive and active role played by the Luxembourg presidency , a good compromise for first reading agreement has been achieved .
is that , though , what he wanted ?
we cannot , on the one hand , impose strict fishing quotas and , on the other , not take action to prevent illegal fishing activities .
( applause )
Central to those values is a commitment to democratic and open institutions and societies governed by the rule of law within which people of all faiths and backgrounds can live , work and prosper together .
( PT ) I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou .
finally , we include the necessary inter-parliamentary cooperation between the European Parliament and the Mercosur Parliament in order to make the agreement more democratically representative and bring the sometimes excessively technical aspects of the agreement more into line with the feelings of the citizens we represent , thereby giving the agreement a greater popular dimension .
this is quite distinct from the use of trade defence instruments .
Mr President , I should like to thank Mr Soulier for his excellent report .
that brings me to a further point , applying the provisions of Amsterdam .
they only change their gradings when a disaster is apparent to all .
three of the proposals concern the safety of passengers in commercial vehicles , in particular on buses .
I would urge those who are cautious about this to give it a try .
new media cannot be wished away , however .
one can say with certainty that the material we are discussing is possibly a reaction to the past , but does not decrease the risk of future crises .
some speakers have questioned whether it is necessary or important to raise such an issue in this House ; I believe , however , that it has been very important .
however , we can see a telling example right next to us of the way the EU can mean that resources of common interest can create partnership and development .
in the first restriction by the European Court in regard to the working conditions in force in a Member State , it still seemed to be about a policy change in European law , initiated by the Court , without the support of the European legislator .
all of this needs to be reflected in the next multiannual financial framework proposal .
I believe that this is where we have to make a start .
Commissioner , I welcome the comments you made elsewhere today that 2006 will be a year of delivery for SMEs .
for that reason , Amendments Nos 14 , 17 , 18 and 27 should not be adopted .
we absolutely reject the practice that has become established in this House whereby bulky documents are debated that are not available in our national languages ; we are elected Members whose prime responsibility is to the citizens of the European Union rather than the European interests of some State or multinational .
author . - Madam President , Sri Lanka has been afflicted by internal fighting for decades .
some rethinking will be necessary for this as regards how we can actually implement it in a somewhat institutionalised way , and - let us not forget - in a way that is acceptable to the Member States .
democracy will , I hope , one day be the norm throughout the whole of Asia .
it was not easy because some Member States opposed those measures , but we took them .
it is important that the buildings which are constructed in Europe are safe for their users and that they are also safe for the builders and other employees during the construction process .
as far as the Libyan Government is concerned , its deeply shameful behaviour in the Lampedusa affair is understandable , as we expect nothing less from an undemocratic regime .
second Cox report ( A-0171 / 99 )
secondly , I entirely agree with what Mr García-Margallo ’ s report says with regard to the importance of paying more attention to the sustainability of public finances and , in particular , with regard to how to deal with the consequences of the ageing of the population .
can the Council say what impact the advocacy of this practice has had on relations between the European Union and Iran , particularly in view of the priority which the Council has repeatedly claimed it gives to human rights ?
full democracy does not appear overnight .
this Commission is concentrating its efforts on a strategy for growth and employment , and what we wanted to know was whether the proposals that were already on the table were congruent with this strategy ’ s objectives and priorities .
I share the rapporteur &apos;s concern that the Commission should examine not just the specific issue of the standard rate and other rates of value added tax ( VAT ) , but also the broader issue of a new VAT strategy , including its scope and derogations .
only by following in the footsteps of our forefathers can we be faithful to the EU &apos;s inheritance and make the inevitable inconceivable - and that is what peacemaking means .
it is my understanding , Commissioner , that current proposals , which have been made by the EU in relation to Burma are quite frankly very unlikely to have any impact whatsoever on that regime .
through the decisions subsequently made , we know that the Member States , notably through the positive decision taken at the Copenhagen Summit , are complying with their commitments regarding ten new Member States .
that has been done entirely on the basis of merit , but also by the deliberate fostering and encouragement of women to seek and obtain posts for which they are very well qualified .
( PT ) Mr President , as I have already mentioned , the Council &apos;s proposal and conclusions on Mr Barnier &apos;s report were that this could form a working basis for future decisions .
because , Madam President , speaking for myself , by the end of the week it is really unbearable .
effective prevention policies must not be overlooked either .
the Commission is not seeking an interinstitutional conflict .
it would be , for instance , very important to support the further development of academic , cultural and artistic exchanges between Europe and Iran , two ancient beacons of civilisations which have a lot to offer to each other .
secondly , tens of thousands of jobs have been destroyed with all that ensues in terms of social difficulties and misery .
Mr Wurtz , I regret that your group feels unable to sign this motion for a resolution , but you can at least vote for it .
two weeks after the world is advised of the most brutal genocide following elections in an attempt to establish the very essence of democracy which we , as Parliamentarians , above all should uphold , we are not yet in gear and not seen as relevant to the solution by any commentators .
Mr President , I am speaking for my colleague Terry Wynn on behalf of the Committee on Budgets , and as well as on my own behalf in support of my amendments .
the new directive on deliberate release of GMOs aspired to &quot; include all direct and indirect ecological aspects &quot; .
Madam Minister , Madam Commissioner , we tabled two questions to prompt this debate , which is really intended to raise another strong warning from the European Parliament about the fight against organized crime , which everyone proclaims to be a priority , yet in practice little is done and what is done is not very effective .
my next announcement is that the competent Austrian bodies have informed me that Hella Ranner will be replaced by Heinz Becker with effect from 1 April 2011 .
thank you , Madam President .
let us create that legal basis that will enable us to act much more effectively in the future .
the opening up of the market and the cooperation at a European level should be treated in the same way by both sides .
as you will have gathered , we totally oppose proposals for any moderate , calculated liberalisation of the railways because it paves the way for full liberalisation with all the adverse consequences that will have on the travelling public .
these have had their first experiences of rapid economic growth which was then slowed by the crisis , and now they see that they have an opportunity to leave this crisis behind .
the ACP countries , which already enjoy preferential access to the EU market , have expressed their concerns that the reforms will hinder and not help their economies .
Mr President , on behalf of the Spanish Socialists , I want to express my condolences to Mr Pomés Ruiz for the murder of a fellow politician , and join in with the condemnation of this vile attack and the murder of the civil guard , Mr Parada .
however , it would appear important to emphasise that it is neither acceptable nor effective to imagine that terrorist violence can be curbed by reducing the significance of some of the most important victories of the European democracies and the Union such as respect for individual freedoms , citizens &apos; equality before the law and parliamentary control at European as well as national level of all decisions on this matter .
one is the reference made by Amendment No 23 , unlike the Regulation , which does not allude to it at all , to a counterfeit currency database .
as my fellow-Members have spoken about this Centre in great detail , I have to say what I would have liked to have seen .
( NL ) The EU and its forerunners have been born from the desire on the part of major international businesses for one unfettered market with a common currency .
perhaps I am being too demanding , though .
in Poland , where production quotas are allocated to sugar factories and not to farmers who grow sugar beet , this could lead to the reduction of sugar production , forcing farmers to stop growing sugar beet .
the proposals for Regulations relating to the introduction of the euro give rise to two kinds of manipulation - one , alas , is all too common while the other is novel and outrageous .
this initiative updates and relaunches the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations in 2000 .
however , if Russia is to be a Member of the WTO it must respect WTO regulations , in particular counterfeiting and piracy of goods must be stamped out .
subject : Uniform electoral procedure for elections to the European Parliament
frankly , the Council also has a responsibility here , given that it will have to endorse the Partnership Agreement at the end of the process .
now that , for the first time , the Member States of the European Union are going to meet to define a common strategy with regard to employment , we should remember that the audiovisual market is expanding rapidly .
when Mr Rothley says jobs are at stake , that is nothing but polemics .
both sides emphasised the importance of taking account of the fact that relations between the EU and the countries concerned vary in character and are at different levels of political and economic development .
( the House rose and observed a minute &apos;s silence )
in its earlier resolutions , the European Parliament has rightly urged that Europe should make the effort not just to support democracy but also to ensure that a political solution and negotiations can be achieved , but not that more powerful weapons should be delivered allowing even greater repression . This contravenes the European code of conduct itself .
first of all , Member States have to step up national implementation of EU legislation .
indeed , it has a natural ability to withstand globalisation and , consequently , to sustain employment and ensure its fair distribution throughout Europe .
we can always carry on talking .
you can use nuclear energy , and the Euratom Treaty allows large amounts of money for the safe use of nuclear energy .
this statement , Mr President , Commissioners , even provides for - and I find this most surprising - an exception to be made to the application of our legislation in light of the United States &apos; wishes .
we must particularly encourage the Member States and their regions located on the EU &apos;s external borders to create direct links over the border to Russia .
many advertisements attempt to manipulate vulnerable target audiences , such as children and severely indebted persons .
– As the Council still cannot attend , I propose to amend the agenda slightly and the next item is the oral question ( B5-0278 / 2003 ) , by Klaus-Heiner Lehne and others on behalf of the PPE-DE Group , on market regulations and competition rules for the liberal professions .
Mr President , I pay tribute to the very welcome initiative taken by the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights in producing this report in favour of providing decent social protection for assisting spouses .
it is fair to say that initially the administration was opposed to this legislation but in the end , as a result in particular , as far as Cuba was concerned , of events involving the shooting down of planes by the Cuban Government , President Clinton signed both laws .
Mr President , here we are on the eve of a new round of reforms and the umpteenth Intergovernmental Conference .
and , of course , without it we would not have been in a position to embrace and support the Europeans who have suffered half a century of totalitarian oppression .
however , that has more to do with technical development and increases in efficiency than with the process of deregulation .
these include our efforts to promote peace and reconstruction in various places , including Northern Ireland .
( 1 )
that is a minimum .
I therefore welcome the adoption of this resolution , and I hope that there will be a significant strengthening of SME finance schemes and a simplification of administrative procedures , specifically by reducing the number of programmes , and by making national and EU programmes complement each other better .
our objective is to reach a compromise at first reading , which is what is wanted by most of the associations of patients whose lives , in many cases , depend on a leading edge medicinal product .
Mr President , Mr Nicolaï , Commissioner , at the EU summit in November the German Chancellor will put forward proposals for the full liberalisation of the EU energy market by 2007 , as well as for the creation of a European system for monitoring financial markets and for the harmonisation of the principles of financial transactions in the 25 Member States .
the Danish people are not being asked .
now it is my colleague Mr Coelho ’ s turn to speak .
now , however , the classifications of substances reflect their actual potential danger as well as can be expected .
I wish that those in this House who have doubts would recognize the importance of that point .
( FR ) Mr President , regarding safety , I am , of course , only too happy to support all the proposals made by my fellow Members on the essential independence of those who will be responsible for carrying out the stress tests and the idea that these rules will be set at Community level .
globalised politics presupposes that national politics and interests founded on the sovereignty of the nation state should be bound to the global politics of common responsibility .
we shall endeavour to do so .
not only have we waited too long , but also the crises that we are currently experiencing are , once again , turning the spotlight on the limitations of the policy , which have been evident for years .
Nepal is very high up and helping this country where needs are very great must also be high up on our list .
thirdly , a precautionary period should be established for migration which , if necessary , could be extended through comitology .
the issue today is that war is being provoked under the mantle of peacekeeping , and we are perilously close to that war .
I strongly hope that , by the end of the week , Captain Blair will have avoided the iceberg and steered the British Presidency to a safe harbour and a secure financial future for the European Union .
I am sure that our cooperation with the rapporteurs on those two programmes , Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz and Mr Robles Piquer , will be just as constructive as the cooperation we have had on the programmes we have been talking about today .
let us help entrepreneurs by providing them with information and assistance so that they , like the big concerns , are able to have access to the aid that the Union makes available .
the international community is there .
the rapporteur is to be congratulated on the progress made .
education must not disregard the labour market .
Mr President , I would like to make a short statement - which I had intended to make yesterday - about events yesterday at Charles de Gaulle Airport .
Russia still has to put her house in order .
it is therefore clear that the job must be a quality job with decent pay and conditions if it is to have an impact on resolving the issue of poverty .
Madam President , I voted in this report in order to help Member States and I therefore pick out these bits : Amendment 46 , split vote - Member States &apos; own laws may not be waived .
the countries of Central and Eastern Europe have taken up loans granted by the IMF , the World Bank and the European Union in an attempt to overcome their domestic problems .
I believe that if we do not offer alternatives to our young people , not enough dreams , not enough adventure , and not enough certainty , then drugs and drug dealers still have a bright future ahead of them .
at no point in this debate , however , must it be forgotten that the EU is the most open trading area in the world and that the Europeans also have legitimate interests to safeguard .
in relation to the tragic events that occurred in Yerevan on 1 March in the aftermath of the election , the Commission shares the general concern over the violent clashes between police and opposition demonstrators , which resulted in a number of deaths .
the Commission welcomes the convergence being developed between Parliament and the Presidency and will work to facilitate the achievement of an agreement on REACH , so that REACH becomes law as quickly as possible .
in a few weeks , I will let you know what I am going to do in that regard and I will tell you whether or not we need to regulate .
we have 62 priorities in this splendid new document .
the Levi Strauss management engaged last week in discussions with worker representatives , both at national and European level , and worker representatives are apparently now preparing proposals with a view to finding alternative solutions to the closure or to the dismissal of the workers likely to be affected .
this is a crucial point given that in Europe there are 18 million businesses employing fewer than 10 people .
we should ensure sound development of environmental technologies , make environmental investments tax deductible , promote research , and develop environmentally friendly production technologies .
the final proposal acknowledges the key role that the public sector can play in this area , for example by setting up energy efficiency pilot projects , awarding public contracts , establishing energy efficiency criteria and , in its investments , offering incentives for meeting energy efficiency improvement targets .
structural weaknesses still remain , however , which only a coordinated medium and long-term strategy , with the active participation of the social partners , will enable us to overcome .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
the latest example was seen as recently as last Monday .
these led us to pay close attention to the simplification of procedures , to the reduction of red tape , and to customer-friendly access to European support grants .
the European Union has also provided Bangladesh with a considerable amount of external aid that has been earmarked for it and on which , in fact , the country is heavily dependent .
I voted in favour of the proposal for a directive as regards information to the general public on medicinal products for human use subject to medical prescription because I believe that harmonising the laws in this sector is a fundamental means of safeguarding the knowledge of European patients .
Mr Rehder calls into question many important points and we can quite readily take them on board this evening .
since these are border regions , there towards the Aegean , towards Evros and Turkey , they also fail to attract investment because everyone is uneasy about stability in those areas because of the notorious policy of the Turkish leadership .
this needs the financial support we are giving .
indeed , the passage from non-harmonisation to complete harmonisation , if it is to take place at all , can only be achieved in stages ; and the proposal on the standard rate falls within this context .
and that analysis showed that , because of the theoretical basis of certain calculations put before it , the production from underground seams envisaged in the said agreements for 2001 would not in reality be reduced by the amount estimated .
it will be up to the presidency to ensure that we will also be able to applaud its actions .
so I call on you to inform the Member States that the marketing ban - and please note that it is an absolute one - has been in force since 30 June 2002 , and that the Member States would be well advised to be rather more amenable , rather more flexible and a bit less obstinate in the conciliation procedure .
the possibilities are there .
at the same time , there is an ethnic discrimination of sorts within extreme poverty , and we must therefore pay special attention to the Roma when providing opportunities .
it goes without saying that the principle of equal treatment of persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin should be applied .
last week , in the light of these facts , the Commission handed over the findings to the relevant legal authorities in the Member State concerned .
if we want to ensure that corporate social responsibility continues into the 21st century there needs to be dialogue with the whole community , and for this reason in December we held a multi-stakeholder forum on corporate social responsibility .
that is the European Union ’ s achievement .
one chink in the Commission &apos; s armour at European level was that of milk replacer and the fat contaminated with protein residue .
the very last thing that it would be in our common interest to do would be to seek to influence the WTO &apos;s final ruling in any way .
put the obstruction of freedom of religion and the gross violations of human rights in China at the top of the agenda .
I therefore foresee major problems when , after a few years , the financial balance sheet is drawn up .
we have waited in vain for this invitation , which should actually have come at the last part-session .
so it is no good for blithe spirits in Berlin to whistle that other U2 hit &apos; With or without you &apos; , or for people in Paris to push Ireland into voting again .
these are areas which , from the outset , medicinal products were intended to safeguard .
these are the issues we must continue to deal with within our current debates .
I have been indicating for quite some time - well before many people who have already spoken - that I want to make a point of order .
finally , the trend during the past decade to lighten the burden on mobile factors at the cost of the less mobile labour factor could not be reversed , despite any number of employment debates .
in short , this is the whole problem , from PHARE through TACIS to the Structural Funds , since when I look at Agenda 2000 once again , I can see that the Commission is putting more and more emphasis on decentralized implementation .
this issue has not been resolved at all .
such cooperation is and remains contrary to European standards on the protection of privacy .
in each case we can report striking progress , even though in some areas , for example the issue of international adoption , very intensive discussions are still continuing .
that of course we can do .
there is , however , a legal problem with this type of authority since it could supplant a national court system and would ultimately become an interpreter of Community law .
there is an internal Council document which was to be discussed .
that is why my group , the National Alliance or the Union for Europe of the Nations Group , abstained from voting on this report .
in addition , the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 8 . We do agree that Internet advertisements should be covered by the term &apos; promotional literature &apos; , but it must be up to the Member States to decide whether an Internet advertisement is considered to be an advertisement on their territory .
it is quite impudent !
some of you said that there will be a &apos; President of Europe &apos; .
we are also disappointed by other aspects of the Commission proposal .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , allow me first to express my heartfelt thanks to the rapporteur , Mrs Pack , and indeed to Parliament as a whole .
Mr President , like many here I welcome the report and congratulate the rapporteur on the work he has done so far .
on the other hand , I am opposed to ideas of harmonising consumer protection in the EU and appealing to more countries to adopt the euro .
with regard to the regularisation programme implemented by the Spanish Government and referred to in the question , this was discussed informally by the Council at its meeting in January 2005 .
we also share this objective and feel , as you do , that rapid economic change and the effects of globalisation must be managed .
so I must say to you that the method you are using is intensifying the debate in this House .
consequently , I wish to propose to my fellow Members that we stick with the package supported by the Committee on Transport and Tourism .
a Europe that is open to dialogue but adheres firmly to the principles of a civilised and responsible international community will find allies among the public opinion of the five continents and even in the US Congress and among a number of states .
what we really need to do here , therefore , is define what these terms actually mean , which is not happening today .
unfortunately , we missed the deadline for tabling normal amendments .
we at the Committee on Development and Cooperation have every confidence that we can bring about this reform thanks to the agreements we have reached with the Commission .
( NL ) Tomorrow , the European Parliament will be voting on the abolition of the short-stay visa requirement for Balkan countries .
computers have been confiscated with a complete disregard for legal guidelines and without any expert record made of the data currently stored , allowing the authorities to falsify evidence and settle scores again with political opponents .
there are those who stand to gain if the talks do not succeed .
the vote will therefore take place after the vote on the Langenhagen report .
the latter and his immediate entourage attempted to conceal their involvement in the grim liquidations of 1998 with utterly vile lies about a Jewish-American plot against the fatherland .
cohesion also includes economic and social cohesion .
we are the body with the political competence to take into account the substantial and professional work of the Court of Auditors .
this year &apos;s budget debate looks set to become something of a battle between the Council and the Commission .
we should expand the concept of European solidarity .
once this study has been carried out and the Commission has issued a decision through the codecision procedure , the Ecolabel logo can be awarded to products with the best environmental performance .
a 25 member Commission does not necessarily spell trouble .
the skippers and crews , who have often mortgaged their homes to raise the cash to build these boats , will lose not only their jobs and boats but also their homes .
there must be no repeats of last Monday &apos;s accident .
the crisis is far from over .
I believe that these actual benefits , not to mention the potential benefits , substantially outweigh any risks .
at the last session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva , the European Union took the initiative of tabling a resolution on the human rights situation in the Islamic Republic of Iran .
exchanging information is no longer enough .
it is true that you have made a number of commitments , but one of them was to take the moratorium to the United Nations , whereas we were told yesterday that no such thing is going to happen .
therefore , I would ask your departments to investigate what they can do to encourage the take-up of such schemes across the European Union .
the general conclusion of the opinion is that the risk assessment is insufficient due to the limited data available .
sound environmental choices , stoutly defended by the Swedish Association for the Protection of the Environment , have led to our having , I believe , absolutely the safest detergents now being bought and sold in the world .
the emphasis upon the knowledge - or information - society in this programme , as in the different national programmes of which we are aware , does in fact lead to a concentration upon innovators , entrepreneurs , new companies and new industries .
this is probably not the most appropriate point in history to issue regulations of this complexity .
we can merely shout in rage against this form of brutality , this form of inhumanity .
( EL ) Mr President , the problem of illegal immigration in Greece is far worse than in the rest of the European Union , as we all know .
furthermore , even though it is the moment for making savings , the number of foreign representatives from the EU is growing at an impressive rate , without Parliament being informed as to the relevance of those appointments .
so it is emphatically not a matter of one or other but of all .
one of the mainstays of REACH is the reversal of the burden of proof , yet there are those in this House who even want to do away with this idea .
it is not clear whether the action programme supports a liberal or a restrictive drug policy.-The aim is to &apos; coordinate the policies of Member States &apos; ( Article 1 ) .
failure to do so , or to act appropriately , risks negative effects on long-term development .
– Mr President , over the next five years , the European Union needs to strengthen its institutional and democratic functions .
and let us imagine that money is circulating there , and weapons .
in the light of global competition and given the impact of air transport on the life of European citizens , the Commission believes that it is necessary to improve the efficiency of aeronautical research through greater coordination and integration of the activities undertaken at all levels , i.e. national , European and private , into a single vision .
cooperation between organisations such as the WHO , the FAO , the World Bank and leading poultry producers in the USA , Brazil and the European Union is now essential in order to eradicate these hotbeds .
I understand that other European regions possibly have the same problem as well and the situation is not any better ( is it ? ) , but today I am talking about my region and therefore in this case , we would like to have the opportunity to reach Western and Central Europe through Poland , once Poland has joined our rail track .
in our view , the subsidiarity principle should be taken seriously in EU development policy .
we have very scarce resources and the problems continue to grow .
certainly if we do nothing , the forebodings contained in the report may yet come to pass , although some Member States are reacting and putting in place measures to support men , women and children and that is positive .
Europe and Russia are , in fact , interdependent , both economically and politically .
the translation of the aid programme into practical measures remains our common priority .
is it democratic and fair for us to accept that countries in the first category can possess nuclear weapons but for us to control countries in the second category that wish to acquire them ?
in Amendment No 12 , we prefer to retain the flexibility of the references to services .
I considered the composition of the management authority and management administration to be very important , and Parliament really has been given a role of political control here , which I feel is a very important step forward so that the Member States do not send to the administration whatever and whoever they want .
when it comes to the adventitious and technically unavoidable presence of GMOs in non-genetically-modified products , we need rules that work in practice .
a clear declaration on feedingstuffs will allow double freedom of choice , both for the party using the feedingstuff and the subsequent consumer .
the Lisbon Treaty gives us instruments to pursue the goals that are important to our future , and to implement rapidly the reforms we need for that purpose .
there was a problem with the waste , and the joke was that the solution was to package the waste up and send it to the main post office , where it would go round and round in an eternal cycle until the radiation had diminished .
we held the debate about Georgia yesterday and we have drawn up a resolution , so we do not need to reiterate everything today .
Roman law at the time of Justinian stated that it was better for a guilty person to go unpunished than for an innocent person to be deprived of their life .
the present European agricultural policy is no longer appropriate to our times .
if we want to continue with nuclear energy , that can only be the highest standard technically possible , but I really want to use this as an opportunity to say one thing : we must not be unreasonable in asking from the candidate countries what we do not ask of ourselves .
Mr President , allow me to reply to some of the points that have been raised .
as far as Turkey is concerned , regularisation of its relations with the Republic of Cyprus and a halt to overflights over Greek territory by its military aircraft are two important factors in speeding up its progress towards accession .
when we have accepted the 12 new countries which now want to join , we will number almost half a million people .
a planned total of EUR 2.7 billion in public funding is to be allocated to measures in the three regions in question , with EUR 2 billion , or 75 % , being provided under the Structural Funds .
the EGF is aimed at helping workers who are victims of the relocation of companies , and it is fundamental in helping them have access to new employment in the future .
Klironomos report
I give the floor to Mr Bangemann , on behalf of the Commission .
( PL ) Madam Commissioner , you are well known as someone who is always fighting to reduce production costs in agriculture .
things are happening fast , in fact they are happening at the speed of light , which is why my group is delighted with the communication from the Commission and with Mr Veltroni &apos; s exhaustive report , which looks into every aspect of these new developments .
in Europe , we have the strictest animal welfare and hygiene regulations in the world .
Why , &apos; wonders the paper , &apos; is there not the same determination to fight real crime in vast areas of the country ?
on the issue of the amendments to the draft European Regional Development Fund Regulation tabled by Mrs Schroedter , three relate to the recitals and one to the substance .
in writing . - I voted for this report , which examines a Commission proposal to extend by 5 years to 31 December 2015 the requirement for EU countries to have a minimum standard VAT rate of 15 % .
the European Parliament voted by a 95 % majority for Europe to ratify the Kyoto Protocol , even without the United States .
how is the fund to be made up ?
it is also stated in the German media that you are to meet a certain Member this week and that the Member in question will then hand over certain lists to you .
our common aim is peace , cooperation and resolution of the problems facing people who live in the here and now .
the joint declaration calling for the simplification and a more targeted use of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund to help overcome the effects of the economic crisis should also be welcomed .
the Commission &apos; s communication on a Community immigration policy , and the vote on the Pirker report , give us an opportunity to do just that .
we must work together to reduce bureaucracy .
in listening to your answer , President-in-Office , I would remind you that in too many cases that trade is linked to human rights abuses in the form of the involuntary removal of organs from prisoners due for execution in China .
please allow me , by way of conclusion , to again ask the Commissioner when and how she plans to actually submit her actual proposal for the trading of quotas in the Member States .
to achieve this , I believe we must all be clear about our immigration policy , which is not currently the case .
I have not voted in favour of the Wortmann-Kool report either - I have voted against it - because it does not take into account the Stability and Growth Pact , the European Employment Strategy or the Europe 2020 strategy objectives , which are a source of hope for millions of Europeans , particularly the young .
most of my amendments have been voted for but , unfortunately , that which asked for our withdrawal from the OECD agreement , was defeated by a right wing which is slavishly devoted to the United States ( which has not ratified it in any case ) .
in my view at the moment it is far too prone to technical logjams stopping political initiatives .
we should be reinforcing transatlantic solidarity , developing our joint capacities to tackle terrorism , to deal with the WMD threat and to deploy capable military forces wherever they might be needed .
the same is true for the Christian minority in the plain of Nineveh .
the Commission is ready to discuss all these issues .
but we live in democratic countries with democratic institutions like this Parliament .
we might disagree with the advice and the direction they will suggest but we will not have the right to be there at the macroeconomic dialogue to say so .
( the President cut off the speaker )
the Peace Implementation Council has recognized and supported the existing understanding to continue the military presence after 1998 .
we have always said that the dialogues should address the core issues , such as the preservation of Tibet &apos;s unique culture , religion and traditions as well as the need to achieve a system of meaningful autonomy for Tibet within a Chinese constitution .
this initiative forms part of the Lisbon Strategy objectives of investing in growth and employment , and is to be funded by the new generation of Community programmes ( 2007-2013 ) , such as the European Social Fund , of which lifelong learning is one of the priorities .
in writing . - ( NL ) I have voted in favour of this resolution .
I am not hiding in any way .
at the same time , the task is getting tougher : we have an ageing population , a growing productivity gap with our competitors , and failings in education and research .
these are something that Europe provides all too often .
Madam President , Slovenia is operating a nuclear power station near the Austrian border .
the Member States must define common penalties and adopt a consistent overall policy .
how can we forget that after the summer 2003 heat wave more than 70 000 additional deaths were recorded in some ten European countries ?
the reflection group which carried out the preparatory work for the Intergovernmental Conference included it amongst the institutional reform issues on which the Intergovernmental Conference could and should intervene , without going any further .
written Statements ( Rule 142 )
the discussions were extremely thorough and it was only yesterday , at 8 p.m. , that I received Mrs Palacio &apos; s letter informing me of the committee &apos; s opinion on this issue .
we in the Freedom Party have always declared our opposition to the transportation of live animals , especially to countries far beyond the frontiers of the EU , because of the intolerable suffering it involves for the animals , and so we regard it as our duty to demand the deletion of this passage from the Commission proposal , a point on which , unfortunately , no comment is made in Mr Alavanos &apos;s report .
( DE ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I believe we should carry out these evaluations from time to time , and in particular publish the findings from the Member States in a register , as conflicts do occur on the individual issues , of course , over the years , for example in the case of the Water Framework Directive , where we are going to great lengths on the one hand to promote renewable energy , but on the other hand are wasting unused water .
what is the main purpose here ?
Madam President , it is very necessary to combat racism .
cannabis is legal already in Holland and there is a drive to legalize it from some Member States in the European Union which will only increase pressures .
ladies and gentlemen , technology has rebelled against us .
today is the anniversary of the birth of Alexander Hamilton , one of the fathers of the American Constitution , whose picture can today be found on ten-dollar notes .
Mrs Schierhuber has produced an extremely good report , and I would like to thank her sincerely for that .
I would tell Mr Bertens that when we refer to assessing a policy it has to be examined as a whole .
unfortunately , you have got one minute and thirty seconds .
it is an excellent idea to set up the European Research Council and to facilitate the movement of researchers within the EU .
that crisis is enormous .
why then , cannot Mrs Fouque &apos;s vote be accepted today ?
so much for setting a civilised example , Chancellor Schröder !
Mr President , the priority given to financial and monetary criteria reinforces the increase in inequalities of every shape and form .
too much legislation will lead to rigidity in the system .
even in cases where customers read all the contractual clauses and state that they disagree with one of them , they do not have any negotiating power .
on these two issues , unfortunately , the Commission has not so far taken a clear stand .
as the parent of a diabetic daughter , can I support the honourable Member in her plea for Commission action and particularly congratulate her on the initiative that she and Mr Bovis are taking to bring this to the attention of Parliament .
I agree that we must be very careful about any potential health risks , although if there are health risks then this product should not be on the market at all in the Community .
they can help initiate the process but longer-term industrial cooperation based on investment and shared interests will probably be the only way to secure in depth the necessary transfer of competence .
terrorism also features regularly during meetings with our partners and in international organisations .
as you know , ladies and gentlemen , I do not think that we are wasting time because I think that democracy at European level can be free of the violence that it sometimes has at national level .
on the whole , it is true that we should aspire to a common entry policy and , more generally , a common immigration policy within the European Union .
we should not , then deny access to the road to Europe to governments like that – Turkey ’ s in particular – or to a society like that , for if it turns out to be possible for our values to put down roots in an Islamic society , it demolishes the Islamists ’ thesis that such a thing is impossible .
talk of stopping , for example , Chinese textile exports has been heard in this House in the course of this evening .
the Commission &apos;s policy on abortion is clear .
but I have to say that never has it been more important to ensure a level playing field throughout the Member States , and we cannot allow different levels of percentages among the Member States .
catching up with the United States or Japan still remains an ambition , a dream .
I am very glad to see that this is a shared opinion and goal not only in this House but also in the three institutions , and that is a guarantee of success .
we support the Spanish Government and security forces in their tough stance against ETA terrorism and express solidarity with the Spanish people and in particular , those that have suffered directly as victims of terrorism .
I understand that some commissioners , Mrs Reding and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner , for example , have shown an interest in this .
Commissioner , just guess how much money she got from the Austrian machine - she got exactly half , just 50 % !
I should like to prevent that from happening and that is why we must try to achieve better coordination at European level .
that is a step in the right direction .
we have always considered the election of the President of the European Parliament to be a political act of some significance and , as such , an opportunity not to blur the political differences between us but , on the contrary , to affirm them loud and clear , at least in the first round if there are also to be others .
the debate is not being conducted in a very level-headed way .
what steps has the European Union taken with regard to the persecution of Christians in a State with which we have close links ?
and yet , we have a deficit of fisheries products .
. – Mr President , I should like to start by congratulating our rapporteur , Mr Buzek , on his excellent work .
I am aware of the responsibilities of the Delors Commission , but those of the present Commission are overwhelming , because Mr Santer and his colleagues &apos; knew &apos; for two years !
firstly , the European Union is responding to a specific request from the United Nations .
Madam President , it is quite clear that there is a consensus emerging in the Chamber , which gives me no pleasure , and that is the criticism of the Presidency .
finally , the draftsman would like to keep the legislative procedure for the decision on other communication and information exchange systems , including the mandatory opinion of the Court of Auditors , rather than apply the &apos; comitology &apos; procedure .
today , there is extremely broad penetration on the market of environmental labels , images and texts which may be confusing to consumers , from pictures of forests on tins containing hazardous substances to claims for foods with a neutral carbon footprint and even ecological cars .
I think that this evening in this plenary debate we are also making a contribution to doing this , and I think and hope that good progress will be made so that we will have a second directive to combat money laundering in the European Union very soon , which will then I hope also be swiftly implemented by the Member States !
it is even more galling when we think that this was supposed to be the great year of advance for Europe .
what measures will it take to ensure that this kind of situation does not happen again ?
the question remains open , because the problem is complex .
Parliament has done some good work to increase the number of acts that support sustainable development in legislation regulating production .
this decision was made by agreement with the interested parties and with the unanimous consent of all participants and all Member States .
the next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in China after the earthquake and before the Olympic Games .
of course , this situation also has serious consequences for the average consumer .
I am very grateful to Neil Parish for having put this oral question to the Commission .
firstly , they simply do not address the seriousness of the severe unemployment and social crisis that we are facing and which will worsen in the months if not years to come .
virtually every legislative proposal from the European Commission will be examined by national parliaments in order to confirm compliance with the principle of subsidiarity .
Member of the Commission . - We have a range of tools available to us for late transposition of directives , which primarily the EU scoreboard deals with .
what is the situation within the EU ?
that is perhaps not the case now , but it is other parts of television &apos; s distribution network which will become bottlenecks or gatekeepers if we do not watch out .
we have been through a tough period , but I can assure you that there is nothing unrealistic in this goal .
the results of the mission will be debated shortly both by the European Union and by the OSCE in Vienna .
President-in-Office of the Council , I wish you every success .
the report is making a step in the wrong direction .
regrettably , Mr Pimenta cannot be here .
Parliament cannot and should not take a decision if it does not have access to all relevant information and documents .
we need to talk about those issues .
other questions , such as the status of end of waste and the recovery of waste , seem to me to have been sacrificed in the name of an agreement at second reading .
will they be taken into account to avoid the application of the double jeopardy rule , in order to avoid unfair double convictions ?
the Irish authorities estimate the total direct damage caused by the disaster at EUR 520.9 million .
now , the violence in the north , as well as in the cocoa belt , and the abuses by the so-called patriotic forces are leading to ever-increasing human rights violations .
the Right has a problem : it is characterised by authoritarianism , a moralistic approach , and neo-liberalism .
I hope that this addition can be adopted by the Commission .
secondly , sport helps us appreciate activities in forma pauperis which involve minority groups that deserve more support , also at European level .
existing plant are to be included on a progressive basis .
Britain has made phenomenal strides in recycling over the last ten years , but most of that has come from the business cycle , now we have to move to the domestic waste stream .
in the case of Turkey , the pre-accession assistance is not only benefiting a non-European country , but is also , in some cases , disappearing into the pockets of corrupt officials .
for next year , the situation of categories 3 , 4 and 5 is very worrying ; we have already mentioned it : we are very close to the upper limit and in category 5 we are really above it .
the report has my support , as it is important that a standard of protection be introduced for refugees and that all Member States show solidarity in shouldering their responsibility and cooperating purposefully .
in any event , Mr President , the clock must not be turned back to a veto .
Mr President , we are on the home straight with a report , a Commission initiative which Parliament warmly welcomed and which we feel is one of the most important aspects of the work which the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism has carried out in recent years : a single European sky , with efficiency , safety and cost containment as its objectives .
any member of the House of Commons or House of Lords that votes for ratification of the Reform Treaty is therefore , literally , a traitor to their country .
the Union takes on more and more external commitments , often without consulting this House .
we think that providing passengers with information is fundamental .
we are still negotiating but we have high hopes of a positive conclusion .
that means that the here the Community has not followed the path of a certain general harmonization , but has moved into substantive Community law .
it waves the flag of competition and the four freedoms which accommodate big business .
( applause )
that a Member State wishes to maintain its sovereignty in this area is not an obstacle to there being a Union policy that sets some priorities , nor does it prevent these policies being reflected in European Refugee Fund ( ERF ) grants .
independence is in the Treaty and is the absolute key for credibility .
the climate debate became a debate about fairness and , even in the preparatory conference , the emerging economies made it clear that they had no intention of making concessions in Cancún .
our Amendment No 51 calls for further derogations from the notification procedure in order to avoid unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles hampering trade in GMOs .
I believe it should be dealt with instead as an idea that is still at the general stage .
that is a useful outcome of this exercise .
8 . Free Trade Agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council ( vote )
there is detailed case law from the Court in Strasbourg .
so they cannot be permanent support schemes .
I should prefer to focus on the possibility of using biotechnology to design new pesticides and chemicals which work where they have to work and are broken down when they have to be broken down .
the failure of the multilateral negotiations and , by extension , the return to bilateral regional agreements could lead to an unequal process of liberalisation , uneven development and uncontrolled trade disputes .
in other words , in addition to economic issues , consideration also has to be given to political , cultural and social aspects , and also to the right to privacy and to consumer protection .
it is not a question of whether or not it reflected the committee &apos; s opinion : reflecting an opinion is not the same as being an actual opinion .
Mexico is another case in relation to which we must insist , on the basis of the association agreement with that country , that the Mexican authorities tackle violence against women with greater determination and political will .
at the same time , Mr Bush himself is making headlines on the continuing campaign against Cuba , with his well publicised message on 20 May , while the United States of America are jamming the country &apos;s radio and television network in order to broadcast their cheap propaganda .
what you perhaps consider worrying , what you will read , is not a Parliamentary decision ; it is the model decision that is part of the interinstitutional agreement , already published - with the identical wording - in the Official Journal of 31 May last year .
however , we must not rush into this , as we might throw out the baby with the bathwater .
in short , here we have a simple , innovative , democratic procedure .
the resolution tabled in the European Parliament on nuclear safety fifteen years after Chernobyl highlights the gravity of this major accident and its consequences for health and the environment .
first of all , in response to Mrs Doyle , the situation , as you will appreciate , is evolving hour by hour but I can confirm that , as we speak , there is no confirmation of the situation in Armagh about which you asked me .
we must be aware that the discharge procedure is a specific task , carried out within a limited timescale - it is a financial task , which has well defined scope , we can grant the discharge or we can postpone it , but we can never reject it outright , because that would require upsetting the sequence of balances .
some of us might have wanted to go one step further , or take one step less , but it is nevertheless going in the right direction .
unfortunately , neither the Commission nor MEPs are suggesting that Member States embark on tax cuts or fundamental corrections that might bring about transparency in tax jurisdictions .
although we must be strict in combating corruption - and the Commission &apos;s reports emphasise how serious these problems still are in many of the candidate countries - some of us would like to see a degree of flexibility in the assessment of this state aid , along the lines of the attitude of the European Union during German reunification , when it seems that we adopted a particular attitude towards the new , reunified Länder .
Mr President , I would like firstly to express my agreement with Chairman Wynn &apos; s words on the timely nature of this debate .
I would therefore also like to make it clear at the outset that it was not easy to find a common line within our Group .
what the President-in-Office of the Council said here today in fact backs up this scepticism , for he said that far more comprehensive reforms will have to be undertaken .
we must now support the pro-European forces within the country whose hopes we have raised , who want a change of government and who have cast their votes . They see the future of their country as being in the EU and not in a closer relationship with Russia .
it is a goal for all institutions and bodies in the EU to have increased openness , not least so that irregularities are prevented .
the free recovery system , for example , for old vehicles and raising the percentage to be recycled will increase recycling activities and the number of jobs this generates accordingly .
Mr President , Commissioner Diamantopoulou , Mr Katiforis , well done on this initiative , well done on the content of this report .
Madam President , the course taken by the G8 in Genoa provides food for thought for the governments , particularly the governments of the eight protagonist countries , but also for the Commission and the Council , the institutions , the parties and the movement in which an interesting debate has been opened on the very definition of &quot; no to globalisation &quot; .
it is not a faith .
since the numbers of people affected by asbestos are predicted to rise considerably by 2020 , legislation must be upgraded to further reduce acceptable levels of exposure .
- what percentage of the total number of workers does this number represent ?
we recently adopted an energy strategy for Europe up to 2020 .
the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs requests this quite expressly .
he founded new monasteries and championed the social well-being of the public .
Madam President , thank you for the report .
it is true that the document and proposals for the Regulation head in the right direction , but I think that they have fallen far short of our expectations .
( Loud applause ) Ladies and Gentlemen , thank you , from the bottom of my heart .
but this is not a question of health or environmental protection .
we must remember that the Member States , including those which have published letters , agreed to the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy .
the enlargement of the EU to include new Member States has meant drawing up a new policy on tourism to meet current and future requirements .
I would therefore like to end , Mr President , by expressing my satisfaction with this achievement .
the top line is good news : prices are improving .
following the recent UN Security Council refusal to apply sanctions against Burma , disgracefully , the UN Human Rights Council has focused almost entirely and exclusively on one single country - Israel - totally ignoring Burma .
this may come as a surprise to you , because as everyone knows and as probably many people will say , the Court of Auditors has not issued a Statement of Assurance about the Commission ’ s conduct of policy for 11 years in a row .
as we know relatively little about this period , I propose that this Parliament should set up a group to look into the region and comprehensively document the past three decades in that country .
we must demand that all the governments concerned do what is necessary to prevent these attacks , and when that is not possible , to arrest and punish those responsible .
it is sometimes difficult to get up-to-date with what is happening in women &apos;s sport at the highest level .
we must not forget that those who suffer most from disasters , natural or man-made , are those who are already in fragile situations due to poverty .
the utopia of Jean Monnet has given way to an area of widespread rivalries , a gigantic poker game in which the stake is European hegemony .
I am also very pleased with the statement that the Commissioner has made here , which has filled us with hope .
a distinguishing feature , if not the distinguishing feature , of European agriculture , is its multi-functionality , as stated in the report .
- ( SK ) The Catania report covers many human rights issues .
we must confront this problem vigorously and I also wish to ask Commissioner Loyola de Palácio whether she still intends to table legislation in this field by the end of the year , and , if so , what will it be ?
there is also another legal instrument in the form of the computerised reservation system regulation .
so , personally , as far as the euro goes , I am in favour .
therefore , I voted &apos; for &apos; .
I am a great supporter of President Barroso &apos;s plan with regard to the necessity for Europe to take the lead and take the leap from the 20th century into the 22nd century with regard to what we need to do for research and development and investment in technology .
if the European Parliament makes frequent use of its new initiative it must in the long term strengthen its influence on the European Union &apos;s legislative system .
I would give the same answer .
I believe that it would be far more efficient to restructure the existing agencies , including those agencies that deal directly with issues related to mental health .
the third reason , and perhaps the most important , is that the Directive will now also prohibit the financing of terrorism .
the European Union will change qualitatively , and not just quantitatively after each individual accession .
the fact that there is a possible cross-subsidisation in favour of rail transport is an aspect which is perfectly defensible .
we face the most horrifying scenario of losing the Suez Canal .
one might also wonder what purpose the CFSP serves , since it has proved incapable of providing the basis for any joint action to speak of in this area , which is so import for the future of the European Union .
he is confident that at the third stage we will start with a sufficient number of Member States .
( HU ) Fellow Members , allow me to congratulate the rapporteur and all those who have helped and perfected his work with their questions and their support over the past years .
their role is often undervalued and they are also thwarted at times by the institutional authorities .
we must not bury our heads in the sand but endeavour to pay off the debts we have incurred with the elderly people of today .
from this point of view , the draft budget for the year 2000 gives rise to serious concern .
I regret that these amendments were not adopted .
I also agree with the text that there is a need to prevent waste from being generated and to retrieve strategic raw materials .
it is equally important to ensure that similar bi-partisanship exists in its Sri Lankan counterpart .
this is an operational task involving exchanging information , analysing risks , research and coordinated joint Frontex operations .
the Member States and the Commission also agree that the legal status of the External Action Service should reflect and support the unique role , sui generis , that it has within the EU system .
ladies and gentlemen , we know that it is the participation of civil societies in the process and the democratic and parliamentary monitoring of the Euro-Mediterranean policies that are key to the revival of a virtuous dynamic , of a dynamic for peace , and of a dynamic for sustainable development and for human rights .
serious account must be taken of the terrorist threat , on both sides of the Atlantic , because it constitutes not only one of the greatest threats to democracy , the free exercise of human rights and free economic and social development ; above all , it constitutes an attack on the most fundamental of human rights ; the right to life .
in this context , we must be very clear about this debate on the budget .
in view of the violence committed by young people , it is intolerable that young people should be allowed to carry weapons , that they should use them to inflict wounds and worse , and that party drugs and other intoxicants should circulate among them ; our teachers therefore need to be trained in the prevention of violence , theft , vandalism and drug-dealing .
the Commission is also in the process of collecting any information available in other Member States concerning the vessel Proba Koala and its journey .
the policies pursued by the Iranian regime do not respond to the justifiable demands of Iranian citizens .
so what are the Irish saying by abstaining so heavily ?
the contradiction is most marked with regard to hospital care and extends to all judgments : I would stress that it relates to all of them not just those cases where the Council has already achieved consensus .
this is a debate that should be held within society .
this partnership has become necessary , bearing in mind not only Mexico &apos;s important role on the global political and economic stage , but also its very close economic ties with the European Union .
I would be grateful if he could tell President Sarkozy that we ought not to upset the prospects for ratification of the Treaty by reopening quarrels about procedures and the balance of power .
furthermore , swift and realistic action needs to be taken to check the tendency to make the carriers bear the full weight of new social and political trends - apart from the sacrosanct safety regulations for the employees and for other road users , the carriers are now being expected to bear the environmental cost , together with the external costs that are being internalized .
if the truth be told , a number of European leaders knew that their countries would reject this thinly veiled constitution .
it is unacceptable for lives to be destroyed and regions ruined in order to pay higher dividends to shareholders .
that is essentially laid down in the Treaty that you have ratified and that we intend to ratify , in the provisions on a common foreign and security policy .
the quest for equality should permeate the work of the Directorate-General for Development at all levels . It is not to be brought in as a &quot; sort of optional add-on &quot; .
our discussions were lively , but also very fair , and we were very fair-minded in our dealings with each other .
.
we know , however , that without strong technical and political commitment from the Commission itself , none of the actors concerned will help in this regard .
furthermore , everything happened so quickly that unexpected deaths and floods occurred as a result .
secondly , we must find ways of tackling the shortage of health professionals in low-income countries .
for me , there are three urgent cases : 1 . Dr Fan Yafeng , a prominent Christian human rights lawyer and pastor of the Beijing house church , who has been under house arrest since 1 November 2010 and who has for weeks been weighed down by the chicanery and machinations of the Chinese intelligence service .
that gives rises to crises of rejection , failure to act , the problems national communities experience in assimilating Community directives : in other words , the Union may fail because citizens do not perceive themselves as subjects but as the objects of decisions of the Community Institutions or even , in some respects , the victims of what is decided at a Community level .
I would stress that we are confident that the authorities had in no way encouraged such incidents and that it was the result of seriously inappropriate behaviour on the part of the forces of the law . I therefore urge all the Members not to turn this into a national issue , for I consider that the content of the joint resolution is acceptable to all and can be adopted unanimously .
we no doubt need to work on the right balance between ambition and realism , which is why we are working on medium-term priority tasks for the TEC .
in writing . - I support this report and would use this opportunity to reinforce the view that there has to be an integrated approach to cohesion policy .
I sometimes tell myself that &apos; we are learning nothing &apos; or as the Latin saying goes &apos; oportet ut scandala eveniat ! &apos; .
once again a relaxed policy mix is favourable to growth and employment because it makes it possible to relax the monetary conditions .
in the EU at this time , there are about 200 million cars of all different varieties . They represent an enormous burden on the environment , now as well as in the future , and they reveal the great economic concerns which have arisen with the vehicles .
we wait until a white person is murdered before we take renewed interest in a conflict in Burundi that has taken so many thousands of people into their graves .
what effect do you envisage the code as having on arms exports from the EU ?
nor is it surprising that they need to invent pretexts .
I will begin with the amendments the Commission cannot accept .
when will the Commission carry out such a study and take steps on corruption which will give it credibility in the eyes of the public ?
with an economic structure made up mainly of small family businesses , the majority of women work very hard but have no economic or social rights , since they do not have a sufficiently clear work status , and in many cases they work in conditions that are highly prejudicial to their health .
in addition to making up the majority of the population , women are also the most dynamic element in society : it is women who have made the greatest contribution to the creation of new enterprises in Europe in recent years ; a greater percentage of young women obtain irregular work contracts than men , and in many of our regions , they are the main feature of the innovation , training , performance and flexibility development model .
I think there is a need for the Christian Democrats to face up to this fact and for this not to be taken , as it were , ad absurdum by means of special bilateral arrangements between the Member States , with conservatives remaining silent in the face of this practice .
that would certainly be an amazing feat , given the Council &apos; s loaded schedule , but it will , above all , show , on the eve of the Laeken Summit , that the European Union has now achieved a certain maturity in the development of European criminal justice and that it is capable of realising the objectives that it set itself .
I would refer him to Mrs Villiers &apos; very pertinent comments which directly opposed his views .
but charging EUR 60 - a third of a month &apos;s salary in Belarus - for a visa flies in the face of that policy .
it is also surprising that these western superpowers , paragons of democratic virtues , are preparing so cynically to breach the peace .
two representatives from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament therefore now have the floor .
Belarus is the missing piece of Europe &apos;s democratic jigsaw puzzle , and I long for the day when it rejoins the European family .
finally , the Commission must reintroduce an appropriate budget line for &apos; natural disasters involving Member States &apos; , and make the regions affected eligible for Structural Funds .
the postponement will make it possible to give companies the necessary legal certainty but also to carry out further evaluations with regard to a satisfactory level of standard VAT rates throughout the EU .
the euro is the guarantee of European stability , growth and unity .
on 2 May last , the European Council accepted this Commission recommendation .
I would also like to say that I share the rapporteur &apos; s opinion in underlining the importance of education and training , something that has been noted by other speakers .
finally , in view of the fact that this draft Community budget is the lowest , in relative terms , since 1987 , representing less than 1 % of Community gross national income , I would like to know how the principle of economic and social cohesion in the European Union will be safeguarded . I would ask , in particular , how we will fight for social inclusion and employment growth , given that enlargement in 2004 will see the accession of 10 new countries whose average per capita income is only about 40 % of the Community average .
let us remember that 90 % of the EU &apos;s external trade and almost 40 % of its internal trade passes through ports .
hence , as Mr Karas has stated to his credit , our Group is resolutely opposed to the introduction of the Tobin tax .
further decisions along these lines will be necessary during the forthcoming budget year .
I am pleased to see that support also extended into the important area of agriculture , one of the more difficult areas in negotiation .
this directive seeks to introduce European-Union-wide controls for the marketing and use of biocidal products , which are a wide variety of chemical substances , used to control disease , pests and other nuisances .
that is why we are withdrawing our resolution .
the report highlights that the EIDHR was created at Parliament ’ s initiative , and that Parliament has used its budgetary powers to increase substantially the resources earmarked for the protection of human rights and democracy .
therefore , I understand that the fundamental questions - and I have listened attentively to the President-in-Office of the Council - will raise other questions and this requires an Intergovernmental Conference , which must be sufficiently ambitious .
Europe can only benefit from cooperating in this area with Israel , which is particularly active in fields such as seed production and environmental biology .
in short , VAT will cease to be an economic instrument or a means of increasing tax revenue .
they protect their stability and survival by means of total control over the flow of information .
what does Commission Vice-President Wallström think ?
as I already stated earlier today in a different debate , it should be clear that neither the European Commission nor the European Parliament have magic wands at their disposal because , at the end of the day , it is the Council and the Member States that will have to take action in this area .
the rockets are not going to stop in the current situation , and if Israel is to be secure we therefore have to say to it , &apos; The blockade is making life impossible for the Palestinians and that is endangering the security of Israel &apos; .
this Union is much more complex than before : it takes time and patience to find the necessary consensus .
the concept , as Mrs Kinnock rightly says , of good governance and respect for democracy are prerequisites for European Union aid .
I find it absolutely horrifying that metroxyprogesteronacetate is present in sugar syrup and soft drinks !
let us leave this as a legacy to our successors convening on 19 July : it will depend on their wisdom , determination and ability to cooperate whether the unfavourable processes can be reversed or the European social system will remain just a congenial experiment that is doomed to end in failure because of lack of economic support .
corresponding provisions , modelled on Rule 44 or Rule 52 , could be inserted in the Rules of Procedure .
the Commission will draw up a summary of the main developments in the Member States .
the Committee on Development and Cooperation therefore sees a danger that the formation of new regional centres and the move towards regional offices - and good reasons can certainly be put forward in favour of this - could in practice lead to a thinning out of delegation structures in developing countries .
there is no provision intended to deal with negative conflicts of jurisdiction .
we now have to implement them .
we will examine this matter in depth in order to provide clear rules , prevent misleading information and facilitate responsible choices by consumers when purchasing textile products .
ultimately , this is a matter of solidarity .
they have all responded , although inconsistently .
in my country , for example , it will be thought impossible as a goal to be achieved every year unless the initial energy-effective situation we already have is taken into consideration .
amendments 89 to 96 which I and a number of other colleagues have tabled attempt to strengthen their position , not because we have anything against the definition of copyright and the protection of rights holders , but because we consider other cultural matters as well .
this , I believe , is a truism .
they must be helped to do so in the face of the two or three agro-industrial monopolies .
it is not acceptable for the budgetary authorities to be so out of step with previously agreed commitments , but it also demonstrates that we must all face up to some tough choices .
I think this is a point to be looked at carefully when it comes to renegotiating the rules for the next Convention .
I would like it recorded in the Minutes that Parliament adopted 36 amendments at first reading .
I regret , therefore , that attempts to require the Bank to publish the names of those present , the voting on monetary actions , after a grace period of some two years and the publication of the ECB &apos; s econometric models were defeated at committee stage and have not been put before this House today .
if the EU is actually to maintain its leading role in the matter of climate protection , we should raise our target to at least -30 % , one which you have already stated the case for .
if we do that then we can feed that into the budgetary process and make sure that we are more on track during the course of the year .
 
7 . Developing civil dialogue under the Treaty of Lisbon (
the next item item is the report ( A4-0066 / 99 ) by Mrs André-Léonard , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Security and Defence Policy , on the Communication from the Commission on EU-India Enhanced Partnership ( COM ( 96 ) 0275 - C4-0407 / 96 ) .
are we going to continue to defend the CAP against what are , or ought to be , our own interests , namely that agricultural products should be imported from the Maghreb with the consequent generation of employment and maybe even a fall in immigration ?
it was the first victim of the alliance of Hitler and Stalin , who together launched the Second World War .
that is why we have tried to use MEDIA to complement what the Member States should be and are doing , but that is not enough either , and some speakers have justifiably mentioned the abortive experiment with a guarantee fund in the past .
it is also true that Western politicians and societies took this slogan to heart as they supported the people of Poland in their struggle for national sovereignty and democracy .
of course , they will deprive those not large enough of that funding .
the feasibility of financial guarantees or insurance policies has not been properly developed with the industry and it is unclear whether such guarantees would be available from the insurance sector .
but consumers will make e-commerce in financial services a success only if they have confidence in it , if the contractual or non-contractual provisions are in place to safeguard their rights and to give them appropriate help if they have complaints in cross-border business .
I can only ask Parliament to now also oppose a whittling away of Community initiatives . In addition , the Commission has always believed that Interreg should be the most important of these three , and this could mean that around 50 % of the funds for Community initiatives - that is , from the Community initiatives &apos; total 5 % slice of the cake - should be given to Interreg .
we shall await the court ruling with respect , but please do be patient and sensible in your dealings with Mr Klaus .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would firstly like to thank the political groups in this House for their cooperation in the production of this report , which has been unanimously approved by the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy and I would like to stress this cooperation since it does not happen very often .
accordingly , the Middle East , Kosovo , food aid and macrofinancial assistance are patently underestimated .
this sends out a positive signal because it indicates that the claim that we , as social democrats , make in this House is taken seriously by you , because we still have some distance to go before the final vote on the Commission .
it waited a long time and gave what were in fact wholly inadequate answers as to what the solution might be .
in the fourth round of mutual evaluations on the practical implementation of the European Arrest Warrant in all Member States , it was found that only in a few countries were there examples of issuing European Arrest Warrants for relatively minor offences .
I would like to thank Mrs Fraisse for this report and for her passionate defence of this issue as a whole .
this situation leads women to have recourse to abortions carried out in dangerous conditions , and it causes as many as 78 000 deaths each year .
in the amendment referred to by Mr Casaca which , as he knows , we made together , there is a parenthesis at the end &apos; ( via , especially , the TIM ) &apos; , which is part of the oral amendment .
the legislation in force , both national and Community , is still often based on the idea that security reserves are an instrument which is only used when the shortage of oil is serious .
we purchase over 90 % of African agricultural exports and 45 % of Central and South American agricultural exports .
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( ES ) Mr President , beyond mere rhetoric , what the EP wants from the ambitious resolution it intends to adopt tomorrow is to match its words with actions , supporting the Lima agenda in terms of poverty and social exclusion as well as protecting the environment and fighting climate change with a raft of measures .
the aim of the present draft is to consolidate that legislation on the basis of subsequent experience .
we are also working with the Finance Minister , not only on the Temporary International Mechanism ( TIM ) , but also on institution building and technical assistance , helping them particularly on the question of customs , revenue collection and on auditing .
Mr President , the Commission is proposing changes to trade arrangements for processed agricultural products .
another important issue in the adopted resolution is that of coordinating EU mechanisms for the prevention of climate change and , in particular , the effective use of the Solidarity Fund to limit the consequences of fires .
I would be grateful if you could tell us , Mr Berlusconi , whether people who do not comply with that legislation will be the subject of criminal prosecution , because non-compliance is an offence , and I also call on the Commission to take appropriate action if it is aware of such non-compliance .
in the meantime , coal will remain an important source of primary energy , even though it is necessary to develop cleaner technologies .
the first function , integration into national systems , is still essential , because at present , the acceptability of Union regulations calls for even greater transparency and for much wider consultation .
Mr Gawronski is right : this is about spending tax payers &apos; money .
all the languages are eligible for this programme .
we hope that the setting up of a European database , which also springs from a suggestion made by Parliament , will contribute towards this .
we therefore wish to correct this here verbally .
in my opinion , it is not enough to have national policies to combat unemployment from now on . As President Santer pointed out and as was confirmed by the Luxembourg summit , what we need is a Community employment policy .
I would also ask for your assurance that the programme of culling is being carried out systematically , and that the interim research results will be made available promptly to the parliamentary committee responsible .
in particular , we do not support the change in the legal basis , the extension of the instrument ’ s scope to enable the funding of preventive measures , or the budget increase .
the other one , made by a speaker from the Socialist group , advises us not to treat this House like a museum containing old objects that must not be moved .
there is less risk of dogmatism when it comes to equality between women and men , but overly radical positions are still held .
the way the system has changed has already been mentioned .
so we must share with them the burden of combating terrorism .
what is even more important is the transport sector .
and there is hypocrisy with regard to the political responsibilities .
Africa has changed profoundly in recent years and has acquired a continental institutional architecture that resembles our own in many respects .
to support the Darfur peace process , in 2004 the African Union Mission in Sudan ( AMIS ) was set up .
world events , the terrorist attacks of 11 September , the war in Afghanistan , and the crisis in the Middle East have all given rise to new budgetary requirements .
the same applies to another issue that has attracted attention in the Human Rights Commission , namely the resolution regarding the human rights situation in Cuba , for which the Czech Republic and Poland took responsibility last year .
if not , we will be fighting a running battle .
this is why the bridge connecting one group of people opposed to any ban to the group of people holding a different view passes through you .
I ask for a debate to be opened on this matter .
we differ in particular on doing away with the unanimity requirement in these matters and on tightening Community requirements relating to the taxation of products .
therefore , we must say &apos; yes &apos; to integrity and &apos; no &apos; to protectionism .
the United Nations , the European Union and the international community in general must maintain pressure on Indonesia so as to force it to accept a military presence to guarantee the neutrality of the referendum and to stop this turning into a sham with fairly predictable and bloody consequences .
for the SME world , that means added value that is not to be underestimated .
whatever the Member States decide , diversification of fuel sources naturally includes – and I think this is particularly important – diversification of supplier countries , so far as energy imports are concerned ; but renewable energy sources are also particularly important here .
we should ask the EU Presidency and the Commission to ask the UN to become more involved by sending a permanent team - and even a peacekeeping force - there to prevent more attacks and prevent these people being moved by force to other parts of Iraq .
we have not calculated the cost of that decommissioning in the correct place , and it is currently , completely irregularly , being put into a research budget .
we should do this particularly in highly industrialised areas .
every euro that we spend in this area repays the whole of society not that many years later .
a few days later , Turkish Cypriot trade union leaders rallying outside the European Parliament in Brussels chanted that the Turkish political leadership does not only insult the MEPs who voted in favour of Mrs Oomen-Ruijten &apos;s report ; it also insults the Turkish Cypriots who turned out in force in occupied Cyprus to protest against the repression exerted over them by the 40 000 Turkish troops and countless numbers of Turkish settlers .
of course we are waiting directly for the Commission proposal on the preconditions for organ transplants , as you yourself promised us Commissioner .
the European Community ’ s financial contribution of approximately 75 % of total donor contributions will be implemented by the UN Development Programme .
the aspirations of the new Belarus are a far cry from the aims of Europe ’ s last remaining tyrant , Alexander Lukashenko , who has cheated at the polls , threatened the opposition in the squares and made use of prisons just as Stalin did in his day .
particularly those who openly declare their Bulgarian ethnic origin are sometimes subject to discrimination .
thank you for this debate .
with luck , all the problems over the legal base for providing funds have been resolved .
we do not know what the future of the system will be but we do know that it is incredibly expensive at present .
Mr President , both these reports deal with safety at sea , which is a vital issue , not just because disasters occur on a regular basis , as has always been the case and is sadly always likely to be so , but also in terms of minimizing the consequences of those disasters which are unavoidable .
Mr President , the fact that we need to address ourselves to the subject of equal treatment for men and women in occupational social security schemes is in itself extremely regrettable .
it is to my satisfaction that Mr Schwab prepared such an excellent report .
the opinions of the European Parliament &apos;s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Economic and Social Committee were not taken into account .
the last speaker , Claudia Roth , was right when she pointed to a democratic solution .
you propose continuing down the same track , bolstering up the same policy , ever more generously financing the same actions .
fifthly , on derogations .
I highlight the fact that the British Canoe Union is begging us not to support the extension of this directive to recreational waters .
in addition to the issue of the &apos; co-respondent &apos; mechanism - in other words , the European Union along with a Member State - when there is an appeal against a Member State before the Strasbourg Court , one of the subjects that is being dealt with in a working group on this matter is that of exhausting the judicial remedies of the Luxembourg Court first , before going to the European Court of Human Rights .
in this situation , it is evident that we must maintain the sanctions , we must strengthen them and we must try to ensure that the European Union , and not only the Union , implements a policy with those characteristics , aimed at establishing a civil government , a government based on the participation of the political opposition and the democratic powers in Nigeria , one which can prepare for free elections .
to achieve this , the Council has planned to hold some 15 working meetings throughout the second half of 2008 .
this novelty will be seen in the way the relations between Europe and Latin America are to be organised around three themes : the first is the debate on the rules of the game in the process of globalisation and , particularly , the question of democracy and the reduction of poverty ; the second is the question of regional political integration ; and the third is the joint management of major environmental crises .
are the Member States really willing to deal with the signing-off of accounts in the way we have indicated ?
other key points to the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats are the fact that confidential company data is protected more effectively , registration is better tailored to the Nassauer / Sacconi package - it is just unfortunate that nothing more came of this - and red tape is being reduced to a minimum .
I am delighted that we have succeeded with the rapporteur and numerous other members in finding a good , common line on most aspects of this very demanding subject and would like to thank them for that .
when my constituents write to me and say &apos; Look , I am not getting a good service in my constituency and I would like to travel abroad to another EU Member State to get better health services &apos; , they are uncertain of their legal position .
until now there has not been any protection for residents as a specific exposure group .
according to the intentions of Agenda 21 , which are also a guiding thread for the Commission , it is individuals , not the authorities , who own their environment .
our group stresses the importance of also having flexibility in classification so that administrative factors and , for example , geographical , social and economic circumstances will be taken into consideration as appropriate .
a voluntary instrument is all very well so long as it is not required to replace framework directives that have not been passed .
so the solution is to promote decent work and upgrading of social standards all over the world .
the challenge is to make the system the very best .
we must bear that in mind if we do not want to become a society of robots or yes-men .
these trade preferences , which currently apply to Bosnia and Herzegovina , Serbia and Kosovo , were granted for a period ending on 31 December 2010 , but their validity should now be extended to 31 December 2015 so as not to jeopardise these countries &apos; economic recovery .
progress depends first and foremost on the commitment displayed by the partner government in highlighting road safety issues , collecting and analysing accident figures , introducing rules and regulations , defining standards and setting-up and strengthening the organisations responsible for the general implementation of road safety policy .
Mrs Grossetête , who is a member of the largest political grouping in the European Parliament , has also expressed to us certain demands and requirements , and I thank her for that .
fourthly , we have responded to the lack of transparency by introducing a budget support programme , and Greenland &apos;s regional government has consequently committed itself to a structural reform of its fisheries policy , aiming at greater privatisation and a reduction in subsidies .
we therefore believe that once the scientists have established the biological parameters — and this report includes , for example , the biomass objective to be achieved in order for a population to be considered recovered — the Member States must be allowed a degree of flexibility in achieving this objective in a manner most suited to the characteristics of their fleets .
my own question to you is this : do you yourself have a plan for achieving this 30 % reduction personally in your own sphere of activity ?
I also think that the rapporteur agrees rather too much with the Commission &apos;s opinion that the massive introduction of new information technologies in schools will solve a lot of problems .
we have a kind of stalemate in the Council , where everyone is waiting for the opinion of Parliament , and I am convinced that adoption of my report will persuade the Czech Republic , which currently holds the presidency , to renew discussion and find a rational compromise in the Council .
the recommendation to draw up a programme of practical action that would help identify existing obstacles is therefore fully justified .
we must not forget however about another necessity : to save energy .
in view of the inadmissible role played by the Commission during the referendums on the so-called &apos; European constitution &apos; conducted in 2005 , such intentions , long proclaimed and now reaffirmed , will , if they are carried out , represent a genuine interference in the process of ratification which is a matter for each Member State .
under discussion here is a global agreement that goes much further than figures and quantities of goods to be traded .
yet here they are in our own building .
the Irish presidency is right to focus on enlargement .
in this case too , we must call upon Eurojust to continue in this direction , improving its financial management .
more information can be found on the website .
Mr President , I should like to thank Mr Alexander for his presence here this afternoon , together with Mr Verheugen , whom I left in plenary last night at 11.47 p.m. and who has covered a lot of ground this part-session in Strasbourg .
the fifth framework programme of research should place us in a position where we can support research work into many of the technical issues that were indicated , especially in terms of standards for processing , conserving and transferring information and the creation of links through Community projects .
consequently , as demanded by workers and citizens almost everywhere , including in Portugal last weekend , for example , at the impressive demonstration in Lisbon , it is time to heed the calls of the citizens and the workers .
the different practices and laws that exist in the Member States would make it an especially awkward task .
I would like to begin by mentioning the good work that has been possible within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , thanks to proposals by its various members , and to highlight the role that the rapporteur , our colleague , Mr Klinz , played in bringing about a positive result .
foot-and-mouth is certainly raging in the Member State I come from and in the region that I represent .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
on the contrary , the Commission also wants to achieve more satisfactory results for this financing instrument , which is so important to development policy , and this applies in particular to the question of the speed of aid .
it is about economics , and only if we tackle economics will we solve the problems .
I hope that the Commission will be guided by the spirit of this directive and make its own payments on time , because here too , I repeat , this is breach of contract .
we should also very seriously consider that the overwhelming weight of European public opinion appears to be particularly cautious about any further expansion , and this is something that we cannot ignore .
. – Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen .
there are considerable differences of opinion between Member States , as well as considerable differences in distribution .
indeed , as he says , we have reached a very satisfactory outcome .
I believe that the coordinators of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs are meeting tomorrow to appoint a rapporteur .
we have also accepted your call , Mr Podestà , for greater emphasis to be put on the economic potential in the cultural sector and have incorporated this aspect in the cooperation with the Italian authorities , for it is quite clear that Italy is particularly well placed to use this economic potential .
as what will prove to be the precedent of the Abbruzes case shows , there is no provision for compensation in order to lessen the shock of a sudden discontinuation of structural aid .
I would like to say a few words on the Intergovernmental Conference and the draft European Constitution .
the custom and practice is that we do vote on the draft decision but I agree with both Mr Wuermeling and Mr Corbett that they have a point .
let me conclude by saying that it is easy for us to explain to any critically-minded consumer that healthy meat on healthy bone is part of good diet .
I should also , however , like to address two points , which continue to be crucial for relations between the European Union and Turkey .
at the same time , however , we are extremely critical of the investment of a total of EUR 549.6 million to extend the KAD building in Luxembourg , and we do not at all share the rapporteur &apos;s expectation that this will result in savings in the long term .
a European Information System worthy of that name can only be achieved if there is real cooperation between the Commission and Parliament .
nobody ever complained about this in the past twenty years , even though it was most anti-democratic .
we need more decentralization , and we need to improve our energy efficiency and develop renewable sources of energy .
then amend the next phrase to read : &apos; human rights violations such as torture , censorship , rape and extra-judicial executions in Iran &apos; .
there are interesting imbalances within it .
these waters already suffer unacceptable levels of radioactive pollution from Sellafield .
further , it has become evident that the mandate of the United Nations Observation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( MONUC ) must be amended , as was previously proposed .
unfortunately , they are spreading like gangrene at all levels of our society , and although the fight is not lost , it is far from being won .
the population is suffering from the civil war , which has lasted nearly 20 years , with catastrophic economic results , and it is suffering under the self-aggrandisement and lack of human respect of the Civil War Party .
but that can be discussed .
practical support of this kind would be a real help in getting the local markets and mutual trade off the ground .
therefore , as has been said , it is sadly ironic that despite having brought forward organic crop regulations several years ago , the Commission has only now come up to date with livestock production in the wake of a stream of health disasters related to meat .
in this regard , I think of Afghanistan or the Balkans .
. – Mr President , I warmly support the rapporteur .
may I remind you , Mr Kreissl-Dörfler , that it was by concession from the Chair that you were able to take the floor , as I do not want to launch another debate at this stage of the vote .
in these circumstances , it is important that Parliament reiterates its appeal to the Council and to European Union Member States to maintain and increase the pressure on the Iranian regime on human rights issues .
as I see it , 12.5 % or 15 % ought not to be beyond the bounds of possibility as an effective means of ensuring that , in the European Union , no oil gets on to the market and into the petrol pumps unless it contains a specified proportion of biofuels .
thirdly , there are those intended to reinforce the role of the social partners in the Agency ’ s network in the Member States – a very important point – and those intended to reinforce cooperation with other Community bodies in the social policy area .
we list three alternative ways forward : one , an international treaty , with , of course , special provisions for this region compared to the Antarctic ; two , a moratorium , pending new scientific research and a better understanding of the region and its vulnerability or sensitivity , but also pending the results of many energy alternatives that are now developing very progressively .
in particular would the EC continue to disburse budget support if a country were off track solely on non-core elements of an IMF PRGF e.g. a condition to privatise a state body ?
a continuing increase in imports consequently makes our oil dependency high and the amount that we are paying for buying energy resources is increasing all the time .
I would end by saying that the world is not in acute need of more conflicts .
this mission is being conducted under the auspices of the United Nations and we cannot have a situation where the European Union is the only one to fulfil its obligations .
I am sure you will have noticed from the e-mails that we have received and from the heated debate that has taken place - even within some of the groups - that this is an issue that is being watched very closely by many of our citizens , who want to see exactly what position politicians in this Parliament will take on this matter .
and , last of all , I would like to thank the rapporteurs once again and also to assure them that we will take their suggestions and comments seriously .
2 . Women &apos;s rights in Saudi Arabia
why ?
let me ask the Commissioner : what is the scientific basis for these 7 years ?
we , of course , need the Member States to ensure that adequate funding is made available from national budgets , and I would like to point out again that Parliament has always supported a higher level of funding for these networks .
I was one of three Members of the European Parliament on this delegation , and that was not enough .
finally , Amendments Nos 18 , 22 and 33 cannot be accepted simply because their content is outside the scope of the revised STCW Convention on which the present proposal before the House is based .
if that does not work , then we need to be decisive and cut the Gordian knot .
amendment No 1 in the French version deletes illegal immigration and Amendment No 4 omits the expression &apos; police authorities &apos; .
I should like to say that this is a report that is based on the principle of subsidiarity .
it has made more progress in the last three months than in the previous three years .
on the trade side , the agreement will cover important issues for both sides such as IPR , investment , non-tariff trade barriers , capital movements , sustainable trade , and natural resources and competition .
this is about the regulations for long-term management plans .
these activities cannot , under any circumstances , be classified as crimes by the framework decision , even when they do occasionally get out of hand .
the next item is the report ( A5-0172 / 2003 ) by Mr Hernández Mollar on behalf of the Committee on Citizens &apos; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs on the proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the EU-USA agreements on judicial cooperation in criminal matters and extradition ( ( INI ) 2003 / 2003 ) .
this beggars belief , especially if the rules change and are adapted virtually by the day , as has been the case .
those are the deficiencies that people are suffering from .
I made a visit as President , but it was open to those who wished to associate themselves with it .
I refer to increasing the cost of fuel , with negative implications for the financial health of businesses and the citizens ’ standard of living .
the candidate Member States expect the European Union to be a constitutional community based on the common acceptance of values which are mostly of a Jewish-Christian origin .
I believe that we should not be automatically led along , without debate , without discussion , without even , at times , consultation , in blind solidarity with the United States .
in this connection , let me briefly point out that the EU House , the EU information centre , will open in the Turkmen capital of Ashgabat in spring , which will make our measures much more visible there .
the president of the Czech parliament and I have for many years been able to talk intimately and in confidence with one another .
2004 will therefore need to be a very successful year , as it potentially can be , given the impending historic enlargement and unification of Europe .
I must therefore , unfortunately , observe that the Commission cannot accept the amendments proposed in the report .
there is no doubt that it is the victim who must provide proof of the harm caused by a clearly identified product .
a European transparency initiative - of the kind I have talked about on a number of occasions in Parliament - is in the process of being developed .
the Commission ’ s communication gives a detailed overview of the 27 manufacturing sectors and , with sensitivity , combines a range of sectoral actions with cross-sectoral policy initiatives .
it is still too early to fix a date for accession .
they are far better than the farmed variety .
we have a fundamental interest in seeing our neighbour admitted into this Community as soon as possible .
the rapporteur is right to condemn the Turkish authorities ’ failure to respect trade union freedom and to criticise the progress of the trial of Leyla Zana and other Turkish MPs of Kurdish origin .
the Albanians believe they suffered an injustice in 1913 when a large part of their native region was not assigned to the new state of Albania that had just seceded from Turkey .
I cannot quite see how tobacco fits into this scenario .
this audit will eliminate duplication and reduce administrative costs by more than 15 % .
I therefore call on the Commission to give an urgent account of the Chinese accession talks to Parliament , and particularly as to how they may affect our preparations for Seattle , so that Parliament can vote tomorrow on Mr Schwaiger &apos; s report in full command of all the relevant facts .
my impression is that the major global financial crisis and the subsequent economic crisis have not made the job of bringing East and West closer together within the EU any easier . On the contrary , the challenges have become greater because the imbalances represent a major problem .
in order to fight against AIDS , tuberculosis , malaria and other infectious diseases , these countries need vaccines to which they currently do not have access and which they cannot buy .
we must appeal to the Member States to desist from any illegal activities in which they may have been engaging , to exercise more effective democratic control of their intelligence agencies and to attach greater importance to protecting the rights of all citizens of the European Union in addition to those of their own nationals .
.
you yourself stressed the obvious need for a trade agreement with unambiguous rules , and the negotiations have also been going on too long already , but what we need is an agreement with fair conditions for both parties .
I have just returned from a visit , as part of a delegation , to the Kurdish part of Turkey , the object of which was to campaign for the rights of the Kurdish people , yet how much more must we make it our concern that the Iraqi Kurds are not wiped out !
so the time has now come to strengthen the right of asylum as set out in the Geneva Convention ; the idea of temporary protection , which does not prejudge recognition of refugee status , goes in that direction .
it was a bias that was aiming to make economic issues the regulator for air activity and the main method of improving things .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
hence I feel that I have made it quite clear that the legal basis should be Article 130s , paragraph 1 .
it seems to me that the same thing could be said of the elderly .
a crisis-simulation exercise took place in 2006 . As a follow-up to that exercise , the Council will reflect in 2007 on how better to address cross-border crisis situations and clarify burden-sharing arrangements .
( FI ) Madam President , I could not vote in favour of this resolution either , at least not in its present form when we came to vote on it .
combing the work of several reports it has turned out to be pretty coherent , for which thanks are due especially to Mr Oostlander and also to the chairman of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs , Tom Spencer .
I do not like it , but it is the only way to move forward .
it will not produce a single euro more for the Community &apos;s budget , and will result in the Commission being starved of funds and unable to operate effectively .
this case seems to exemplify the discrimination that exists against Christian ministers of religion in certain Member States of the Union when they are in dispute with their ecclesiastical authorities .
in writing . - I voted against .
Mr President , I want to welcome the Leonardo II programme , in particular the report introduced by Mrs Waddington this morning which , as usual , is excellent .
I would like to thank you for this opportunity .
we have conveyed the message of the responsibility of the Greek Government , which must handle an extremely difficult situation , a situation that it inherited .
it is a problem that should be a cause for concern to everyone in Europe .
it is the result of a carefully negotiated compromise within the intergroup of which I am chairman , which has thus once again shown how useful and dynamic it is .
lastly , on the subject of sustainable growth , the European Council will need to adopt tangible decisions on the Growth Initiative , especially where the quick-start programme is concerned , and will receive a report from the Commission containing proposals for the reinforcement of the production framework , with a view to preventing deindustrialisation .
it is to be hoped that the application of common rules will be accompanied by the harmonisation of national perceptions , and this particularly relates to the sustainability of public sector funding with a view to preventing the situations that engulfed Greece and Ireland from arising in the future .
Mr President , the present directive is important in so far as it helps prevent our being faced with hazardous waste from end-of-life vehicles and in so far as it promotes the re-use and recycling of materials from scrapped cars .
a great deal of time , within the constraints that very busy people always face , was spent discussing the issue of reweighting votes and the qualified majority .
these employment agencies treat workers like modern-day slaves : they use them until they are worn out , pay them peanuts , move them around at will and arbitrarily get rid of them .
( PL ) Mr President , Mr Alexander Milinkiewicz , the leader of the opposition in Belarus , has been detained once again in Minsk today .
there is increasing acceptance amongst Arabs of the desirability of a negotiated solution , whilst Prime Minister Sharon himself has talked of the damage to Israel &apos;s economy and society caused by the continuing violence , and the impossibility of permanent occupation and Israeli rule over four million Palestinians .
respect for the official languages of each Member State of the European Union is laid down in the Treaties .
I am thinking here of the work we are already doing , helping our partner countries establish effective law enforcement institutions , improve border management and fight money-laundering .
we should be trying to exercise those powers in a way that is even more democratically accountable .
not even the minimum sum envisaged for successful operation of the fund has been secured .
we , on top of the treaty request , we altogether - I mean all budgetary authorities and the Commission - agreed to add two and a half months to the procedure , mainly because at that time there was no electronic mail .
this is an astonishing statement given than the initial estimates are far over EUR 1 000 000 and it is costing us EUR 60 000 just for a study to establish the actual figures : hardly peanuts .
the Commission has a duty to improve the coherence of its actions for tourism with other related Community policies .
given economic uncertainties , countries will have their national abilities to make responses to given situations greatly reduced , and there will be nothing at European level to take over that responsibility .
if there really is a winner from processes of monopolistic concentration in the air transport sector - which is what inevitably follows liberalisation and &apos; free competition &apos; - it is not the passengers , nor the workers , nor many of the so-called &apos; flag carrier &apos; airlines , but rather the major European companies in the sector .
it concerned a company which did not manage to deal with its poisonous waste but chose instead to bury it in the ground and in that way put a whole district at risk .
on the other hand , I would like to draw attention to a point made by Mr Mulder in his report on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development : he points out that , with an eye to Project 2000 , we cannot expect to finance the enlargement of the European Union out of shavings off agricultural spending .
although what the President-in-Office of the Council tells us , and what you tell us , is right , cannot be denied and holds true in all respects , it is not enough .
Mr President , Mr McCartin , allow me to repeat that the European Union naturally seeks to protect all particularist and minority groups and takes an interest in all the various languages .
what I would like to emphasize here is that any attempt to introduce exceptional treatments in the Community framework will be certainly reflected in the 2009 political vote , which might provide reasons for the radicalization of an electorate that voted very enthusiastically in favour of these countries &apos; accession to the EU .
I am also of the opinion that even better plants can be cultivated with modern plant production .
as regards the development of the right to consumption , we note that there is very little cross-border consumption , around 6 % , which is obviously too little .
in the spirit of the Commission communication , a presentation has been given of the problems that demand good practice at national , regional and local level in a range of sectors .
by contrast , Israel is holding back tax revenue which belongs to the Palestinians and the US Treasury tightened the screws on Palestinian cash this week when it banned American nationals from doing business with the first democratically elected Palestinian Authority .
another thing I should like to add is that this policy , especially with enlargement coming up , must be given material support from the point of view of funding , which is why Parliament is also reiterating once again its position that funding for it cannot be below 0.46 % of gross national product .
we therefore welcome the political signal given by the Commission with this package of measures .
I am therefore persuaded that it will be necessary to grant temporary powers to the Management Committee under Article 186 in order to deliver this support .
documents from third parties will be accessible for the first time and agencies or bodies created by the institutions will also apply the Regulation .
small and medium-sized enterprises in town and country are being wiped out .
the institutions are also planning a number of common seminars and conferences .
look at the figures for complaints and you find a constant increase , but , as I see it , the primary significance of that is not that European administration has become worse , but that more and more members of the public are endeavouring to assert their rights .
so there will be a mid-term review , when we set objectives and guidelines , together with annual controls and annual cooperation in monitoring policies and it is this that will maintain the momentum of the strategy .
it seems to be time for the EU to mediate in absolute secrecy , gradually establishing positions which are then signed by both sides .
this report is even more useful in that it is comprehensive .
although all the participants in the various phases of the process bore these concerns in mind , it became clear that the attitudes of the Council and the Commission on the one hand and of this Parliament on the other were not completely attuned with one another .
I am aware that there is concern in FYROM and elsewhere at the end of the PHARE programme in these countries and , especially , at the loss of association with the PHARE name .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( FR ) Madam President , I wish to propose three measures .
it is high time this was spelt out in a binding text .
the high level of arrears , particularly in the field of the structural funds , must lead to a thorough pruning of unprofitable budget lines .
under the Luxembourg Presidency , the process of EU enlargement will be guided by the decisions taken by the European Council of last December .
in this respect , I wish to remind you that innovation is above all a matter of business , and those who work in businesses .
it is good to see Europe following Britain &apos; s lead .
the Committee on the Environment is proposing the use of Article 100a as the legal basis , whereas the Commission &apos;s proposal is based on Article 130s .
I think that the toys issue and China could be used in explaining why it is so important to have targeted full harmonisation .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , you pointed out just now , Commissioner , that the chemical pollution of surface waters was a threat to the aquatic environment , the ecosystem and , hence , human safety .
the vote will take place at 12 noon .
I am in agreement with all my colleagues who have referred to a bad human rights situation here - it cannot be accepted .
they contain tens of thousands of tonnes of spent nuclear fuel and over 100 tonnes of separated plutonium between them .
the Commission ’ s demand to apply judicial cooperation instruments is a demand that introduces virtual harmonisation , not just as regards trafficking , but also as regards , for example , the definition of categories of banned drugs , which therefore prevents the possibility of national reforms on drugs within national legislation .
if we examine the problems as a whole , we can see that a large number of organizational , financial and personnel measures are necessary , the significance of which , in terms of the practical functioning of the social dialogue and the increasing of its effectiveness at almost all levels , must certainly not be underestimated .
we are well aware that a delegation from this House is about to visit Colombia - next week , in fact , as mentioned by the honourable Member -where it will conduct discussions with the Government , the Opposition , Congress , the Attorney-General and non-governmental organizations .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , it has been said , and rightly so , that the Copenhagen Council put an end to the post-war division of Europe .
they must give greater urgency to achieving a positive DAS because - I repeat my words - it is very , very damaging to the perception of the Union .
Mr President , the last two presidents of Peru , Fujimori and Toledo , presented themselves as miracle-workers and as saviours of the country .
anti-dumping measures must not be abused for protectionist purposes .
perhaps he is excited about the next season at Ferrari , with Kimi Raikkonen driving for them .
I do not support this , I am ashamed of this army , of our governments who are destroying lives and all our human values in the name of security .
the country has manifested its potential as a stabilizing factor in the region via important initiatives and sacrifices .
we now have a lot of proposals on the table , such as the Community patent , a European patent litigation agreement and maybe even some suggestions for finally changing the EPC .
this is when the Commission will be ready to introduce corrective measures .
especially in a situation where we have seen dramatic changes in the price fluctuations in the agricultural sector , it is important that we have valid data on which to base our forecasts .
Anna is not , however , the only victim .
these are European oil companies .
this is my first time in the Chair for Question Time , and , because of the importance of the subject , this is the only time I will break the rule .
the annual report presented to the House today is of particular importance .
as regards the organisation of economic cooperation in the Black Sea region , the European Union recognises and supports the action to promote economic cooperation at regional level , which will increase the area ’ s stability , security and prosperity .
the Central District Court of Buda opened renewed proceedings on 31 March 2010 .
but this situation also shows that there has to be a qualitative improvement in the policy adopted towards the African countries , so that the promotion of human rights , democratisation and conflict prevention - the only conditions that will ensure development - become essential elements of cooperation .
I also found the closing remarks made by the Commissioner a little out of order .
I believe that every politician would hope to be in a position in which , in their lifetime , they could have made at least some difference on behalf of their constituents .
since the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats appeared certain that they could win the Council , and particularly Germany , the latter being its principal opponent , over to this amendment , I was happy to go along with them .
I am reminded of a saying in the work of Nikolai Gogol , along the lines that ‘ the old have not yet died , the young are still unborn , but they all pose a threat to the living ’ .
transfer of bulk data is , of course , sensitive , and we will strive for further reductions in the volume of data during the negotiations .
Finland has proposed that the Union should put time and effort into innovation and competitiveness , transparency , energy , the Northern Dimension and external relations , as well as finding a solution regarding the fate of the Constitution .
it is important to remember that the EIB was originally set up to finance operations within the EU .
what is true of better regulation is true of all other good intentions and of all the good things in this life : it is no good unless something is actually done about it , rather than it just being talked about .
I am naturally astounded therefore at the votes to remove some of the abovementioned points requested by the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group .
the Commission still establishes the maximum global ceiling for the area to be abandoned , distributes the money among the Member States , fixes the minimum surface area unit to be abandoned at half a hectare provided that the trees are planted with a density of 300 or more per hectare .
we have applied this interpretation since 1994 .
as a member of the WTO , China has benefited from the elimination of textile quotas since 1 January 2005 .
what , moreover , do we do on the day that Iran ’ s mullahs export their regime to Iraq ?
but the rules exist to protect minorities in this House and that is the purpose of 12 Members being able to stand up and object to an oral amendment .
in recent months , and indeed up to the Berlin Summit , there have been a number of meetings with the Council on the future of the Cohesion Fund .
given that there is no technology for side-facing seats , then we must say to industry that these particular seats must be phased out .
this objective groups together four separate and distinct actions , namely one for urban areas , one for industrial areas , one for rural and mountain areas and one for fisheries .
in Bali it was decided that a reduction of 25-40 % by 2020 is necessary to save the climate .
pursuant to this same regulation , however , it will still be possible to kidnap terrorists and hold them for short periods in transit countries .
there have been many responses from schools throughout the European Union and also from school children .
there is a certain connection with the Corbett report , which has just been adopted , and in respect of which an amendment tabled by Mr Radwan was adopted , the intention of which was to affect a single technical detail in the way we are now to vote .
amendment No 1 focuses on a well-founded decision on maintaining the ban .
the chairman of the United Nations Security Council made a statement in June 2000 calling on the Secretary-General of the United Nations to set up a committee of experts to investigate the illegal exploitation of the natural resources of the Democratic Republic of Congo .
Mr President , as chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , I wish to express my thanks to the rapporteurs for working through a very important issue at a rather difficult time .
we are debating the lessons for nuclear safety in Europe following the crisis in Japan .
it is clear that an EU strategy for reforming the UN system is largely aimed at safeguarding European , rather than global , interests .
first of all , there is the danger of Islamic terrorism that is lurking in every corner .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted against the report by Mr Karim on an EU-India Free Trade Agreement .
I am convinced that this draft strictly reflects the institutional balance established by the Treaty of Lisbon .
that is why , albeit with a slightly heavy heart , I will be voting in favour of this compromise because , no matter what happens , I want Europe to continue to make progress .
we are calling for the abolition of the system whereby the Chief Executive is chosen by a committee made up of about 800 Hong Kong residents selected by Beijing .
if it now emerges that there is still money in the agriculture budget , there is a moral obligation to redress this competitive disadvantage .
we have control over the clocks and the calendar .
only recently it has been revealed in the United Kingdom that there are hundreds , even thousands , of young children who have been sold into the slave trade from other parts of the world and are now in Europe suffering the most appalling treatment .
it will at some point have to acknowledge that this proposal in its current form cannot enter into force , and even in revised form it will be required to undergo the entire ratification process again .
the European Union is first and foremost an economic union based on moral values .
what we would like is for the financial crisis to be tackled effectively , not only using a couple of billion euros from the plan earmarked for this purpose , but also with every item in the budget , so that Europeans realise that the European Union is not a superfluous expense , but an effective tool for solving their problems .
our efforts must be focused on protecting employment and therefore the European Commission in cooperation with the Presidency will organise an employment summit where the top priority will be measures in the area of employment .
we shall have to make do with that .
the second question I would like to refer to is that Europe is unable to define its own identity .
as regards the Balkans , the Commission and the Bank are currently looking into the possibility of granting the Bank a mandate to operate in Kosovo .
in this regard , the creation of the European Research Council is absolutely essential .
fewer words and more action !
for that purpose , we , the Council , the Commission and Parliament , must really be able to set up and organise a convention with the Economic and Social Committee , with the Committee of the Regions , and with civil society , to reflect on and discuss Europe ’ s economic and social policies : what have been our successes ?
killing , murdering children , murdering mothers and fathers of children , killing children ’ s teachers is the most extreme expression of the most miserable of human behaviour .
but allow me to say clearly that I am wholeheartedly in favour of establishing the principle of humanitarian access in all situations and of reinforcing the right of those in distress to receive humanitarian aid .
let me sincerely congratulate the negotiators who have certain been a homogeneous team , which has acted firmly and calmly , waiting for the right time , and in the end decisively .
I note that the council is also aware that many of the criticisms are the same from one year to the next , and this also encourages me to urge the Council to do something to change this situation .
the central aim of the Baltic Sea Strategy and the Action Programme to improve the region &apos;s environment and competitiveness must be taken seriously in terms of the funding allocated to it and the measures implemented .
we therefore think it is indeed vital for the Council to name a new Commission President as soon as possible , who can appear before Parliament ahead of the elections with a new team .
it has been applied in varying degrees since the 1970s .
this situation really contributes to the fact that , in a prosperous continent such as Europe , between 18 and 20 % of people live in poverty , if we consider that they are below 60 % of the average in their country of origin .
the internal market is of course a splendid and commendable thing but , once in a while , we must also pause and bear some ethical considerations in mind .
small-scale fishing , in particular , is severely affected .
it would be more true to say that women often underestimate their abilities and do not push themselves forward .
however , I believe that precisely the opposite is true , in other words , that better policies justify more money .
one crucial point which needs to be highlighted is that the common position clarifies the fact that this directive needs to take account of Directive 2000 / 31 on electronic commerce , at least as far as the transactions regulated by it are concerned .
at present the average claim processed abroad can take up to eight years and cost at least 15 % more than a claim processed in one &apos;s Member State .
however , I must reject Amendment No 2 , because economic considerations cannot be used as an excuse for watering down the measures needed .
moreover , Thailand has other refugee issues to settle as well , such as the Hmong people from Laos .
it has brought to light a culture of complacency towards irregular practices at the very highest level .
in the judiciary , there has been a growth in transparency , a reduction in the numbers of pending court proceedings and excessively long proceedings .
the European Union must stop propping that regime up but that would mean exchanging principles and values for business .
that is why the big media companies are now rejoicing at this new directive . It will allow them to retain their old technology , and they will not need to change over to more modern technology that would enable consumers to save money .
well , enough of dogmatics .
this should send a strong message to the US Congress , which is currently debating the Shelby bill on the tightening of the Exon-Florio Statute .
the EU should leave Cyprus and Malta alone .
if we fail our citizens in this respect , apathy and their perception of the barrier between the EU institutions and ordinary citizens will grow much bigger .
you will see - because this is not necessarily our last disaster - this request will become increasingly popular in coastal communities .
I hope that this project will not remain on the figurative drawing-board , and that it will be implemented in the context of our relations with Ukraine , Moldova , Georgia , Armenia , Azerbaijan and Belarus .
Mr President , all of us in this House agree , I think , that , just as the Holocaust is to be condemned , the actions or oversights which are the consequences of the Holocaust are similarly to be condemned .
so we have to wonder just how committed the Irish Government is to tackling the problem if it continues to support the Council &apos;s very watered-down amendments .
we must simplify the procedures and trust in the executors .
ladies and gentlemen , if only for money , let us work , let us invest more in safety .
the fact is that , at the moment , it is the complainant who is in the dock .
I have only one thing to say to you in response : my respect for the victims of fascism prevents me from saying a single word about this .
we ought to think about this in connection with the forthcoming Financial Perspective .
cases like Enron or Maxwell must not be allowed to happen again .
finally , we cannot accept Amendment No 4 .
I know that the Dutch Presidency has played a positive role in itself in order to prevent this in part , but I am disappointed greatly with the rest of the Council , where the last Commission proposal was eventually not followed .
lastly , I should be grateful for some answers from the Commissioner to questions which I put some time ago at a special hearing in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs .
it is with these considerations in mind that I have written my report and I have emphasised a number of aspects in this respect .
we know very well that high moral standards , ethics , dignity and clear rules are key .
in the case of dioxin , 15 days passed between the communication of the Standing Veterinary Committee and the official alert , while Commissioner Bonino simply announced that she did not drink Belgian milk .
in this respect , the current Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1964 / 2005 on the tariff rates for bananas , which provides for a duty of EUR 176 per tonne , must be revoked .
now we are having to redefine this policy for the period after 2013 , and we are therefore at a turning point .
Parliament &apos;s report has no answer to the doubts , the fears and the national egotisms .
however , we should be aware that it is difficult to reduce excessive levels in Spain , Greece and Italy , and that it is much more difficult in the countries of southern Europe than in those further north .
the motion &apos;s authors are not as concerned about freedom of the media in Europe as they are of disparaging a civic government that was elected by an overwhelming majority of its country &apos;s people and which has the difficult task of rebuilding a country that suffered badly as a result of mismanagement by the previous socialist government .
that is a significant step towards fairer assessment , and will eventually enable the people who live there to have a better understanding of Europe and of the regulations that we enact , and I get the impression that there is still a desperate need for far better communication between us and the citizens of Europe .
it follows , then , that we must ensure that the haulage firms and the drivers who work for them do not see the rules and the monitoring of them as some sort of bureaucratic harassment , and that we must , rather than allowing people to talk only about the evils of Europe , always turn the conversation round to the added value that will accrue to it through improved road safety .
Mr President , I have not been informed of this , and there is no mention of this in the Minutes .
I was simply asking which they were - nothing more .
a healthy marine environment is crucially important both for life as a whole , and for the quality of our lives .
as a rule , soil contamination has no cross-border impacts , so there is no reason for soil protection to be a task for the European Union ; nor , indeed , does it have any European added value .
it is indeed a noteworthy common position , and the Commission , Parliament , and I must say the Council too have all played their part in arriving at this happy outcome .
on behalf of the S &amp; D Group . - Mr President , my group &apos;s philosophy on Ukraine-European Union relations today could be expressed by the following paraphrase of a famous speech : do not ask what Ukraine could do for the European Union , but ask what the European could do for Ukraine , in order to have in Ukraine a reliable pillar of the European Union project .
of course you are welcome here , Prime Minister , because it is now worth talking about the future of Europe . This is more the case now then ever , because the Treaty is not an end but a new beginning .
cross-border trading is on the table , as is reducing the value of quotas in Member States .
enrolment in education has reached 76 % in Sub-Saharan Africa and 94 % in North Africa .
nevertheless , it is time to be more transparent .
the report contains two points , paragraphs 12.5 and 12.10 , from the opinion of the Committee on Research and Technology , both of which place the rights of the human embryo above those of the individual , in other words the genetic parents .
it is to be hoped that the heated dispute we are witnessing and involved in will not cause a permanent rift in this House .
since the Committee on Budgetary Control proposes the adoption of this discharge , I agree with the rapporteur &apos;s recommendations and am voting for this report .
to the unthinking public , 97 % may sound a lot .
in other words , irrespective of support and investment , the regional differences are growing , although the objective is quite rightly the independent and varied development of the regions .
this is a very important report and fisheries are extremely important to the regions of this Community .
of course .
therefore , before opening the debate on the subject , I would ask you all to rise and observe a minute &apos;s silence in memory of those victims of the tragedy .
the honourable Member will have to wait a little longer before , I hope , we secure the kind of agreement that will give him the satisfaction he seeks this evening .
should this not be made conditional on the disapplication of internationally unacceptable , cruel and unusual punishments such as those I have just referred to ?
conversely , this provides an exemption to the information procedure for GMO exports to a third country , if this third country has already given approval to another country for the import of the same GMO .
how are the location of production , and hence employment and income , affected by the decoupling of payments and their being linked to environmental requirements – an attempt at riding two horses , in giving the market a greater role in determining farmers ’ incomes while rewarding with public funds services that are no longer in demand ?
for instance , the index measuring the failure rate is only 6 % , whereas in institutions or similar projects the failure rate is between 30 and 50 % .
as my German friends tell me , it is .
what we need is , if I might use the English phrase , a &apos; nice treaty in Nice &apos; , and I am counting on you .
well , in fact , we all know that what is found in a rule can be used against Parliament as an institution , and not against third parties .
all in all , we have here a solid package that will hopefully enable us to create some scope for the sector to develop .
I welcome the Spanish Presidency &apos;s comments about productive systems and a focus on competitiveness .
only in this way is it possible to protect them from the dangers they face , namely fires , which are the principle reason for their destruction .
however , the timing of the sentencing a month earlier than expected and without apparent regard for the defence case presented in the closing day of the trial , and the severity of the sentences - 7 years for Ibrahim and lesser but nonetheless heavy sentences for all the accused - were entirely unexpected and quite disturbing .
users will have access to information that was previously kept internally .
Parliament is not altogether without blame either , of course .
with this in mind , I would like to appeal most earnestly for the headquarters of the Institute ( the Governing Board ) to be located in my country , Poland - in Wrocław .
should the scientists put forward new recommendations in this matter , we should obviously be more than ready to examine these recommendations accordingly as well .
in principle , though , it is able to accept delay to a limited extent .
my proposals on improved living conditions are aimed first and foremost at ensuring better animal care but also at giving consumers greater confidence in European veal .
it is in that area that the EU can make considerable efforts in the cause of peace .
our aim is to have it draw on the ideas and experience of the many , not the few .
this whole programme must be treated as a matter of utmost importance and urgency for the restoration of basic social facilities for millions of people in dozens of countries .
it will therefore be up to us - to you and to us - to ensure the proper implementation of these mechanisms in order to protect the European economy in the event of distortions of competition .
they are employing people at a fifth of the normal wage , until 10 p.m. , on Sundays , and they hardly pay any taxes into the Polish Government ’ s coffers .
secondly , we must equip ourselves with a binding agreement that states that greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced by 30 % by 2020 , and by 80 % by 2050 .
some examples will illustrate my point .
the prospect of such a decision and the legal security that it brings allow the Commission to engage the third country concerned in discussions about the protection provided , and hold it to ensuring a high standard .
this approach reflects practices in other parts of the world .
at any rate , Latvia , the state I represent in the European Parliament , cannot talk about complete isolation , since it has a common gas market shared with two other EU Member States and a gas storage facility that supplies the region .
to put it another way , these traditional appellations may be freely used with reference to other quality wines .
( RO ) Mr President , I do not think either that it is fair for us to talk in general about a 10-year period which Member States would have had available .
indeed , it appears extremely appropriate to consider taxing the use of vehicles rather than their acquisition , and the Commission is , therefore , right to propose abolishing the vehicle registration tax and establishing or increasing taxes on circulation , fuel and the use of some road infrastructures .
2 . Request for consultation of the Committee of the Regions - Citizens initiative ( vote )
Mr President , creative and innovative activities will be critical to the development of the information society .
I must admit that I refer to those incidents with great regret , since we have to recognise that the host country made an enormous effort in organising the summit , which itself brought about a very positive outcome for the EU in the important field of the future of internet governance .
the Member States must be free to protect their citizens .
we , as MEPs , should look upon this year &apos;s Peace Prize as a challenge and a task .
now , the state of affairs is more shocking .
as far as the textile and clothing sector is concerned , the scene for what is happening today was set a decade ago .
yet again , the rapporteur has resorted to drawing up a blacklist of countries in which the usual suspects are attacked and the most powerful evade criticism .
I also want our Latvian colleagues to comment on the matter so that we obtain a debate , for the vessel was on the way from Latvia to Gibraltar .
I say this for good reason , as statistical data are often the basis for important decisions taken both at local and regional as well as at national , European and even world level .
however , I , along with colleagues who have investigated this matter , believe that it needs proper consideration .
because of the complexity and uncertainty , I proposed at the end of 1995 the launching of a new initiative on social protection which I called the framework for a European debate on the future of social protection .
unlike the European right , which spoke out very strongly in favour of opening negotiations on the conclusion of a free trade agreement , I defended a more cautious approach .
we need to have broadband penetration , and we need to have more than a given percentage of the population using whatever kinds of tools they use to enjoy e-commerce , which is usually the internet .
more supervision nationally - supervision by national governments of national banks - and internationally , for example by means of the IMF .
in general , I am a great defender of cultural diversity but not in terms of competitiveness within the internal market .
I would like to mention the principle of proportionate representation , the incompatibility of the membership of national parliaments with that of the European Parliament , a cut in the expenses for campaigns , probably to avoid hold-ups involving multimillionaires from our Parliament .
recovery plans must seek a balance between the recovery and conservation of stocks and measures to limit the impact on the fishing industry .
of course the Commission has no way of enforcing respect for these directives . There is no provision for sanctions .
you clearly give us no alternative but to reject this agreement , and you are not making our life any easier .
I would also like to underline the need for consistency within the action taken by the service with regard to administrative and budget responsibilities and on this point , of course , relations with the Commission , on the one hand , and with Parliament , on the other , are crucial .
 
it just carries on regardless .
that is the point of the amendment that Mr Florenz and I have put forward .
two final remarks .
whilst the world is watching the revolt in the Arab world , Iran continues to repress dissidents .
that is precisely why this Court is so important .
as carriers , ships are subject to so many constraints , and face so much competition , that safety often gets left behind .
Mr President , thank you for staying up so late .
( DE ) My group supports the report by Mr Turco , who has done good work .
this is another good reason to expedite these structural reforms .
lastly , special priority should be given to securing the energy needs of the islands by developing and implementing power generation projects based on new technologies and renewable energy sources .
the reality is that judicial authorities in various Member States have differing views on what constitutes a serious offence .
we must state clearly here , as already stated in the Kyoto Protocol , that these must be additional and not exclusive measures . We also need clear indications of how emissions trading will be monitored and measured .
this is reserved for the Commission .
I mentioned briefly that the structural funds merely cofinance programmes by means of advances from the budget .
firstly , the reduction of the prevalence of HIV-AIDS - a disease that has reduced life expectancy in sub-Saharan Africa from 62 to 47 years - is an absolutely essential target .
however , we need a new approach to climate change that takes its impact on security , economic recovery , immigration and even combating terrorism into account .
besides imposing new obligations on the industry in the form of environmental requirements , we also need to give it simplified procedures , to cut red tape and to apply the principles of better lawmaking .
and time is short , because the spawning season starts in the middle of this month .
I have taken note of your words ; this is something which we all feel very deeply .
an ex-post assessment of the agreement shows that it is relevant in that it helps to maintain the presence of EU fleets in the region while contributing to local job creation .
in the light of the financial controller &apos;s decision , the institution must then assume its responsibilities in order to rectify the situation that has arisen , including the settlement of any legitimate claims by third parties .
after a rather bumpy journey from Durban , we now have a solid declaration and programme of action - a welcome development which we must now put to good use .
if these parties try to use this alliance to carve up the way things are done in this House , my group will fight them every inch of the way .
we talked about the importance of the Commission developing a series of headline goals for non-military actions related to crises and , if I may say so , if ever there was a case where that is relevant , it is the disaster which has overwhelmed Mozambique .
it would share the loss more fairly between Greek taxpayers and external creditors ; stop the replacement of private debt by an ever-growing proportion of official debt coming from other countries ; offer Greece more growth opportunities by alleviating debt service ; make it much easier for Mrs Merkel to &apos; sell &apos; the default to the Bundestag , because it would mean supporting German banks rather than Greece ; and , finally , isolate the debt crisis from the competitiveness crisis and save the eurozone from contagion .
statements by the President
these EU-funded projects will thus contribute to the development of the information society .
surely this is unacceptable in transatlantic relations .
I therefore doubt whether an agreement on the readmission of refugees would really work .
first , the Commission ’ s handling of the Hoechst / Rhône-Poulenc merger in 1999 and 2004 has been discussed at length and in detail during the committee meetings when this report was being prepared .
in the report by Mr Feio , there is a proposal on establishing a European monetary fund .
basically , we can only reaffirm our rejection of this kind of funding , which will cost the taxpayer a lot of money and only provide minimal resources for European parties which have no real substance .
I will now turn to the individual amendments .
what is needed is for the sector to be compensated for the economic and social consequences of this break in fishing , and there should be a Community compensation fund specifically for this purpose .
please believe me - and know this as a result of holding this post - that he , Julian , and his fellow workers are the real architects of the day-to-day miracle that keeps this complex institution operating .
if we want to be consistent , these gains are necessary , and they are possible as well .
the WTO is not only an economic but also a political institution , which is why trust among members is important .
this plan was drawn up for a Ukraine from a different age , before the ‘ Orange Revolution ’ took place , offering hope and a model for peaceful political transformation .
although this report is primarily technical in nature and deals with the possible improvement in vendor controls in duty-free trade , its political background - the abolition of duty-free goods sales on travel routes within the EU from 1999 onwards - cannot be denied , and I would firmly reject this .
in practice , when an ordinary citizen travels , he is forced to part with a commission .
what progress has the Commission made to date in its exercise to identify and recommit dormant EDF resources for ACP countries to the Fast Track Initiative ( FTI ) ?
we must reject this proposal .
you need to take action . Please do not attempt to improve communication about what you are not doing !
as a Member representing one of the countries that recently joined the European Union , I am particularly concerned about the proposals to impose penalties on companies transferring all or part of their activities to those parts of the Union where the production costs are lower .
the Committee on Legal Affairs was broadly united in supporting the proposal that consumers should be entitled to redeem electronic money .
a resolution has been adopted thanks to the efforts by France and the United Kingdom .
a number of colleagues have sought to reintroduce a very restrictive deadline on the use of supernumerary embryos , which is a very serious problem .
it would have been possible for the Irish to vote for a stronger , more competitive European Union , one that served the Member States &apos; interests more than before .
the rail freight market must now tackle the challenges posed in improving the quality of the services provided due to the lack of compliance , which is a handicap when competing with other forms of freight transport .
I think that mobility should also concern them and we must find a way of involving them in all European programmes concerned education and youth .
bearing in mind the technological and scientific advances achieved since then , and pursuant to the conclusions of the European Council in Brussels in December 1993 , it was appropriate to revise this directive , hence today &apos;s debate and vote .
on behalf of the PPE Group , I would like to ask the President of the Commission to give us an appraisal of whether the Commission - and , above all , Frontex - has enough resources , whether we , the European Union , have enough capabilities to respond on the ground , and whether we have enough statutory bases to enable Europe to act together in the Mediterranean region .
secondly , on financial compensation , what do we mean ?
I should particularly like to single out progress in the field of cleaner water , hygiene and the prevention of diseases .
why , in fact , do we put up with a state of affairs in which the only ones that get talked about are France and the Netherlands ?
to this end , the Austrian Council Presidency organised a conference that was held in mid-April in St. Pölten , Austria , with the title ‘ Europe begins at home ’ .
my request is therefore that the two coordination processes be synchronised as fully as possible so that they then make it possible to fulfil not only Lisbon but the Stability Pact too .
our amendments are constructive ones , and we hope that they will help the Commission to fine-tune its proposal in an effort to gain the support of the Member States .
unfortunately , the opposition votes meant that the Croatian parliament adopted this proposal by the government .
oral amendments require the acceptance of the groups and this group is opposed .
the people of Europe have repeatedly been told that from 1 January 1999 the mark , the franc , the lira , the peseta and so on will be united to form the euro , and will become non-decimal fractions of the euro .
and I would remind him that his report has not been approved unanimously , as he has said here .
however , we also have doubts on the necessity and proportionality of European data retention provisions .
it was a great eye-opener for me and has remained with me throughout my life .
the problem clearly lay in the insufficient availability of manpower .
every 20 minutes , a woman dies of breast cancer in Europe .
this text , which , in the end , takes neither side in the debate , only warrants a vote of abstention .
this report is a series of revisions of a 2002 law that was adopted in the aftermath of the attacks of 11 September 2001 .
it is in the same spirit that we must now also do what is needed following the liberating enlargement to 25 Union partners .
third , I think we need a little more public debate on enlargement and , certainly , on public defence .
the rapporteur is right to go for a strict budgetary policy .
because of the increased media interest by extremist groups , the false generalisations and distorted half-truths that are expressed more widely than before are not only unacceptable but extremely dangerous , since they strengthen incidents of prejudice and negative discrimination and further impede the resolution of social problems .
firstly , the current political situation in Afghanistan is unstable .
under pressure elsewhere , and distracted by its own social problems , the European Union is unable to increase or even maintain the total volume of aid it provides .
I have been very pleased to see the great interest which Parliament has shown in this subject , and I share the opinion of the rapporteur , Mr Florenz , and also Mr White , that constructive cooperation has taken place .
in this context - and here I am only taking up something that is mentioned time and again - it is very important that we look after the rights of persons with reduced mobility in particular .
we really would be well-advised , therefore , to approach the matter with some measure of humility . We can offer our services , but we should be careful not to adopt a didactic approach all the time .
reproduction seed is not subject to any mandatory quality testing and is not therefore tested for the presence of GMOs .
three vehicles were prohibited from continuing their journey .
we are talking about human rights , about people , and we are talking about people not on the other side of the world , but on the other side of society .
well , equally harsh mandatory measures must be taken against employers who refuse to employ disabled people or who do not adapt the workplace as necessary .
but on 25 March I came across a new point in a Dutch newspaper which is on the one hand very interesting , but on the other extremely alarming .
fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome are not the only diseases that mostly affect women .
one opposition party is currently saying that the agreement is a partial agreement , an agreement that can only be observed provided the Fatos Nano government nullifies all the measures it has taken since it came to power .
unfortunately , the fact that we are holding yet another debate on this issue would suggest not .
it is precisely restrictions of this nature that foment illegal work and the exploitation of workers .
as recently as 1991 and 1992 the Commission won a battle with the UK over additionality , at that time linked to the RECHAR funding .
Wednesday :
in terms of facts and the political consequences that we should be drawing from this , it is almost irrelevant whether there have been two or three renditions as we were told in the US by the US Administration , or whether the facts unearthed so far reveal two or three renditions , or whether we have found more .
that is our task and that is what we must focus on : no more and no less .
the report is especially good news for many of the old Member States , and I am glad to see that old EU Member States will now be allowed to utilise a proportion of ERDF funds for interventions which promote energy efficiency in the housing sector .
today the people of Europe no longer understand and , in particular , will no longer tolerate unjustified closures of companies and the lack of solidarity between the Member States of the Union .
coming from a new Member State , this scaremongering seems like déjà vu .
we therefore also need an effective Commission that will take on this role .
the Union must work in partnership with the region to this end , to help to meet all of these challenges .
specific protection must be given to individuals , children and women especially .
eighty-five per cent of the best brains go to America and Australia , put off by our bureaucracy , our bloody-mindedness and our barriers to free movement .
this is important for freedom of expression and diversity , a question which is often debated in this House .
ladies and gentlemen , some years ago the United States and the European Union both declared that they would not recognise the independence of Kosovo .
be vigilant in your work and I wish the Dutch Presidency every success .
we need to know what is desired .
Mrs Ţicău , in the first part of my speech just now , which was quite short as per the rules , I myself mentioned one of the major challenges , other than mobility , which is that of demography .
then we shall be on the right path and Mr Kouchner must also be a little more effective than he is at the moment , whoever may be hampering him in carrying out his task .
the fact of the matter that we now have to consider , coolly , if we now have to go to the WTO - which is likely and which I have always favoured , in any event - is indeed one of the lessons to be learnt from the negotiation that took place in the OECD .
I therefore propose combating this monopoly situation with the means provided by and the authority of the Commission , along with the enforcement of the Charter on Freedom of the Press , backed up by European authority .
there are problems , Madam President , but I appreciate that you , Mr Priestley and the group who dealt with the complaints from the last session recognise them .
first , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Bowis , on his report .
on this matter , I believe that the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs forcefully lays down some points for reflection that Parliament must consider further .
on the institutional side , the fact that the European Parliament was able to put forward its proposals on the spot , for the very first time since GATT came into being , strengthens our role in the general decision-making of the Union .
therefore , a démarche of the Czech EU Presidency and the French Union for the Mediterranean Co-Presidency , on behalf of the EU members of the Union for the Mediterranean , possibly together with the Egyptian Co-Presidency , addressed to our Arab partners , is just being prepared .
we are in favour , however , of the proposal to set up an inquiry into the development of new methods for funding major infrastructure projects of common European interest .
but it also means better exchange of information between the parties concerned , so that blacklists of both fishing and fish transport vessels can be disseminated and the possibility of converting to a white list through reflagging can be avoided .
I am heartily sickened to read the passages about how many millions are to be aside for bodies that are – to quote the jargon – &apos; active at European level &apos; or &apos; information relays &apos; .
on the basis of the principle that &apos; particularly where a major part of retirement provision is already provided by a pay-as-you-go system it is necessary to encourage additional contributions to retirement provision based on capital formation &apos; , the proposal for a directive is intended to facilitate the further expansion of occupational pensions as the second pillar of retirement provision , a Europe-wide organised internal market , which must contribute to greater efficiency , transparency and security within the second pillar .
I keenly support the demand made in the report for 2010 to be declared as the European Year of Fryderyk Chopin , given that it is the 200th anniversary of the birth of this composer of genius , who made an incontrovertible contribution to European and world culture .
however , we fundamentally disagree with the premise of this report which , in effect , states that further enlargement can only proceed successfully if the European Constitution comes into force .
where will that money come from ?
on the other hand , the European Parliament has repeatedly declared the need for greater use of renewables , and adopted the correct decisions and recommendations , only for little to change .
very importantly , there are attempts to impose European prohibitions on ethical aspects of research and therapy which are clearly the subject of the subsidiarity principle and which it must remain the right of Member States to decide .
Madam President , first of all , the Presidency Minutes are sent to every Member .
we want to keep open the channels for dialogue with Israel .
that said , I would like to express our group &apos;s support for the call for the Council to try to define an EU position on this issue .
that little tablet forms part of a specific youth culture , whose motto is that it is nice to let your hair down at the weekend , as long as you are up early again on Monday .
to close , I should like to add that the European Union , and especially the European Commission , must lay down strict conditionality mechanisms in the new development strategy formulated for Africa .
the next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
of all the measures proposed in the report under discussion , there is particular significance in the proposal to define minimum income in relation to median income .
this is the situation which has been maintained and clearly , sensu contrario , the interpretation must be that neither the Central Bank nor the Council nor , of course , we in the Commission , are in favour of &apos; euroisation &apos; processes which in some cases have been suggested and which , in our view , in no event should allow entry to the euro through the back door or allow countries which do not fulfil the conditions set for all Member States of the European Union to benefit from the advantages of being in the euro legally .
let us remind people of the way in which democracy triumphed over dictatorship and oppression was exchanged for freedom .
Mr Falconer , I do not think that we should carry on with comments on dress code , but I am not convinced of the accuracy of what you have said . There are others who wear suits like those you mentioned .
the next item is the report by Fernand Le Rachinel , on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation ( EC ) No 417 / 2002 on the accelerated phasing-in of double-hull or equivalent design requirements for single-hull oil tankers and repealing Council Regulation ( EC ) No 2978 / 94 C6-0104 / 2006 .
I know that this is not in your interests , but it is in ours .
I think my colleagues were quite right in what they said on specific steps for the future , that is , on opening the opportunity for a free trade zone , on the visa regime .
I want to make that very clear .
the EU is known around the world as a champion of human rights , at the same time it is China ’ s most important trading partner .
I have on previous occasions in this House drawn attention to these deficiencies : I did so on 7 April 2003 and 13 May 2003 , and in questions to the Commission in 2003 and 2004 .
- Before the vote on Amendment 4
we support the provisions of the Charter of Rights and we also support the second part of the amendment which safeguards the right to industrial disputes .
bans are not the right method ; instead we need incentives , we need to give support for the airlines to move towards reducing emissions by using modern fleets that use less kerosene and also produce less pollution .
Madam President , I just asked to speak to put it on record that I am amazed by the fact that , with a budget of ECU 90 , 000 million and with 500 amendments presented , separate votes have only been requested on one point .
the European Parliament , in this context , is obviously a very important stakeholder in the EU economic governance reform .
my proposals also concern the matter of whether it is normal for a member of Commission staff - not including their annual holiday entitlement , note - to have up to seven weeks paid time off , and this for all those earning more than EUR 10 000 net per month .
Mr Swoboda has already said it , and I can repeat it for my own group : we will agree to these four legislative reports being carried over to the September part-session or to a part-session in Brussels .
. – I voted against the Laschet report on the draft European Constitution , which has not yet been adopted , in order to highlight the Brussels institutions ’ long-standing foreign policy ambitions , which involve making the European Union into a fully-fledged international actor ‘ as soon as its legal personality is recognised by the Constitution ’ ( paragraph 10 ) , which amounts to making it an international partner equivalent to a state and with all the characteristics of one , including even permanent membership of the UN .
we are looking forward to the Gothenburg Summit and hope that a great many citizens will be there under the alternative arrangements .
the situation in Burma is similar to those in Chile and South Africa in the 1980s , and in my view the opposition leader in Burma is the Mandela of the 1990s .
the agenda we have sketched out in the 2020 strategy , the consultation paper that the Commission circulated yesterday .
our group and also our party - the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats - is , as we have now confirmed at our congress , quite clear about the timeframe involved .
this is a continuation of the previous explanation of vote , Mr President .
the difficult internal situation is a challenge to the Union to set out a practical course of engagement for resolving the crisis , which might as such have wider implications for Europe .
the Commission , it seems , does not require this .
we should all support this tomorrow .
the future of Europe is our common problem , equally important for the young and the elderly , for men and women .
nevertheless , let us not go too far by making Parliament the seat of a future &apos; government of the parties &apos; .
during the approval process I was happy to accept any amendment proposals that coincided with these aims , and that is why I supported the idea of including statistical regions in the category under Article 87 ( 3 ) ( a ) for the provision of relevant state aid to all regions with natural handicaps or disadvantages that make it impossible for them to initiate development , or regions that have for various reasons fallen into the group of poor areas , as well as proposals restricting the destructive relocation of enterprises receiving state aid , and others . I was also happy to add proposals requesting that the criteria for determining the entitlement to state aid for individual regions and firms be defined as precisely as possible , and I expect the Commission to make a thorough assessment of the negative impacts of inappropriately provided aid and to draw the appropriate conclusions .
so , in this respect , my warmest thanks to the Commission .
this is evidence of efficiency , better economy and Community preference .
that is why , in our view , this policy , as set out in the present report , merely adds fuel to the fire raging in the Balkans and offers encouragement to the grand unification plans of the Albanian nationalists .
it is important that we retain this determination and that , through coordination and implementation , Europe will be able not only to respond to the challenge internally but also to make an important contribution to the global response to this crisis of very great dimensions .
thank you very much , Commissioner .
closure of the sitting
I believe it is important for the European Union to have a better overview of how the governments of the Member States implement the Small Business Act .
so be a little bit patient .
another issue is that of secularism and respect for religion .
we took care that we did not , as we had done in the past , fight to put plenty of money in the Budget lines – as we had done with the last , 700 billion , perspective – only to end up with the actual expenditure totalling just over 550 billion ; what matters , then , is the quality of the expenditure , and that is why we insisted on making headway on the Budget Regulation front , making things less bureaucratic , less tangled .
needless to say , nothing has happened in secret .
none of this affects passengers , since the measures taken towards reducing CO2 will increase the ticket price for routes within Europe by a sum of no more than approximately EUR 1 .
that is just not the case , the reality on the ground often does not match the aims of the legislative framework , and further urgent action is very necessary to ensure that all our citizens have access to travel .
although I agree with Mr Mladenov and Mr Tannock that the abduction and failure to allow family visits of Israeli nationals is an equal breach of international law , I regret that Mr Tannock sought to portray my co-author , Mrs Morgantini , as someone who is committed to the destruction of Israel , when she and I support human rights and upholding international humanitarian law .
the environmental damage caused by accidents like this does not stop at the borders of a country or two , or of a continent , but endangers and will ultimately destroy irrevocably our common values and our common natural treasures .
European action in the form of sanctions can indeed have positive value if it brings a real improvement in the human rights situation in the relevant partner country .
Mr President , in the absence of Mr Reul , I will repeat this question that we are putting to the Commission .
in addition , we will try to prevent and minimise the risks of repeat offending and introduce measures to ensure the optimum effectiveness of safety mechanisms in the entire Union .
I wish you a happy Christmas in redrafting the Rules .
I wish to sincerely thank all those whose cooperation in conciliation led to our success at the end of last year .
as you know , Mr Colom i Naval and myself attended the Council meeting last Monday and since the Council wants to be transparent it is my duty to report on what we heard .
firstly , I believe the European Union must spearhead the international community ’ s effort to attain that objective .
on Amendment No 10
that is why we support it .
72 % of the reprogramming required is due to delays in rural development programmes .
as no motion to reject the common position has been tabled and there are no amendments , I declare the common position approved .
we are ready to operate at Rafah , or at any other crossing points where help is needed or requested .
finally , for the EQF to be complete and effective , it will also be necessary for the economic partners , the professional branches , to understand and appropriate it for themselves .
the efforts of the Commission and the Council have merely served to hold back the process of transformation in Belarus , as nearly six months have passed since Parliament ’ s resolution on the matter , and precisely nothing has happened .
this being the case , the Committee on Budgets stated that the framework was compatible with the ceiling of heading 3 , if necessary through a reduction of other policies or through recourse to the provisions of the interinstitutional agreement .
admittedly , reforming operational methods is but one side of the coin ; what is especially crucial is that the International Monetary Fund should have adequate financial resources .
in addition , there are air-traffic links with 90 countries that are not internationally recognised to be free of foot-and-mouth disease and infection .
– Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , where this issue of an appeal to the European Court of Justice is concerned , the Group of the European People ’ s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats is being entirely pragmatic in its approach .
 
I hope that , following this tragedy , all of this will be strengthened and that we will be able to make further progress and prevent any more tragedies such as the Erika or the Prestige .
many factors speak in favour of increased use of biofuels .
for 40 years we have been unable to achieve it , but I believe that with this excellent , meticulous report by Mr Anastassopoulos we will be able to establish common principles for elections to the European Parliament , even before the Treaty of Amsterdam comes into force .
in the meantime , we need to confront a factor that signifies permanent insecurity , namely the subversive endeavours of Russian superpower policy .
the vote will take place this morning at 11 a.m.
I was even somewhat surprised to hear Mrs Ghilardotti mention consumer safety .
we all know that we have spoken many warm words over the years , but I have seen what goes on behind the scenes in developing countries – EU tomato paste and American rice dumped on the markets of Ghana and some of the poorest countries in Africa .
firstly : the Ludford report flouts and violates the underlying principle of subsidiarity by calling in points 4 , 6 , 27 second indent , 11 and 20 for measures such as the recruitment of third country nationals to public office or formal requirements to change curricula and teacher training programmes .
the only thing I can confirm is that it is the responsibility of the Member States to enter personal data into the Schengen Information System .
the lessons I have learnt throughout this process are that we need better budgeting and improved planning processes .
European graduates must have strong skills that are suitable for employment and they must have easy access to highly important programmes such as Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs and for Apprentices .
in the case of BSE , the fact is that the very high officials who have escaped unpunished , as the Commission wanted , are not the only people to blame .
we must send a clear message to the US administration : we are prepared to cooperate in the fight against terrorism but provided that the rule of law is adhered to .
and however we might try to explain this , the fact remains that there is a gap to be bridged .
now it thinks it sees a threat in the form of an EU regulation which it does not like and calls upon us to vote no to an additional declaration of animal fat in connection with the product name .
to conclude , the Commission has undertaken to participate actively with the Member States in the negotiations on the United Nations Convention .
it is not designed for that purpose .
amongst other things , the need to identify and tear down barriers to equal pay could be highlighted .
France is stepping up its precautionary measures for specified at-risk materials and is implementing an extensive protocol to evaluate ESB tests on bovine animals .
 
as a member of the Committee on Education and Culture , I believe that the development of volunteer programmes concerning solidarity between generations and the involvement of government , private enterprise and individuals is a key point for taking up the new challenges posed by demographic change , poverty and social exclusion .
now , an attempt is being made to get rid of this solidarity by means of a bad piece of EU legislation .
Mr Bushill-Matthews , you are aware , of course , that monitoring of the proper transposition of EU legislation by Member States is the responsibility of the European Commission in the first instance .
the Union has acquired legal personality , and the longed-for disappearance of the pillar structure has become a reality .
there is a delivery gap and we are not doing as well as we ought to .
of course , the formal aspects of the meeting need to be revised . This could perhaps be done in conjunction with the UN overhaul in September .
the next item is the report ( A4-0384 / 96 ) by Mr Rehder , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on the Commission study on alternative strategies for the development of relations in the field of agriculture between the EU and the associated countries with a view to future accession of these countries ( Agricultural Strategy Paper ) ( CSE ( 95 ) 0607 - C4-0023 / 96 ) .
we have to remember , Mr Prodi , that when this Parliament has looked at this problem of a food agency in the past , we have not been absolutely sure about whether this is the right way forward .
to be fair , the Commission does talk about the necessary shift of traffic from the roads .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I find it difficult to talk about the European Parliament &apos;s budget today without referring to the striking confirmation in the most recent report from the Court of Auditors on the reimbursements and allowances which we receive as Members of the European Parliament .
Mrs Ahern , please put your question .
among other things , it has unlawfully disbanded or had disbanded nearly every single street demonstration .
but it will be an absolute scandal if the European Parliament is not in a position to present a report to the summit .
I would also like to express my appreciation for the very positive role which Parliament has played in the course of these negotiations through the political debates .
another environmental issue which we feel needs attention but which I am afraid is no longer part of the programme is PVC , a material which is recognised to be highly dangerous by at least five Commission ongoing studies .
Mr President , I just wish to say that the Irish delegation and my colleagues in the PPE-DE Group voted in favour of this report .
but , in the view of the Council at this moment in time , for the reasons I have stated , we do not see a role for the Council in triggering the Moscow mechanism .
it was for precisely this reason that I chose to table an amendment to the report , explicitly calling on Member States to update their legislation on the use of the Internet by minors , in particular by introducing the offence of grooming , as defined by the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse , of October 2007 .
we will shortly be discussing Iraq and the failure of the approach according to which international crises and conflicts can be resolved by pre-emptive strikes . To be consistent , though , we then have to say that such crises are no better dealt with by nullifying the democratic system , by abolishing the rule of law , or by reintroducing authoritarian structures .
these socially pernicious effects should have been corrected in this reform .
conditions in Zimbabwe are appalling .
the objectives , the road maps and the various policies set out in this regard by the European Union institutions are good and adequate , I believe , and the goals are as ambitious as they need to be .
the European Commission will focus on securing strong EU implementation of the two EU-wide partnerships on water and energy launched in Johannesburg .
I understand that , taking into consideration the implementation of the amended Regulation on social security schemes ( at present the 1971 Regulation is still in force ) , we are trying only to change that which it is necessary to change and to adapt it to the changes that have been introduced in certain countries .
as far as Sweden is concerned the matter has by no means been decided .
all sides have their shortcomings and we in this House must continue to encourage where necessary , and criticise where necessary .
now we will concentrate on the subject of implementation of the new treaty and fundamental rights .
I do not , I think , need to mention the lack of medical care or the destruction of schools and public institutions , which is significantly hindering the establishment of order and a return to normality .
( LV ) Thank you , Mr President .
at the same time , the Helsinki Committee is warning that Ukraine is breaching the European Convention on Human Rights .
Madam President , I would first of all like to thank both rapporteurs .
but it is not appropriate for us to set the deadline for the resolution before the debate and before the President of the Commission has had an opportunity to respond .
that is not the point .
the UN &apos; s Secretary-General has also commented on what happened and said , &apos; Obviously , the timing is a bit awkward for the talks I am going to have on 26 February &apos; .
the amendments were then adopted thanks to the votes of the Latin-American parliamentarians .
Article 179 is not able to cover the broad spectrum of development and economic cooperation .
this partly explains why we are so often overtaken by events .
the Bosniaks are the only people in Bosnia who have not been allowed to travel freely throughout Europe .
I bring brotherly greetings to Mrs Nurit Peled-Elhanan and Mr Izzat Ghazzawi , the couple with whom I share this honour .
our thanks , in any case , go to Mr Fiori : we believe that his is an important piece of work , especially if our major amendments are accepted ; it will be a good basis for reflection from now onwards and for preventing major discoveries from becoming patented property for the use and consumption of the powerful rather than being placed at the service of all human kind .
the euro will also put an end to currency fluctuations , and on this point I share many of the concerns expressed this morning .
I note that the Minutes give no reason for the postponement of that report .
nor should we forget that they are an integral part of the internal market and European nationality .
when I use the words &apos; colleagues &apos; or &apos; comrades &apos; , I do so because I myself have been a member of a voluntary fire-fighting organisation in Austria for decades and so absolutely do feel sympathy and empathy for the efforts made .
let us not forget , however , that this may harm European companies in cases where foreign competitors are preferred .
when quota restrictions are constantly being imposed on the production of basic mountain agricultural and livestock products , a problem which is particularly acute for southern products which cannot be replaced by others in the primary sector for reasons related to soil and climate , it is impossible to keep people and especially young people in those areas because of the lack of jobs , adequate incomes and a decent standard of living .
not that Russians refuse the cultural trappings of the West , because President Putin has spoken time and again of his country &apos;s place at the cultural heart of Europe .
can we ask ourselves the question as to whether Europe wants more ?
as Irish republicans , following in the tradition of Bobby Sands MP , we are committed to the politics of equality , justice and freedom .
combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography is vitally important .
– Mr President , it is a positive move that the General Affairs Council signalled collectively that the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and Russia should automatically extend to cover the new Member States .
the last time this exercise was carried out , in 2000 , the data were available only in 2005 and thus were of questionable validity .
Parliament rejected the request for referral back to committee
but as this question is important to our negotiating partners , the Commission and the Member States are currently working on it with the Presidentin-Office in Brussels .
Mr President , we might call today &apos; s sitting a sitting in celebration of human rights .
I ask you to adopt my report , on which no amendments have been tabled .
I think that we should vote for the joint text that is before us , emphasising that it is absolutely essential that the letter and the spirit should be fully respected .
my esteemed fellow MEP , Timothy Kirkhope , justified it on the basis of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and by reference to data protection &apos;s significance .
I would like to take this opportunity to urge the Commission to do everything it can to put an end to this situation and to allow the work on the report to continue and to complete the parliamentary procedure so that we can establish clear , simple and effective rules for this market and clear up the uncertainty currently faced by organic producers .
not until December 1995 was the Commission able to sign the corresponding contracts with the intermediate financing institutions and , as the honourable Member will be aware , agreeing on the composition of the partnership committee for Northern Ireland and the regional partnerships was also far from easy .
we must ensure respect for the principle that third-country production methods for export to the EU must provide European consumers with the same guarantees in terms of health , food safety , animal welfare , sustainable development and minimum social standards as those required of EU producers .
I therefore believe that safety should be the only consideration governing the deadlines . No other reason is sufficiently powerful to be allowed to delay liberalisation of the railways .
in the present situation - let us be quite clear - the Council is totally unable to adopt a position on this matter , and still less so to oblige the Commission to disclose the report in question , even if only to the Swedish Government .
all this work is in progress , and that is why I am very eager today to hear the views of Members of this House .
I am actually called Theato , but I was not present either .
the 2005 EU action plan on best practices , standards and procedures launched by the Council contains a very ambitious array of measures to fight trafficking in human beings .
I hope that next time , also if any other airline company is involved , things will run more smoothly .
as of today , 134 people have lost their lives on Irish roads since the beginning of this year .
the reality is that landmines are still being used .
we must encourage the adoption of single , integrated maritime governance structures at regional level and the development of strategies for the Union &apos;s maritime macro-regions .
I have to say that my group and I were deeply disappointed , and extremely vexed frankly , to see that in the run-up to this debate , the media twisted the words in the report , the result running counter to a number of central points .
inevitably it is not for the Council itself to give discharge on the budget ; but it is relevant that it should offer comments which we as a Parliament can not only receive but also read in time and understand .
by the end of this year , the Commission will have adopted a European disabilities strategy for the years 2010-20 , which will set out a coherent framework for implementing the UN Convention on the rights of persons with disability .
Mr President , the Committee on External Economic Relations unanimously agreed to support Mr Wiersma &apos;s report and thus the Interim Agreement , because it considers that it would not only be wrong but also very dangerous to isolate Uzbekistan at a time of serious crisis .
I would like to say to you , with the greatest of respect , that there were certain governments in the past , during the dictatorships , that massacred the people .
what perhaps is just as vital as this need for rapid communication and coordination is for citizens to be trained and educated to protect themselves .
we can also accept amendment No 2 to the title which introduces a reference to the Dublin Convention .
Iceland &apos;s Parliament also takes this view as , in contrast to other Scandinavian countries , it has allowed its Law on registered partnerships to include joint custody of children .
it has taken nine years to get this legislation .
for fifteen years , the states have shrunk back from the abrogation of sovereignty that the transfer of such rights to the European Union represents , and I can understand why they do , for it involves , to a degree , the surrender of national power , but this surrender of a bit of power must be weighed against the prospect of migration , people-trafficking , uncontrolled immigration and the problems associated with them being allowed to drag on even longer .
first of all , we must examine the issue of independence , because if it is true that banks and certain investor groups are financing the fees of the evaluations , we might ask the question whether the decisions of credit rating agencies are indeed free of external interests .
however convincing the industry &apos;s arguments may be now , they will look pretty weak in years to come .
in order to enhance the reliability of supplies , it is also necessary to enter into agreements with other countries .
it is now a punishable offence to insult &apos; the Turkish nation &apos; , rather than &apos; insulting Turkishness &apos; .
however , this strategy takes a diametrically opposite approach .
by the time of the elections next March hundreds if not thousands of Salvadorans will once again have lost their life .
in order to continue the policy of reform in Georgia , further peaceful , political solutions to the conflict in Abkhazia must be found .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , the power and the importance of the MDGs come from being a collective commitment to shared development goals .
the aid is conveyed to its destination entirely by European NGOs , and those NGOs are required to ensure that the goods do actually reach their goal .
could you provide us with more information about what the Commission would do in the event that abuse is observed ?
I want to inform the Members that the system is changing so that instead of lighting the warning signal to the President , it will be lit for each of you when you are speaking .
the more we are united and effective at home , the more our case will win through internationally .
as Europe is very dependent on imports , the Member States are united in feeling the need to use intelligently and sustainably the raw materials and commodities required to generate energy or for use in industry or food production .
there are many people who risk their lives or their health to cross the new southern and eastern borders of the EU in particular .
we should not have any fears in this respect .
the European Court of Justice &apos;s rulings ordering the revision of aviation agreements between the European Union and third countries posed completely new challenges for us , particularly in the case of countries like Russia and the USA , notably the latter .
one of the concerns in the energy sector is precisely the fact that we still have very different regulations .
it was stated by my colleague , Mrs Trüpel , a few minutes ago that there is a so-called informal rule that the Committee on Budget &apos;s amendment is to be voted on first .
I would , however , like to come back to some points I think worth emphasising to make the report as effective as possible .
we must draw on principles such as non-violence , democracy , tolerance , solidarity , dialogue , respect and justice as a whole , without choosing , as often happens , however , easier or more convenient struggles with regard to upholding peoples ’ right to self-determination .
finally , I should like to underline the importance of collating information and developing indicators and references , and of entering these in a database which can be consulted interactively .
at the moment , Mr President , I am in a difficult situation . I maintain that I acted dutifully , whereas these elements in the media say that I did not perform my duty .
thanks are due to the rapporteur for the work he has done , but also for the unsparing conclusion he draws .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , three years after the Treaty of Amsterdam was adopted and the famous and much-debated Article 13 was introduced , the Council is proposing two directives to implement the principles of this Treaty .
furthermore , some Member States are particularly unwilling to undertake the mutual exchange of information concerning fraud . Therefore it is important for Member States to have a direct obligation to report cases of VAT fraud , for example , to the Commission .
despite that we must admit that these social clauses are often ineffective and that is why the proposal from a number of NGOs to introduce fair trade labels is really very interesting .
the ethnic conflict is all about the expulsion from Guadalcanal of 40 000 Malaitans back to their own island , to severe hardship , without any compensation .
the destructive mechanism of such competition could be restricted by licensing the right to issue recommendatory health symbols , and creating a uniform system of recognising healthy products .
if the European Union were able to point to just one specific success in the fight against terrorism , the series of imputations against the United States might yet be acceptable , but it cannot .
- ( DE ) In 1993 the Federal Republic of Germany watered down the right to political asylum in its constitution , thus sealing its borders against immigration by asylum-seekers .
the essential purpose of design protection is to foster competition of forms through design innovation .
the Commission proposes that a number of provisions of a technical nature be transferred from the Council to the Commission .
as the report points out , between 1975 and 2000 , the world has gone through some 120 monetary crises , which the IMF defines as depreciation of a currency by more than 25 % in the course of a year .
they will look to the road owner - in general the Government - to increase safety and to reduce environmental pollution .
congratulations everyone - especially since you are making your explanations of vote in writing .
this was indeed a difficult constraint .
- Report : Bart Staes
the European Union should seek genuine cooperation with Russia , which would , not least , involve the European Investment Bank being allowed more opportunities for activity in Russia , an idea put forward by , among others , Mr Schüssel , the Austrian Chancellor , who propounded it in a letter to President Prodi of the Commission .
we must not lose sight of our aims because that would weaken our credibility and our position , which has been challenged in recent years .
this is a good example of a case where national legislation is not enough to ensure that we are rid of crime , but where action at Union level is needed .
author . - Mr President , with your permission , I would propose that we delay a moment or two because this is an oral question to the Commission and we were hoping that Mr McCreevy would be here , but I see that Mr Samecki is going to speak .
however , I think that in the end we are doing so at an appropriate moment , because now that the European Parliament is debating in citizens &apos; rights general , it is confronted with a new treaty on the operation of the EU and with a Charter of Fundamental Rights containing an article specific about the right of citizens to make complaints to the European Citizens &apos; Advocate .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should first of all like to thank Mrs De Esteban Martín for all her hard work over the last few months .
Mr President , the questions are very important in the context of the current debate on GMOs in Europe .
however , in view of the Council &apos;s views on this matter and in order to avoid conciliation , we support the compromise proposal put forward by Parliament for a split comitology procedure whereby decisions on strategic guidelines for the actions to be financed would be subject to a management procedure while project approval for the limited number of projects over EUR 2 million would be subject to an advisory procedure .
it is much better , in my view , to focus on a different paragraph in our resolution : the need for an international force in Palestine .
on the one hand , it is true that there will be inevitable environmental and health consequences if this equipment is not dealt with properly .
some successes have been achieved , especially in relation to the agreement with Switzerland ; in other areas , however , we have been less successful .
the advantages of the Internet largely outweigh its disadvantages .
. Mr President , I too would like to thank the rapporteur for the report and emphasise how important it is that relations between the European Union and India be strengthened and cooperation stepped up .
we have , however , proposed some improvements to increase the programme &apos;s impact .
the guiding principle must still be the vision of EU membership , for which this House – my group included – has so often voted unanimously .
it was only at the end of May and beginning of June that the nutritional surveys carried out in certain areas of the country revealed the crisis underway .
each Member State should instead set up , for example , a solidarity fund designed to help countries hit by various natural disasters .
it is a good example of how the Commission is avoiding inconsistencies in the implementation process by clearly identifying a problem and offering a practical solution .
therefore Chernobyl &apos;s problems are our problems , too .
a number of international organisations just report on violations of human rights during the recent events in Estonia .
it has been estimated that these numbers could triple if the open skies agreement is ratified , and generate an extra EUR 1 billion for the Irish economy .
I therefore greatly welcome the initiative of the Committee on Fisheries to subject aquaculture in the European Union to a thorough investigation in an own-initiative report .
90 % of the chicken meat in the Netherlands contains resistant ESBL bacteria , and last month , it even came to light that resistant bacteria had been found in vegetables after being passed on via manure and the soil .
we wish to express once more our condolences to the numerous victims , and we hope that Europe is able to help bring relief as soon as possible .
( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , I believe that thanks to our rapporteur , Mr Casa , we have a balanced report for welcoming the political decision we are going to take : Slovakia &apos;s entry into the euro area .
 
the demands of the European Parliament need not be any more reticent than the ideas of the Commission .
Farassino report
it is very important that the new Members are not forced to reduce the standard of their legislation by adopting regulations which are too weak .
this is a very pertinent question .
we also reject this report on these grounds .
the Member States pointed out that animals are sentient beings that must be treated well .
gene exchanges between varieties or species have very often led to profound changes in the morphology of the original wild plant .
further efforts must be made in this regard by the Turkish Government .
it is regrettable that Parliament &apos;s timetable prevents us from being out and about among the people on the occasion of this popular event .
to conclude , Mr President , I would like to say that a strategy of this kind would mean that , once the new treaty comes into force , we will not constantly be having to amend proposals that have just been adopted , and it will guarantee full jurisdictional control for the Court of Justice and the full and complete involvement of Parliament in defining policies that go to the very core of citizens &apos; rights .
that is our role and this is the point of my question .
the assessment was made in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , but also in the Committee on Citizens &apos; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs .
Conservatives in the UK have voted in favour .
we repeatedly emphasised that the core of the process had to be based on the principle of partnership , a partnership committed to agreement and to the resolution of problems imposed by the legacy of a long , bitter and bloody conflict ; a partnership that understood the legitimate concerns of the other and that could lay the foundations for a new and different future for both Palestinians and Israelis .
what might this involve ?
I would draw the attention of British Airways , particularly the Chief Executive , and of other airlines , to paragraph 16 of this report , which states that : &apos; social , occupational health and training aspects are essential for the maintenance of a high level of safety in air transport &apos; ; not threats , intimidation of staff and bullying , which seems to be the new management approach of British Airways .
democracy and human rights are also implemented by means of other instruments , and the EIDHR will act as an addition to this whole in special areas .
it is for these that we are aiming with our Amendments 26 , 27 and 32 , along with Amendments 29 and 30 on on-call services , and these I ask you to support .
in fact , the ECB has rejected any strategy likely to favour a euro-dollar parity more favourable to exports and industry , in particular with a view to preventing too significant a fall in the dollar .
this will enable checks to be effective and road safety to be improved without excessive cost .
so far the increase in confidence has not been dramatic but a full return of confidence will naturally take time .
can you not guarantee increasing the police presence to 5 000 officers and training local officers , who would naturally find it easier to clear up crimes than would officers from abroad ?
in the agricultural area the reformed clearance of accounts system and the Integrated Administrative and Control System have contributed to improved management of large amounts of European Union funds .
 
that requires a process of national reconciliation based on a credible plan for the transition to civilian rule and the release of all political prisoners .
the new Labour Government in the United Kingdom welcomes the marvellous opportunity that this six months offers , and I am personally looking forward to the prospect of working closely with my colleagues across Europe to ensure that European industry is sufficiently competitive to meet the challenges we all face today .
therefore , I do not believe that we should read too much into these movements from an ideological or religious point of view at present .
all of the European institutions , and in particular the Presidency of Parliament , will do everything they can to help resolve this unfortunate issue .
Mr President , where there are no rights there are no laws – merely the exercise of force and arbitrary acts .
in fact , the discussion on the EU ’ s course and policy will be a permanent fixture .
it is bad enough to see the Council trying to take unilateral action on an adjustment of the financial perspective from 2004 to 2006 , but to see the inclusion of a guaranteed ceiling on agricultural expenditure up to the year 2013 is totally unacceptable .
Mr President , thank you for inviting the Commission to report to this House on the New Delhi Conference on Climate Change held in October 2002 .
you mentioned the Commission but the reply which you gave was more concerned with seas .
Prime Minister Horn will not sign the agreement with Slovakia , it was announced this week .
for this reason we in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development cannot comprehend why the regulation approved by the Commission and Parliament on the placing on the market of plant varieties has still not been adopted by the Council , why the Commission &apos;s support for cooperation between the Member States &apos; own programmes , the gene banks and the informal sector has only been half-hearted , cumbersome and ineffective , and why even DG VI is toying with the idea of allowing the only integrated programme for the conservation , characterisation , collection and use of genetic diversity in agriculture to expire in 1999 .
finally , it plans to bring third countries up to par in terms of respect for human rights and , in this regard , in many countries the situation is showing no signs of improvement .
there are Member States – and I am from one of them – that manage over and over again to plug the gaps as required .
if these guidelines were followed , they would exacerbate safety problems and would lead to greater social problems , in addition to raising questions about the sovereignty of each state over its air space .
Mr President , I am sorry for interrupting at this point , but before the Commission and the Council reply to this morning &apos;s debate , I want to draw attention to the fact that not a single speaker referred to the non-sectarian nature of the European Union and how important it is that the declaration make clear that the European Union respects all religions , that it is a secular organisation , and that it must maintain its democratic and secular nature if it is to maintain its cohesion .
undoubtedly the Union is the most important economic partner in the region . But as regards European diplomatic intervention in the peace process , both Israel and the United States have made it known that there is no need for this .
( HU ) Madam President , Mrs Lulling asked us to support the motion for a resolution .
I only hope that we will not live to regret the decision we have taken with respect to Kosovo .
I would point out that , in accordance with Rule 103 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure , I have received six motions for resolutions tabled by the six main groups of this Parliament at the end of this debate .
the additional expenditure for rural development measures is discretionary in terms of amount and use and is no substitute for the loss of purchasing power resulting from the price reductions .
the second issue , mentioned briefly by Mrs Gebhardt , concerns cover provided for citizens who take up temporary positions in other EU-Member States , such as students moving to a university wishing to take a car with them ; workers on secondment or members of families moving to another country for a temporary period .
the vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon .
with these criteria fulfilled and observed , nuclear energy could put an end or severely limit the politics of energy dependence .
Mr President , I have put the question as to whether this is a priority to a student from Peru .
something needs to change here .
Mr President , may I thank the honourable Member for making that point .
there are energy levels that we need to return to - that is what the climate and energy package says .
( HU ) I wish to congratulate Alexandra Dobolyi and her fellow authors .
the Services Directive covers such sectors as the construction industry , business services , fitting and installation , trade and distribution , and travel and leisure services .
I do not intend to give a complete outline of the draft budget .
the European Union is a complex body , made up of distinct , individual countries which have been united institutionally .
yet advertising comes about not only as a result of professional offensives but also of occurrences in the region from which the foodstuffs originate .
the Slovenian Presidency will be endeavouring to achieve political agreement on these three proposed regulations in the TTE meeting on 13 June 2008 .
we have now reached that stage and trust that Council will be wholly supportive of our proposals .
there are many false claims being put forward that multinationals will not advance this competitive market of drugs unless they get this particular protection .
I shall return to the subject of Kosovo later .
so I look forward to the votes of this extremely responsible Parliament .
a state is sovereign when it has full powers of authority .
but , above all , apart from these uncertainties , the European economy , having corrected its macroeconomic imbalances , continues to suffer from a fundamental imbalance : the difference between people who are looking for work and people who are working , the imbalance of unemployment .
the directive is about ensuring that we as Europeans benefit economically and culturally from this expanding industry .
we are therefore in this for the long run and will have to remain in Iraq for a long time in order to restore stability to that country .
we hoped that the new Council would become an institution that would help reform the UN and that it would make a determined effort to ensure greater respect for human rights the world over .
the European Union , a fellowship of States , will be responsible for providing the means of participation , but let us not confuse points of view or possibilities , and let us not institutionally change something that has provided Europe with guarantees of security , prosperity , freedom and economic success .
but the ENVI report provides for costly labelling , additional sustainability requirements , extends the definition of legality out of reach and places the burden of due diligence on all operators within the internal market .
I repeat : we no longer have two readings .
the countries of the Black Sea Basin have much to offer us , starting from sources of energy and natural riches .
he has no intention whatever of negotiating with anyone about a ceasefire .
the requirement that the people affected must have been subsidised for a period of at least nine consecutive months as a result of inactivity in order to benefit now from this specific measure is removed .
this is therefore a problem that we are already experiencing in the very heart of Europe .
action is what is called for right now .
Mr President , the main objective of the proposed directive is to achieve a good marine environmental status .
third , the agreement should promote sustainability .
we said so at the time .
I have received six motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 110 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
however , I have the impression that this is just an umbrella concept to disguise your lack of action .
resumption of the session
a botched-up tachograph will certainly do nothing to increase measurement accuracy.4.Competition is being made very easy for the countries of central and eastern Europe .
Madam President , this is a point of order on the agenda .
it is a dialogue between the masterminds of monetary policy , i.e. the European Central Bank , the political powers of Europe , represented by the Council and the Presidency , and the social partners , representing workers and manufacturers .
against the background of an unmistakable radicalisation of the political climate in Vojvodina , I would underline Paragraph 5 of the draft resolution .
after all , this is nothing more than what they used to enjoy in the days of the former Yugoslavia .
failing that , they want those in charge to at least have the decency to tell them directly that they will have to change their way of life and look for other work , because it is obvious that they cannot survive in the conditions that lie ahead and will have to abandon their livelihoods .
apart from the defence of citizens &apos; rights , I should like also to highlight the need for us to protect cultural treasures ...
more than ever before , the European Union needs to explain its aims and policies clearly and comprehensively .
at the Ecofin Council of 10 July 2001 , the Belgian Presidency put forward the idea of financing the European Union directly .
I would like to make a brief remark regarding the principles that guide our efforts .
I would ask Mrs Berger to convey our congratulations to Mrs Gebhardt on her excellent work and our agreement , already expressed by Mr Hernández Mollar , with the idea that this network must cover all fields of judicial cooperation in the European Union , in other words , matters of both criminal and civil law .
consequently , Amendments Nos 71 , 72 , 73 , 101 , 102 , 103 and 107 are not accepted .
the financial agreement concluded in Berlin is today an important success that could not be repeated under the present circumstances . For this reason , some of us fully support it despite the fact that , although it is a good agreement , it does not fully satisfy everyone .
according to the French daily Libération , Mr Borrell was one of five European leaders who dared to voice criticism of Russia .
we already have a Floods Directive , in connection with which it was clear that we could actually achieve a great deal with our existing resources if we took the right measures - such as mapping , risk assessment and , as a third measure , the creation of preventative action plans .
progress has been made within the IMO towards an international agreement on the subject .
these examples show that there is a huge loophole in European law which allows health professionals recognised as unfit to practise in one of our countries the opportunity to work and to put patients at risk in another .
Mr President , I know that it is late and we are tired , but I think this is one of the success stories of the good and close cooperation between the three institutions .
in order to obtain the vote of the poorer countries and the new Scandinavian partners : that is rigour for you .
this definition shows us how important it is to vote in favour of this report , as I shall be doing . The implementation of the GALILEO project will enable us to have world coverage which can be used not only for controlling air , sea and road traffic but also for supporting search and rescue operations .
that means , energy must be saved and energy sources must be promoted which produce less CO2 .
details of the voting list should be known at least a week before voting takes place so that we can all consult our electorates and be aware of what we are voting on .
the word Macedonia is a geographical term .
Member States are the key partners in implementing the Lisbon Strategy and their commitment to effective inclusion policies is a key factor for success .
I propose to take steps when further Commission proposals are made in this regard .
shopkeepers should also be praised .
whether total or partial , privatisation will only make an already dismal situation worse .
we also think that the tests should be carried out on other facilities , such as research reactors , and in respect of other threats , such as the fallout from a terrorist attack or a plant &apos;s structural weaknesses .
in particular , the stance taken by Turkey in relation to the Cyprus issue proves that nothing has changed , despite the distorted view propagated by the international press during the disastrous earthquakes .
Mr President , the Council fully respects the primary role played by the European Parliament in drawing up the Statute for its Members .
this prospect of stability , Commissioner , which the Commission proposed at that time , remains essential for an economic activity which , like any other , needs to make plans , make investments , pay and prepare for what the future may bring , with a previously established regulatory framework .
these activities are therefore totally unacceptable and must be stopped immediately .
- in the hope that the authorities will use the data only in accordance with our stipulations ,
by the same token , the Charter does not in any way limit the competences of the Member States .
I would thank Commissioner Borg for his undertaking to pursue just such a strategy .
we are talking about 15 years after the settlement which gave US $ 500 million to the Indian Government to disburse for compensation and rectification of that landscape .
that omission has now been put right .
Mr President , I have been the co-author of two resolutions in quick succession with Jas Gawronski and Jacques Santer , who are experts on this very isolated country .
this will make sure that the workers on board vessels from third countries having recourse to our ports are covered by the same broad arrangements as the agreement between the two sides of industry .
but we also know that the rewards make the effort worthwhile .
( LT ) Here in the European Parliament , we often discuss human rights .
I am not sure whether our great gamble in this has paid off ; I am already hearing the same old weeping and wailing about what a bureaucratic monster Europe is , and I know that we may well , where the future benefits of this legislation are concerned , be obliged to say nothing or far too little on the subject .
we must manage to ensure that a critical mass of minority-group refugees return , so that this becomes an irreversible process .
the end of the transitional arrangements will force employers to provide their employees with decent living conditions in accordance with social legislation in the host country .
with regard to university-based research , it should be noted that the forthcoming Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development substantially widens the opportunities for enhanced university research activities .
we want you to do so , and we understand that in that way we can support you so that you , who have just joined this Commission , can really control your house . &apos; Take the bull by the horns &apos; - as we say in Spain - and we will be able to achieve a discharge for this year on the part of the majority of the Groups in this House before the summer .
therefore , since we are required to shoulder these new responsibilities , this Parliament must do just that , by proving that it is capable of compromising with the Council of Ministers .
that was a point worth emphasizing , and it is a pity there are not more of us here to hear a tribute which was as unusual as it was well deserved .
small and medium-sized businesses will also benefit from liberalisation through new market opportunities , which ought to boost employment in the EU and provide substitutes for a number of imports .
this needs to stop .
this will represent a further significant step towards full membership of the European Union .
. Mr President , the report by Mr Dombrovskis under discussion on guidelines for the 2006 budget , which concern Sections other than the Commission , creates a basis for the forthcoming budget for these institutions .
many people have spoken about the issue of qualified majority voting , but I would remind you that this was not the only matter discussed .
we need to recognise the sovereignty of states in the choices they make in relation to development and their social , cultural and fiscal policies .
the directive must specify the conditions of entry into the EU and any concrete rights , but it must not create a barrier to a situation where all legal migrant workers can enjoy fair and equal treatment , but , on the contrary , should secure and guarantee such treatment .
in order to address this enormous expectation we need more effective , more transparent and more democratic institutions .
reinforcement of the European Territorial Cooperation Objective ;
my main criticism of the report before us , Mr Huhne , is that you as rapporteur have addressed only , or chiefly , big investors .
I voted in favour of this report , which was approved in this House on the day when we celebrate the centenary of the day dedicated to women .
he is doing one of the most difficult jobs in the world just now , which was not made any easier by yesterday &apos;s events .
they take place when the sea is rough , with winds of more than 100 kilometres per hour , in situations where ships have problems with manoeuvrability , with waves of 8 or 10 metres as in the case of the Prestige or the Erika .
it should also be noted that automatic train protection systems are just one element contributing to the safety of the network .
in its May 2001 communication on the EU ’ s role in promoting human rights and democratisation in third countries , the Commission reaffirmed the priority it gives to the funding of projects seeking to abolish capital punishment .
a constituent &apos;s son went to Greece and suffered an injury there .
European leaders were agreed that it is necessary to strengthen economic policy in Europe by defining future common guidelines and developing an early-warning system for Member States facing economic difficulties .
we also need to strengthen our rules and regulations .
I want to know from the Council as you give us that message why do you or at least some Member States go through the back door and use annexes , attached for other reasons on sensitive issues , to the June 1999 decision and make up new comitology rules for yourselves to jump from qualified majority de facto to simply majority as leverage on the European Commission .
Mr President , Madam Chancellor , honourable Members , I have high hopes for the period between now and the end of this parliamentary term .
what is the difference ?
in my opinion , Commissioner , there should be no Romany camps in Italy , or for that matter in Romania or in any other country of the European Union .
the addition of this element , through our amendment on the consolidation of democracy , is consistent with the more general emphasis on human rights in the regulation which the European Parliament rightly wishes to have clarified .
( DE ) Mr President , it baffles me how the Council can simply leave without batting an eyelid .
once this regulation is adopted by the Council , the Commission will then decide detailed implementing rules which will gradually increase the degree of protection for cattle being transported .
we provide equipment to the Georgian and Ossetian police forces as part of a programme which consists of the voluntary handover and subsequent destruction of small arms in the region .
it is vital to maintain a very clear distinction between information and advertising and to place a strict ban on the latter .
there is one laudable exception , and that is the Kurdish sector . This is something worth highlighting .
I do not believe that anyone supports the introduction of a European system in the EU knowing all the drawbacks and disproportionate consequences it would bring .
given the dramatic situation of expulsions in Azerbaijan and the absence of a proper rule of law , both in terms of fair jurisdiction and civil rights , the linking of the so-called repatriation clause to the cooperation agreement is both unreasonable and incompatible with the UN convention on refugees .
if the politicised rail system ran the railways better , these things would not happen .
it is right and only fair that this should be the case , as salaried workers also make social security contributions .
in certain countries there are notes which have a value of less than five euro . In other countries there are also coins in circulation worth substantially more than two euro .
certainly , it is good that schools are recognised as having a fundamental role in combating unemployment , but there is no reference to the need for schools to operate in the field of planning within Europe as a whole , encompassing the participation of social partners , local organisations and the business world .
I have outlined the sufficient guarantees offered by the and the Accession Treaty .
I should like to thank Mr Crowley for his firm commitment to this matter and thank him for his good advice and suggestions .
Madam President , I am rather surprised to find myself agreeing with a colleague from the other side of the House so wholeheartedly .
we must likewise question the methods of countries outside the EU and impose stricter import controls like those carried out in Australia and New Zealand .
these measures will be intrinsically linked to all of the other proposed long-term measures , in preparation for a common migration policy .
we should not proceed with such a specific programme .
the problem is clearly not the individuals detained in the camps , but rather the fact that human rights are not being respected , despite the fact that all Member States , at least in theory , meet the Copenhagen criteria .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , with regard to the coherence of the actions to be taken , the Fifteen support a strengthening of this coherence at all levels , particularly between the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund , with a more specific focus being given to interventions .
the second-generation agencies were put in place by the Commission with statutes which did not contain the financial safeguards which exist for the two first-generation ones .
as Minister Ask explained very well just now , we need to make the judges in our Member States share a common European judicial culture .
I also sincerely hope that Belgrade realises that its current approach of constructively working with the European Union is far and away more effective than trying to re-write history all the time .
Mr Alavanos also requests the floor for a procedural motion .
I hope everyone will support this resolution .
I should also like to promote once again the family project to be carried out by the foundation in Dublin , which we would like to support to the tune of EUR 400 000 , but which the Committee on Budgets has entirely rejected .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , there are only two observations I wish to make , and they overlap with each other .
the decisions were taken in a completely different place and against a completely different background .
the Kyoto Protocol has been drafted for climate , but ratification and implementation are still a major point of concern .
there is a need for a much more radical change to worldwide funding structures .
I should like to thank all my fellow MEPs in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development who have helped find a consensus with a view to presenting , today in plenary , a resolution in response to the oral question to the Commission and in response to the debate that took place on 25 September in Strasbourg on the difficulties encountered by European beekeeping .
its per capita income is comparable to Spain .
 
in addition , the prejudice against and degradation of these people has gone on long enough .
and the reality is that the transitional period following the accession of Spain and Portugal has come to an end .
it is very important for all of us that we make a programme like that succeed .
it is a very ambitious policy which entails a substantive upgrading of our relationship with partners through deeper political cooperation and a significant degree of economic integration , bringing partners closer to the internal market .
what I am asking you is how we can take a new direction .
the UK requires a final five-year extension to address these issues .
the debate is closed .
because - and here I have three questions to those present - is there any such thing as &apos; fair &apos; competition between prosperous and less-developed coastal regions , or between large and small ports ?
Europe is up and running .
they are complex , and therefore need rules which vary slightly .
author . - Mr President , this is the first time that I have participated in a Thursday afternoon debate , so there are some lessons I think I can pick up for the Conference of Presidents with regard to making the plenary session more attractive .
we need to look at the overall structure and examine whether it is sound .
I do not know whether this applies to Mr Schnellhardt , and I hope that his report , duly amended , will at last be adopted by this House .
as Mrs Graenitz also mentioned , environmental agreements are an important element in the Fifth Environmental Action Programme and are one of the policy instruments that can be used .
given that the additional tariff quota is not consolidated , its quantity should be capable of being adapted to Community demand , not only in the event of an increase , but also in the event of a decrease .
Mr President , I will concentrate on three points .
I am referring to the fact that roughly 15 % of the EU &apos;s current energy supply comes from nuclear energy .
the question is how to facilitate the application of the laws so that the new agents can work in an orderly fashion to produce codes of practice , which is something that was mentioned in all the contributions .
the Oxfam orange juice sold here in Parliament , for example , comes from Cuba .
Madam President , I would like to congratulate Mr Chichester for two reasons .
the EU distances itself from the increasing amount of violence in Gaza and on the West Bank : Israeli encroachment and tank fire in Palestinian-controlled areas , firing on various roads , the killing of certain selected people .
every application for asylum must be dealt with separately , regardless of whether the asylum seeker has previously sought asylum in another EU country .
that is what is behind Amendment 21 and why I emphasise to the Commission that the tragedy of injury is so much more than the economic burden .
on the same trip , we visited Fair Trade cocoa farmers in central Ghana .
as for the &apos; fair value &apos; principle , it favours a short-term approach and makes financial results the dominant factor in company management .
however , I feel insufficient emphasis has been given to the suggestion that this is not simply a phenomenon that can be dealt with by the machinery of criminal justice .
it will do anything in its power in order to promote support for lasting peace in the country .
the issues raised are highly complex , but we can boil them down to this : Europe needs an energy policy that gives us sustainable , affordable and secure resources of energy .
but it is not the case any more that one side is listening and the other one is making its point .
these are the real problems and I wish you success for the Presidency .
the Union has equipped itself with a new instrument for the supervision of the financial sector , which should hopefully prevent the re-emergence of crises like the one we are still struggling to extricate ourselves from .
subject : Investigation of irregularities at Europol On Tuesday 12 June the Council announced that the operation of Europol was being investigated .
however , this does not solve the basic problem of the creation and guarantee of jobs with rights for workers and the assurance of socio-economic development in these regions .
despite certain isolated differences , the economic relationship has continued to develop . The United States and the European Union share great responsibility for international economic and monetary stability .
Russian society is , more than ever , hostage to a propagandist press and is retreating into dangerous nationalism .
I look forward to , and am confident that I will see , some progress soon on all these issues in relation to the Services Directive , which I am so pleased he supports .
on the contrary , most of us have a segmented education .
( SL ) The answer to the first part of Mr Aylward &apos;s question is certainly yes .
so indeed is the spiral of violence .
in a number of cases - not just this one but also the nitrofen case - the system worked very effectively .
recent experience has highlighted , as well as reminding those who had forgotten , that remoteness and a lack of transparency lead to irresponsible behaviour and fraud .
the Lisbon Strategy is the best instrument at our disposal for modernising the European economy , for boosting employment , for creating more jobs and for delivering social cohesion .
I am grateful to Mr Collins for understanding that the Council cannot say a great deal about structural policy after 1999 .
that goes for the developed countries and the developing countries - a 60-80 % reduction by the developed countries and a 30 % reduction by the developing countries by 2020 .
the rules both of the WTO and also the Cotonou Agreement should be applied , but with flexibility , and without their objectives being turned on their heads .
the EU action plan to assist this progress is very ambitious , supporting not only Russia &apos;s democratic and economic reforms but also regional cooperation in matters of nuclear security , environmental problems , humanitarian aid and measures aimed at a future European security system .
the next item is the debate on the report ( A5-0386 / 2002 ) by Mrs Langenhagen , on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control , on Special Report No 2 / 2002 of the Court of Auditors on the Socrates and Youth for Europe Community action programmes ( RCC0002 / 2002 - C5-0257 / 2002 - 2002 / 2125 ( COS ) ) .
it is in fact common ground that a problem exists , but there are times when the solutions proposed seem frankly to me to be impracticable or counter-productive .
however , we know from our experience of World Bank and International Monetary Fund programmes - and what we are currently seeing in Ireland is not so very different from this - that in the end , these countries have no choice .
I should like to say to Chancellor Merkel that codecision is now needed in all areas of policy-making if the checks and balances of democracy are to work at European level .
( SV ) I have an oral amendment to the second clause of paragraph 24 .
a uniform road tax would also mean a more efficient common market and more efficient competition .
we know , however , that , if we are to have a really effective instrument , making use of the full range of elements , including those that perhaps do not come within the Community &apos;s field of competence , a broader approach is needed .
this proposal is for EUR 2 326 459 to assist 598 workers , from 8 enterprises in the printing and reproduction media , who are losing their jobs because of the economic crisis .
Napolitano report ( A5-0023 / 2002 )
he served his full sentence , namely three years in prison .
– Voting time is over .
( EL ) Mr President , I should like to thank the Commissioner for her reply , which fully satisfied me .
Mr President , as we know , the environment is &apos; out &apos; .
I am glad to see that the European Parliament and the Commission share views on the need to rethink the current VAT system .
Mr President , although the laboratory directive was not adopted until 1990 and has not yet been transposed in many Member States , the Commission has already made a proposal providing for massive deregulation and a drop in environmental and safety standards .
if we demand that they get an additional vehicle for the travel office just for the week of the part-session - which is now only four days long - then it would seem to me that we have overstepped the mark and are guilty of harassment .
this consistent directive is an important step towards doing this .
the strategic guidelines must be clear and easy to read and understand .
what we are doing in this respect is continuing to send a delegation from the S &amp; D Group to talks in Moscow next week , where this particular issue will be raised .
if , however , talks were started all over again and some party began to question those innovations , starting with the appointment of a European foreign affairs minister and a European department for external action , you can be sure that somebody else would demand instead that the 2004 Treaty be supplemented or expanded with bolder and more consistent new measures to push the integration process along .
the Black Sea is a border of the European Union , a geostrategic crossroad and a transit region , an area of cooperation trade , fishing , tourism , shipping , a strategic area in the European energy policy .
I therefore regret the fact , Commissioner , that there is a certain amount of nervousness when it comes to issues associated with strengthening the European Union &apos;s anti-dumping arsenal and to applying the general principle of reciprocity in trade with third countries .
it underscores them and emphasises the role of the European Union .
I would like to state as a regional representative that our cooperation is exemplary .
( PL ) In times of crisis , when the integrity of the European Union is under threat , we should , in supporting economic growth , pay particular attention to the cohesion of the Union .
as for the cost : we are in an economic crisis , or rather , we are exiting it , but this is not a justification for fervently not wanting to pay for maternity leave the amount that would be appropriate in the 21st century .
I also believe that both the governments and the parliaments of Poland and the UK will come to understand this fact , and that in the near future they will enable their citizens to join in this historic moment .
it is short-circuiting the democratic scrutiny process and I think it is important that we do credit to this House .
my starting point is : allow the market to go its own way , start up and drive itself onwards , and the sector should then be able to look after itself .
research is the key to implementing the Lisbon objectives .
nevertheless , while we support the principles behind this model , we must insist that it is far from clear .
we also voted consistently against funding propaganda ventures such as the Prince programme .
the Commission would reassure honourable Members that the choice of the site to be made in 2009 will be based on careful examination of the merits of each offer , pursuant to clear procedures and in the best interests of the European Commission and the taxpayers &apos; money .
I therefore call upon the Commission to adopt common legislation governing the whole of the Union as soon as possible .
Mr President , the report of Mrs Podimata is very well balanced and very well explained , and we should all welcome the four financial means introduced by the report tomorrow .
I will be happy to talk about this afterwards .
I accordingly voted in favour of the report and am confident that it will improve patients &apos; rights across Europe .
there are even conflicts , such as the conflict in the Western Sahara , where the European Union is doing precisely nothing .
the second priority is to ensure a balanced strategy encompassing secondary and higher education , vocational training and adult literacy .
this is entirely reasonable , but it seems that we have now forgotten another fundamental right , and that is every people ’ s right to self-determination .
finally , an agreement to return to democracy appears to have been reached between the junta and the Committee of Five of the States of Western Africa .
at this point , I want to focus , in particular , on the bone of contention .
if we are constantly saying that production in China is not up to European standards , that is correct .
there is no doubt that we must learn from the lessons of the past and adapt our agricultural policy to the challenges of the twenty-first century , but it would be unacceptable to allow this reform , in the name of general principles , to sound the death knell for the Union &apos;s most vulnerable farmers .
we should not just be given an excuse and some sort of non-answer .
mercury is extremely toxic .
written statements ( Rule 142 of the Rules of Procedure )
with regard to the arrangements for the accession negotiations with the new Member States , I would also agree with the rapporteur when he stresses , at the beginning of his report , that the negotiations with the associated countries should start at the same time .
it makes a useful contribution to coordinating EU and national policies for project grants .
the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the EC and the Republic of Serbia came into force on 1 February 2010 .
the claim that it is a sui generis case does not indemnify us .
in one decade , what will be the final objective in terms of the competences of the European Union and the Member States with regard to the two issues that Mr Frattini has mentioned : immigration and radical Islamist terrorism ?
throughout this process , therefore , what is guiding us is the development aspect and we clearly intend , in this matter , to make trade considerations dependent on developmental considerations , taking account of the fact that this is our priority with the ACP countries as a whole .
as the European Parliament rapporteur on the evaluation of this Directive , I must say that the concrete application of the right of free movement for our citizens is seriously undermined by Member States which erect dams in breach of the Treaties and of the Directive .
in the future , we shall obviously need a movement to uphold civil rights in electronic commerce .
we have come to agree on important matters .
one of my colleagues afterwards said that point was a powerful intervention .
we know that increased funding would be needed and this is a way of planning to ensure that the huge amounts of money required for the accession will be available .
I may make a mistake on the odd occasion , but in that case I assure you it is absolutely unintentional .
this means that energy conservation , or using less energy , is a target that we are going to fail to meet .
this makes sense neither today , in the face of the crisis , nor in the longer term .
it is essential that we propose rapid accession to the EU to the Georgian authorities , who are only waiting for this .
so if the Council wants to produce not only words but also action , why does the UK Presidency not press for an agreement on road tolls based on the Swiss model ?
( PL ) I would like to thank you very much for allowing me to ask a question .
if we now hesitate and spend weeks disputing among ourselves , we will be throwing away the goodwill that the European Union , especially in the person of Mr Romano Prodi , President of the Commission , has garnered .
this is a crucial measure .
this agency , based in Warsaw , has started work and already has a budget of more than EUR 6 million for 2005 .
Mr President , three weeks ago the European Parliament was highly critical of Belarus &apos; closure of the OSCE office .
stress tests are meant to stress risks .
an ageing population and the specific mobility requirements of the elderly , social migration and climate change are only some of the factors which impose the need to devise a suitable transport policy .
I wish the best of luck to the President of the Commission and to his team , and I trust that under his leadership the Union can progress in respect for diversity .
it would also incur all the transaction costs of selling your shares and then buying them again after the fall .
I believe we all share the same aim : to protect young people and society as a whole as best we can against drugs and drug consumption .
as a result of the reduction in women &apos;s earnings and pensions over the course of their lives , these salary gaps cause poverty among elderly women .
we are talking about figures approaching 1.5 % of Community GDP .
a solution needs to be found here that is fair to both sides .
in February last year , we approved a far-reaching decision in this matter , and it is therefore alarming that the amendment proposed by the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance was rejected by the Committee on Foreign Affairs .
compared with other Member States , I felt dismayed as sometimes it was a third , or even this opportunity was not taken .
I am also quoting animals in zoos .
we want it to be honest with us and to say that it thinks it is a procedure that Council and Parliament have to go through to come to a conclusion about agricultural expenditure and the problems that exist therein .
we saw it in the Copenhagen criteria and we should see it today : that a Member State can be measured by how it protects its minorities , how it protects diversity within its population .
it is clearly evident from both the Commission &apos;s report and Mrs Klaß &apos; report that there are problems in how to use Structural Fund resources to best effect .
ARGO envisages new forms of action such as the definition of better practices , techniques for collating , analysing and disseminating information and actions in third countries .
in the first place , she had the courage of her convictions and argued passionately in favour of them , but always with respect for the other party .
finally , a comment on the economic situation mentioned by Mr Trichet .
on the contrary , the complacent attitude and leniency shown by the Commission could only be taken as incentives to continue along this disastrous route .
( Parliament adopted the text )
– Mr President , The real challenge for the European Union is to provide an opportunity for breaking out of the vicious circle of social exclusion .
so , in order to assess this situation and to decide on the necessary means , we really need a European approach .
derivatives are considered to be one of the basic causes which helped trigger the financial crisis .
we have a deep economic and financial crisis , so we will make our banks take stress tests !
the first is to debate competition issues from the perspective of the internal market as a whole .
obviously biofuels might be one cause but , as Mr Daul said , this represents 2 % of production , 1 % of surface area , so we should stop overstating this .
in the May riots 2 , 000 cans of teargas were fired and , following that , 200 people were moved directly into prisons , including , disgracefully , one five-year-old girl who was kept in isolation for 12 days whilst the prison authorities lied to the parents about her being held .
in the other areas , however , we do not have such controls .
for such substances we must insist on getting the standard scientific data .
I also want to thank Commissioner Busquin for the way in which he began the discussion with new ideas about the European Research Area .
we need to take that forward .
although we are very good at investing in research , we are lagging behind in the utilisation of this research , in bringing innovation to the market and , subsequently , keeping high-quality production in this part of the world .
the Commission is very conscious of the essential role women play in agriculture and in rural areas .
a fellow member of the European People &apos; s Party described his Party as being friends of security , as if there were any enemies of security in this House !
the only exceptions apply to Greece , which was the price paid for Greece &apos;s agreement and thus for achieving the necessary majority in the Council of Ministers against the votes of Germany and Austria , with Denmark and Spain abstaining .
at the same time , it ignores a number of key practical aspects relating to the real social situation in the European Union and the real problems we face .
in my own area for the last thirty years there have been families who have sought the return of the bodies of their loved ones for burial .
 
( Parliament approved the motion )
these include , among other things , the introduction of a financial transaction tax and an obligation to meet minimum social standards .
the Member States must reach agreement on a date for the next European elections which does not coincide with national traditional events or public holidays , in order to optimise the conditions for the turnout in the elections .
we want to see public money not only spent up but spent in a more efficient manner .
on behalf of the UEN Group . - ( PL ) Mr President , a nation &apos;s standard of living is a function of material assets , but its identity is determined by its culture , in the broadest sense of the term .
I very much favour trying to move to more cogeneration , as other Members have mentioned .
to conclude , the Council urged the Commission to introduce these proposals as quickly as possible , as soon as it had all of the necessary information and data , including the European Parliament &apos;s point of view on the report .
women and girls with disabilities are at very great risk of violence , including sexual violence , both within and outside the home .
I should like to give a further reaction to the Swedish Presidency .
there is a danger that the National Assembly will no longer be able to function as a forum for the free exchange of views .
the time has now come to make up for years and years of lost time .
the report contains a number of excellent and well-considered proposals .
I supported the report by my colleague , Mr Guerrero Salom , in order to remind the Member States of their responsibilities to developing countries in the face of the global challenges of the economic crisis and climate change , for which they are not responsible .
there is far more concern within the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy with regard to Romania .
as the EU is the most &apos; open &apos; market in the world , we need to adopt a framework to protect our businesses and the relevant conditions that will bring about a balance with our basic trading partners , so that European undertakings enjoy similar competitive conditions .
this has been established within the framework of the Joint Parliamentary Committee .
first of all , I would like to thank the rapporteurs , Mr Herzog and Mr Lipietz , for their excellent reports .
Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina will not be included in this first decision on visa exemption , but they are not being left in the lurch .
Mr Santini &apos;s report - which I welcome - focuses on mountain areas .
we will need , in future , to monitor the specific effects of these new developments .
the Ombudsman &apos;s office clearly has resolved many problems , but it has not been in a position to resolve them all .
we are in an extremely difficult situation in which everything is falling apart .
I would particularly like to thank Mr Őry for this .
you are still saying things that are entirely false .
I hope that in the Seattle Conference these issues will be dealt with in such a way that the new agreements will , within the framework of the World Trade Organisation , bring about an appropriate legal framework .
perhaps that could be considered .
Mr President , the question at issue here is the political management of globalisation , so that we can encourage the orderly development of trade and avoid market disruption .
Romania is the most typical agricultural country of the candidate countries , having many small farms .
what I can promise you , because I have myself carefully considered all the loan budgets and all the periods in question , is that there will be no problems , whatever the date on which the Council reaches its decision .
I should like to emphasise this .
that vacuum is quickly filled by others and the European Union is then usually approached exclusively in terms of its financial resources , as Mr Spencer has rightly pointed out .
in any event , the issue of the instability of agricultural markets is becoming one of the main challenges facing European Union agriculture and agricultural policy .
there was a clear opinion that more independent disciplinary procedures should be envisaged .
Mr President , at the time of the vote on the original budget for 1996 , my group could only protest against a draft budget that was irresponsible because it was constantly increasing .
in an open discussion about this topic , the Committee on Agriculture pointed to an urgent need to exchange opinions concerning the implementation of common agricultural policy and to speak about the problem without prejudice .
Mr President , I agree with all the speeches that have been made , all of them except for a speech by Mr Obermayr , which , incidentally , I only agree with partially .
to begin with , there is Amendment No 1 , which means altering the legal basis for the Commission proposal from Article 130s ( 1 ) to Article 100a .
it is primarily a human rights report .
in addition , his own-initiative enquiries have also had direct consequences , and resulted in positive administrative reforms .
we should not forget , however , that cultural measures have a mainly indirect effect on employment .
likewise , vessels from other countries also fish in EU waters , notably under the terms of the so-called &apos; northern agreements &apos; .
so much damage has already been done to the ozone layer that the hole is now three times the size of Australia .
joint tourist trails and the development of transport , the environment and contacts between universities will be high-visibility projects and will create an image for the Danube strategy .
such a system could encourage a virtuous circle where prompt payment becomes the norm not the exception .
question No 4 by John Iversen ( H-0488 / 97 ) :
I have consistently maintained the view that a network of ombudsmen and petitions committees is needed to supervise the application of Community law by the Member States .
it will offer the EU the opportunity to act in line with its ambitions , underpinning the Lisbon Treaty &apos;s CFSP provisions - to be not only a payer in conflict situations , but also a player .
they are the cornerstones of pluralistic democracy .
we tend to forget Moldova , even though it is enormously important to our security .
as far as frontier workers , as well as people on secondment , are concerned , I am of the opinion that they should be given a choice .
it is in our interests , but to an even greater extent it would be in the interest of China and its people too .
I am not saying that to put the blame on you alone .
this agreement establishes Albania ’ s obligation to readmit its nationals living illegally in the territory of the Member States and reciprocally places an obligation on the Union to readmit nationals of EU Member States living illegally in Albanian territory .
in this sense , I think the Commission should be grateful to me for pointing out to it that , actually , EUR 18 million multiplied by three equals EUR 54 million , which would appear to be a more appropriate figure .
( DE ) Mr President , Mr De Clerck , Mr De Gucht , Mrs Reding , we have heard enough already about how important transatlantic relations are ; I do not believe that anybody here is questioning that .
since then , we have seen a succession of crises – some small , some large-scale , the result of local or world level restructuring – leading to a catalogue of redundancies .
the knowledge that has been acquired through the research programmes should be analysed and made available , and should also lead to new processes and products .
it is a practice that should be banned .
what we need is an established framework within which to work , coupled with a willingness to shoulder social responsibility .
however , such an agriculture will not be possible unless in future commercial international negotiations , there is recognition of the legitimate rights of regional zones of preference .
it is much more specific than that because the Commission has already committed itself to presenting a proposal for a global programme in this area , and that will happen in the near future .
this impotence feeds the conviction in the United States that they are the avenging angel .
the controls that are currently carried out at European internal borders should be able to end .
finally , I wish to ask for particular attention to be paid at the summit to the most vulnerable emigrants , women and children , especially unaccompanied children .
I can already hear honourable Members sighing that this story has dragged on and on , but it is now on the point of resolution .
 
if we are to criticise anyone , it is in any case not our Commissioner . Rather , it is the men in the Commission to whom we should be addressing our attention .
Václav Havel is gravely ill and has been hospitalised .
it is also vital to alleviate the terrible humanitarian and economic situation that exists in the Gaza Strip , which is governed - in inverted commas - by Hamas , an organisation that is on the EU &apos;s list of terrorist organisations .
we constantly pass resolutions and the Commission constantly produces strategy documents telling us how we are going to get there .
back in 1990 , in this very House , I denounced contamination of feeds .
we have already achieved quite a lot over the last 15 years with the tremendous increase of women in managerial positions .
Europe would be inundated with a flood of supposed scandals and consumer confidence in our high quality food - and it is high quality - would be shaken even further , and needlessly so .
in your work programme for 2000 you state something quite clever .
I would like to make it clear to Parliament that there is one point on which I have no doubts .
many of the recommendations in the report are in line with the current view of the Commission on policy development to combat cybercrime and improve security .
there was fighting between Muslims and Christians in Jos and disturbances in Kano where , moreover , there has been a cholera outbreak .
we need to stay focused on our goals here , to be ambitious for Europe , and also ambitious for the world .
de-mining is also important .
so , to all who took part , including our other colleagues , many thanks .
we must absolutely , therefore , help Mexico .
so : who is lying , the German Federal Government or Euratom ?
stricter rules and better information for the public are extremely important for Portugal , given the extent of the Portuguese coastline , and given the social , cultural and economic value that that coastline and its innumerable waterways bring to the country , in terms not only of tourist activities , but also of socio-cultural activities .
I abstained from voting on Recital X and paragraph 38 , which concern women &apos;s access to abortion .
today &apos; s debate is , of course , first and foremost concerned with conditions in Serbian prisons .
I have three major reasons for that .
at the outset of a potential invasion , however precise the operation is , massive collateral damage will ensue .
at the end of the day , the votes had to be repeated because those who had asked for there to be a check on the quorum were themselves no longer present and did not take part in the vote .
we have a lot of catching up to do in these areas in particular .
it is essential to encourage maximum involvement from all of the actors involved , including small and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) , industry , universities and governments .
it was largely parliamentary in character , it was held in public , it engaged in dialogue with the public and civil society , and it had many months in which to do its work .
I have voted against the report because it pays too little attention to the sometimes very poor working conditions in Latin America and offers too few proposals for improving them .
in our view , unspent amounts should be returned to the Member States , at least after two years .
the outcome of the referenda in France and the Netherlands cannot be ignored without widening the gap between Europe ’ s elite and its citizens .
thirdly , I would like to know whether there will now be a follow-up document that really does tackle all the difficulties that are still unresolved .
I think that it is an excellent idea to actually get together on Monday ; I sincerely hope that the European leaders can then iron out their differences and that they do not embarrass the European population and us again .
I have agreed with this report , which is the result of the conciliation process that was conducted , because I believe it contributes directly to protecting workers from noise at work , a particularly sensitive area .
 
the Austrian rules go far beyond the minimum standards stipulated in this report .
hence the value of this report .
the number of victims of passive smoking is also tragically high - about 80 000 European citizens die every year owing to other people &apos;s bad habit .
Mr President , I should like to pass on the European Commission &apos;s reactions to the different points that have been raised in this urgent debate on human rights .
in all of the EU &apos;s external assistance programmes there needs to be further re-evaluation of the provision of assistance to countries in the region in order to promote development and economic justice and to support the reformers themselves in the reform process .
in reality , therefore , this is an unfair measure .
Commissioner , I call on you to convene an internal affairs council in Malta as soon as possible , before the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs .
it is in this context that this intervention plan for Poland has been designed , a plan which relates to the 189 individuals who have lost their jobs at H. Cegielski-Poznań , a firm which produces maritime diesel motors , and four of its suppliers .
according to World Health Organisation data , across the world , two million people die prematurely from respiratory diseases each year due to the use of this fuel .
we share Parliament &apos;s view that , as part of Russia , Kaliningrad is essentially a Russian responsibility .
what is more , I firmly believe that the development of online trade holds considerable advantages for consumers .
what is more , moving makes Parliament &apos;s work considerably less efficient .
that is why , technically , the payment was made on 28 December .
their assimilation as such would create a regulatory framework that inhibits innovation and provides uninformed users with tools that they do not see as being intended for certain uses , for example , the possibility of making an emergency call from a games console which can establish one-way communication .
if we are to have any sense of responsibility , there is therefore no point in proposing new measures , in particular price increases , when the Agriculture Council has just unanimously reduced these same prices within Agenda 2000 .
this is why I should like to leave at 11 a.m.
.
this will not only allow us to hold a debate on human rights outside the European Union , as is customary in this House , but it will also allow us to hold a yearly debate on fundamental rights and how they are applied by the different governments inside the European Union , as well as to see whether the European institutions are doing their jobs as they should be .
we have not yet discussed in detail his substantive suggestions as to what should be done within the Parliament &apos;s own rules of procedure .
if the report is adopted in its current form , without taking into account a number of proposed amendments , it will for example no longer be possible to record radio and TV broadcasts for short-term use for the inmates of care homes , hospitals , prisons and so on .
this shows the magnitude of the effort that rich countries must make in order to attempt to restore some balance within the world trade system , which more than works in their favour .
almost a year has already passed since the floods .
this has enabled marked progress in many countries , something which benefits the countries as a whole , whilst opening up markets .
Mr President , I am going to talk about Alzheimer &apos;s disease and other forms of dementia .
I would ask you to raise this matter with the College of Quaestors in order to put a stop to this , as this is beneath us all .
very well , Mrs Lindholm .
there still remain a number of professions within the European Union - albeit not many - to which the rights of freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services , as laid down in the Treaty , have not so far been applied .
Mr President , as many of us know , the GSP system is up for review and the current system is coming to an end .
they use cross-subsidy to the tune of 31.8 billion of public money - and rising fast - compared to our EUR 6 billion - and falling .
I thank him for his response with regard to the chemical industry and also to the agreements established in Central America , the Caribbean and Latin America and the forthcoming agreement with Asia .
if there is enough political will in the Council , anything is possible .
alas , Mr Radwan , you see all the symptoms , but you cannot bring yourself to name the genetic disease afflicting the euro and provoking the scepticism of the markets , which have devalued it by 20 % , indifference on the part of the economic players , who have yet to adopt it , the distrust of the citizens : in the last survey , 41 % of Europeans already thought that the euro was a bad thing for them and , admit it , there were signs of panic among the euro supervisory authorities , 18 months before the planned withdrawal of the national currencies .
I wish , though , to appeal to the Commission to keep a careful eye on how China meets the obligations it has entered into by joining the WTO .
the compromise proposal , which is more humane that the US approach , should allay US concerns that patent laws could be breached and weakened .
this is a record to be proud of and I would like to congratulate Mr Diamandouros .
we shall try to take a delegation to Skopje before the summer .
furthermore , I must recall that this subject falls , objectively – see Article 95 ( 2 ) TEC – outside the EU ’ s sphere of action .
the decision to bring about uniform social standards in European road transport is , in general terms , the right one to take , but , when I consider the improvements I initially hoped to see to the conditions of lorry drivers , this result really does bring us down to earth .
European business has suffered from the failure to reach agreement on the European Company Statute and related measures .
how will they impose a peaceful solution in the context of the autonomy sought by the Council ?
I should like to start by commenting on the discharge of the ECB &apos; s accountability vis-à-vis the European Parliament .
let me begin by briefly addressing a few questions in connection with the report on the 1995 Cohesion Fund .
everybody who has studied the sociology of law is well aware that this is not true .
to make things even worse , the EU risks committing the same mistakes in Tunisia &apos;s neighbouring country , Libya .
the same problem exists with regard to China , I believe .
Mr Patten has just recommended what could be called a terrorist charter for Northern Ireland .
yet they wanted us to buy back – to pay in order to buy back – our designations of origin .
the international crisis that is now being felt has helped to exacerbate this state of affairs .
to the governments in the US and Europe , the risk of internal unpopularity weighs more heavily than the risk of new atrocities in the former Yugoslavia .
at the same time , however , we note that previous growth forecasts are now having to be scaled down quite drastically .
through a dozen or so budget lines - and the amounts increase considerably from year to year - the major trade unions will receive more than ECU 50 million .
I was involved myself , as was my colleague , Mr Rübig .
I should like to highlight this sector in particular , because we are still a long way from having the really efficient network of libraries in Europe that is an absolute must .
it therefore cannot be said that nothing is being done in this area .
the ‘ yes ’ I shall say by voting in favour of the Corbett report is the ‘ yes ’ of a militant .
Mr President , I want to begin by warmly welcoming Mr Adamou &apos;s report , which we wholeheartedly support .
I do not doubt that the initiatives announced by the Commissioner will have significant benefits for the Union ’ s future , but we cannot forget the legislation that has already entered into force and that has not been transposed into national legislation by certain Member States with sufficient rigour .
what is worse , it has made the discussion on the Takkula report particularly difficult , because when we talk about involving citizens in the European Union , we actually mean all citizens .
as for the fight against the funding of terrorist groups , if the governments really want to conduct it they should immediately abolish banking secrecy and business secrecy .
the Council just cannot manage to make an assessment and take decisions .
India is just at the beginning of a development path which will make it one of the key economic players of this century .
we all know that it is argued in business circles that we must now take a more cautious approach to Burma , that China wants to grab the Burmese market for itself , and that the European Union ’ s competitiveness is at risk if we do not take a softer line on Burma .
that is what it is really about , ladies and gentlemen .
secondly , we agreed to mobilise the flexibility instrument for programmes in heading 4 : External Actions , for a total of EUR 275 million .
this behaviour means that the Commission breached its obligation to cooperate with the Ombudsman sincerely and in good faith during his inquiry , and was detrimental not only to interinstitutional dialogue , but also to the EU &apos;s public image .
we therefore need to get some more politics into the WTO .
she was a wonderful colleague who opposed conformism and fought for all noble causes , bringing passion to her work and a radiant smile which you all knew .
the best way to combat &apos; social dumping &apos; would have been to impose a minimum wage aligned with that of the country where it is highest .
after all , only a unanimous stance of all those involved , including professional fisheries , recreational fisheries , regional and national authorities , environmental and nature organisations , can bring about a U-turn .
so far , we have only received estimates and now they must gradually be replaced by actual values .
that is the progress that has been made , the improvements on last year &apos;s tests that you quite rightly hoped for and which have been made this year .
just a few months before the summit is to be held , the world &apos;s leading politicians have not even said definitely whether or not they intend to be present at the meeting in Johannesburg .
the price of slaughter pig is following the seasonal downwards trend .
the new agreement should facilitate the creation of low-carbon plans on a national level , supported by legislation .
on the other hand , what is very clear , and what is documented in all kinds of impact studies that have already been done by the way by the Commission , on all kinds of items , is that a lot of our jobs are linked to intellectual property rights and that is one of the reasons we attach such importance to that topic .
the negotiators working on behalf of the European Union have to make this very clear right from the start .
as we see it , this is also the right time to accept the possibility that the Member States might allow the conformity of manufacture in series to be established by an approved body . This body would also be linked in some way to the undertaking body without the Community marking provided for in the directive .
it is both urgent and vitally important that this framework decision on data protection be adopted .
it remains a fight to the finish , and eventually , only democracy and the credibility of a democratic European project are set to suffer .
this is a success story : over the last 14 or 15 years , the outermost regions have benefited from special treatment via these programmes — Poseidon , Poseima and Poseican — which have allowed four million citizens , living on islands spread throughout the world — in the Central Atlantic , in the Caribbean and in the Indian Ocean — to have a decent way of life that is consistent with their needs .
we are convinced that the debate that is going to take place in the European Council and the Commission and , of course , the dialogue with the European Parliament , must bring about a 2020 Strategy that involves serious governance and is demanding in its objectives and focused on the areas that I have just mentioned .
of course , we deal with the transition back to Chinese sovereignty of Hong Kong .
yes , nine trillion .
once we have open borders for citizens , we will also have open borders for criminals , and when we have open borders for criminals , we need open borders for our police as well .
thank you , Mr Monti .
I feel that we must be constructive in learning from this morning &apos; s events .
the Catalan Autonomous Communities , meanwhile , do not have as much .
however , in Amendment 125 in particular , there is a very serious translation error .
on Belarus : the Commission is closely following developments in Belarus .
the G20 was united in favour of the fiscal rescue two years ago , but its unanimity was driven by fear .
it is evidence of the fact that young people are extremely interested in politics .
it is time to stop the EU thinking in terms of central planning and becoming an &apos; EUSSR &apos; .
and , finally , if autumn is the deadline , the end of October is autumn .
I welcome those sorts of initiatives .
however , in the absence of these powers , it should not seek to substitute a less effective measure .
I have had personal contacts with the representatives of the two countries and am confident that the power bridge between Poland and Lithuania will be created .
it must be stipulated in the budgets of the ACP countries that a minimum of 35 % of the funds are to go to social welfare , 20 % of which to education and healthcare .
if profits disappeared , this might lead to companies having to increase their national prices .
in the light of September 11 , the Foster report is a strong contribution to the security of all EU citizens .
so , the Commission has a very long and , I would say , a very respectable , track record on following EU legislation being implemented in Member States .
so what is this about ?
I am more specific on some points .
the ports that already have effective regulations and a safe system are actually being penalised in favour of the much laxer attitude of other ports .
( FR ) Mr President , I think that you are going rather too quickly .
the wish of the British Government in this case is for the 27 governments to control the Parliament , which is the opposite of parliamentary democracy .
the Committee on Budgetary Control has done its homework ; it has unanimously reached a common position in agreement with the German Presidency , and has just this minute approved the accompanying interinstitutional agreement .
the situation , then , is as follows : one of the three languages will be used for legal protection and two other languages for information and communication .
they can be employed locally on a very small and inexpensive scale , which is also , in a very literal sense , empowering people .
the Committee on Fisheries has taken the very commendable initiative of developing a view of EU fisheries after 2002 .
during the current year , the Commission has been engaged in a pilot scheme decided by Parliament at the end of 2003 . This pilot scheme currently serves to finance an exploratory study under the direction of the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research ( Unidir ) and the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute ( SIPRI ) ; it will help the Commission , in cooperation with Parliament and the Council , to press ahead with the programming of new financing instruments .
if not , we fear that we will no longer see the wood for the trees .
on biometrics , on passenger data transfers – that is what we are in danger of getting .
in other areas , things are taking a little longer .
this is the context in which I wish to place this debate .
it will make it harder for non-aligned countries to retain their non-aligned status .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner Verheugen said that some of what we are hearing about the discussions gives us cause for concern .
I also have doubts as to the choice of per capita GDP as an absolute reference .
anyway , you saw what happened because it was reported in the press .
it will not end with the adoption of this report , which still leaves some questions unanswered , and which we will undoubtedly have to come back to in the near future .
( RO ) Given that this year , 2009 , has barely started , I would like to tell you all that , in my view , it is not any ordinary year .
I am , however , also supporting Amendment No 40 , which grants existing medicinal products an additional three years &apos; data exclusivity in the event of a new indication .
the directive on refrigerators , which the next speaker Mr Macartney has reported on , may even now be being debated in the Council .
we cannot lose sight of them either .
that is why people do not want to recognise the difference between heavy traffic through Alpine valleys and the same heavy traffic on the plains of Flanders .
in our report , meanwhile , there is no mention of anything other than China and Russia .
social welfare and healthcare costs will then come down , so allowing us to cut other forms of taxation .
this is a question of policy , so it is logical that the decisions should be taken by politicians , not be technical personnel .
at the conference on company law organised by the German Presidency , Mr Lehne rightly said that the European Commission could be brought before the Court for Justice for failure to fulfil its obligations .
sometimes , however , you have to admit - as with many things in life - when things are not working , and you have to consider alternatives .
that is why , now , contrary to everything on which we had reached agreement , there is no longer any reference in our report to the zero rate for wine .
of course , the compromise reached is by no means ideal and does not meet all of our expectations .
I would also like to say that my colleagues have been remarkably good-natured and entered into the discussion in a spirit of cooperation and good will .
therefore , today &apos;s debate is not only welcomed , but also necessary for ensuring a good future and sustainable development .
thirdly , accelerating globalisation – which is increasingly identified in the public mind with cheap production in China – is an issue and is leading to pressure for protectionism in developed markets , which both the European Union and China need to work to avoid .
risk evaluation of long-term effects has been enshrined , as has the possibility for Member States to set additional requirements for environmentally sensitive areas .
I would simply like to have more data gathered .
I see little sense in the letter proposing a limit of one per cent .
this is why one could , through a somewhat summary analysis , imagine that those funds might be redistributed on the economic circuit by massive injections into the markets of the reserves that have thus become useless .
the less favourable redefinition of coastal areas in Objective 2 from areas depending on fishing and in Objective 1 which would eliminate areas distant from the coast requiring structural funds to support aquaculture and processing has to be resisted and changed , as this is clearly discriminatory .
I believe this cannot be conducive to democracy , and so this is a vitally important area of concern .
instead of relying on States , NEPAD relies on the regional dimension , which is larger and has a larger market , thereby allowing economies of scale to develop .
20 . Appointment of a Member of the Court of Auditors ( David Bostock ) ( vote )
Eastern and Southern European countries , emerging from planned economies and militarisation , were mentioned .
my answer is no – this perspective is clearly not up to the task .
however , the fact is that putting these agreements into practice at EU level has already shown us that such promises of benefits ring hollow for both workers and passengers .
I would like a serious debate to be held on this topic in plenary .
Austria , Finland and Sweden are all countries making above average use of them , and their attention must clearly have been drawn to them during the accession negotiations .
there would be no more unemployment and great prosperity .
duplications with other organisations and bureaucratic inefficiencies must therefore be avoided .
Mrs Malliori &apos;s local approach can achieve a great deal , and the establishment of mobile low threshold help services is a good idea .
as Mr Rasmussen mentioned , it is also very important to see pre-emptive diplomacy .
( applause )
in addition , a physical veterinary check is carried out on a minimum of 20 % of all consignments of imported meat .
it is a well-balanced report which acknowledges the considerable progress made but expresses a number of reservations regarding the self-interested move of members of the civil service , which is evidence of a rather exaggerated interpretation of the spoil system , and the issue of state control of the press and television .
three or four weeks have elapsed from the start of the massacres until this decision .
the Commission is fully aware of the possible cost implications of data retention obligations on the providers of electronic communication services .
we , the European Parliament , cannot and must not accept this ruling .
I took some persuading that a directive such as this was necessary at all .
I thank the Commissioner for his statement .
the group was not making a loss ; on the contrary , it made a profit last year of several hundred million Belgian francs .
I should like to thank the chairman of the committee , Michel Rocard , and all my colleagues .
I am aware that non-medical care is one of the fastest growing areas in terms of job creation .
clearly , bulk data is an issue and it is an issue that cannot be skirted round .
will any more concrete initiatives and decisions be forthcoming ?
Israel is completely indifferent to the EU ’ s statements , for the Israelis know that none of the foreign ministers take their own words seriously .
I discovered this morning that a commemorative envelope has been issued , by the European Parliament , of Mr Georges Marchais , who approved of all the communist crimes , who supported the invasion of Poland , and the invasion of Afghanistan .
2009 progress report on Croatia
 
Mr President , Mr Bösch has prepared a good report on protection against fraud .
we welcome the criticism of the previous two measures in the Virrankoski report and , while we are against the decision to adopt the PDAB 3 unamended , accept that the raft of positive measures outlined must be voted through this session .
Mrs Ferrer , I share your vision for the future of the textiles and clothing sector in Europe .
even before his European presidency begins , his house of cards is collapsing .
the Cairo consensus defines , as a result of a huge international discussion , the balance in the policy .
therefore , if we had a common programme , we could then perhaps implement a more refined strategy that would engage in a more direct way with the specific aspects - and even local aspects - of this problem .
 
there has to be respect for the rule of law .
the aim of the internal market is to give consumers a wide range of high quality goods and services at good prices , while at the same time guaranteeing a good level of consumer protection .
these changes contain two clear priorities : an increase in expenditure , to improve liquidity , and the simplification of the rules to allow projects to be approved more quickly .
written explanations of vote
we need support for the sound and painless restructuring of our agriculture .
I would like to ask the Commissioner if in intelligent systems the subject of information to citizens is taken into account , as it could enormously reduce stress about disinformation .
for Parliament , the Erika III package was always a package and never a collection of cobbled together measures .
in this respect I welcome President Obama &apos;s intention to move towards closure of Guantánamo .
to this end , we shall present a proposal for a legal basis which provides for the possibility of using financial resources to support the application of re-admission agreements , including forced return .
here is a modern , present-day version of the EU &apos;s peace mission .
it was only with great difficulty that diabetes was mentioned in the Sixth Framework Programme .
thank you Mrs Mann , but the discussion of the Minutes ended over an hour ago .
the livelihoods of workers in countries with high wage levels and high social standards , which are costly to maintain , are being threatened by workers from countries with low wages and social standards , especially in the construction sector , which is labour-intensive and depends heavily on the general economic situation .
however , the euro is of itself no guarantee .
before we look at the agenda , I must tell you of some news which is positive for once : a positive piece of news relating to a situation in Spain , but one which I believe is good for the whole of Europe .
public opinion is distrustful of the enlargement process , especially inside the countries of the Union .
the simple truth is that in this field there are questions that cannot go unanswered .
should we fail , it will undoubtedly be a failure for all of us .
Al Qaida sleeper networks still remain in 52 countries .
ladies and gentlemen , I want to repeat once again that the Commission is particularly aware of the importance of petitions as a yardstick for the day-to-day concerns of the citizens of Europe .
this measure , which we are already applying with considerable success in my country , Spain , has the great virtue of discouraging those people who destroy our forest heritage whose sole motivation is then to speculate with the land .
these cross-border partnerships provide services to frontier workers such as relevant information about their rights and obligations .
I take note of what you say but I cannot now reverse that matter .
responses need to be swifter and more efficient . I am well aware that Member States are conscious of the fact that delaying responses can facilitate their political decisions .
I would at this point also like to thank those colleagues who stayed on board in difficult moments .
I would now like to mention two specific points . Firstly , the costs to employers of creating employment are far too high .
– Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the first thing we need is a standardised European procedure for stemming the environmental impact of air transport .
in recent times , we have witnessed appalling disasters in which people searching for a more secure life have met with death beyond the EU &apos;s borders .
the Commission shares your views about the importance of adequate frequency allocation and the need for sufficient flexibility in that respect .
my country , Greece , is one of the EU &apos;s 15 original members .
the 2020 strategy also focuses on innovation .
codecision procedure removes power from the Commission and brings it to Parliament .
this , of course , is where , especially , use of the Internet comes in .
this will be the key to success .
still , even for those such as myself who were not able to follow every twist and turn , my group is certainly extremely pleased with the outcome and looks forward to supporting the rapporteur in the vote tomorrow .
even under the Taliban there was at least a semblance of central control that limited the excesses of these regional autocrats .
we have to ask whether our Euro-Mediterranean policy was all words and no action .
they cannot be got at and it is therefore quite unacceptable that they should continue to behave as if they were members of some religious cell answerable only to the God of the Market .
as the ECB itself points out , poor economic growth is not least the result of the Member States ’ failure to make the structural reforms that are necessary , and cannot therefore be blamed on the ECB , which , contrariwise , points out that the Member States need to shoulder more responsibility in this respect .
thank you for listening and Merry Christmas .
it is not the intention that some Member States should impose standards which the other countries find virtually impossible to meet .
we welcome the establishment of such a forum , but , just as a forum of this sort supplements the deliberations of the Convention rather than supplanting them , so civil society and discussions within it do not replace Parliament , but add something to it .
we should say , when the Commission sends us a proposal – and this again is a recommendation – that with each proposal there should be just a short checklist about the procedures that the Commission has already gone through and the ones that it will go through in future .
of course we can consider the situation in terms of existing needs .
the innovative nature of this programme lies in the fact that it could develop as an interface between culture , social policies and health and that , if Parliament endorses the pilot project , it will be providing the Commission with the opportunity to create a programme which will encourage dialogue between elderly people from 25 different countries .
I wish to emphasise the need for action to prevent psychological violence as well against women .
to this end , the Commission must channel its efforts into helping improve these procedures , thereby discouraging the illicit use of these instruments .
we will see how the planning cell works .
the answer to that question is , ultimately , other consumers .
its aim is to make citizens more aware of the fundamental values , such as democracy , solidarity , cultural diversity and tolerance , upon which our Community is based .
this violence is both physical and mental , both private and public and it costs the lives of 1.5 million people each year .
it is quite clear that Lady Ashton is more gifted at issuing moralising press releases and playing Lady Bountiful than she is cut out for dealing with the diplomatic issues that you want her to tackle on behalf of the 27 Member States .
even though in this area we should have liked the text to have been a little more precise and , to that extent we would have been in favour of adding to the text as it presently stands Mrs Sandbaek &apos;s Amendment No 84 , which would impose a total ban on all manipulations involving not just the human body , but embryos as well .
 
on the contrary , following the terrorist attack on 11 September , the European Union is being called on to fund intergovernmental cooperation in the so-called area of justice , that is , to keep files on and prosecute citizens who go beyond the bounds of resistance and reaction tolerated by the system .
in our opinion , both of these are national matters .
this being the case , the need to respect the constraints of the Stability Pact , particularly in terms of national budget deficits and the debt reduction mechanism , cannot , as some would advocate , take the place of stronger coordination of economic and social policies and a policy mix which will impact on the economic policies of the countries of the Union , particularly the Eurogroup .
this also applies to those in the business sector , those who deal in cross border trade , and who do not evade taxes and therefore , who are not criminals .
similarly , installation aid for young farmers is a key component in ensuring the future of farming , particularly in the more isolated regions which have a structure of small family farms .
it is time for a dramatic change and the EU and the countries of southern Africa should be bringing more pressure to bear to bring about good governance in Zimbabwe .
the European Parliament has been saying since March that this will be our list of priorities for 2011 and that we would like those budget lines which favour youth , education and mobility to be appropriately funded , so that resources will also be found for innovative undertakings in the field of mobility , youth and education .
do we use less heating ?
Mr President , as has been said , the application of Community law does of course constitute nothing less than the decisive turning point in the European Union .
it was all of you , ladies and gentlemen , and we heard very few protests then !
trade , especially agricultural trade , is currently experiencing major problems as a result of veterinary or phytosanitary objections .
the Federal Government was still at a stage of development which we were unable to fully comprehend .
this is why I had no alternative but to abstain from this vote .
Mrs Bennasar Tous , the Council firmly rejects your interpretation of the Amsterdam Treaty .
in writing . - I voted in favour of the resolution on the EU-Russia Summit but I see no real progress from the Russian side to combat corruption , to apply the rule of law and international law .
Mr President , President-in-Office , you do not need a weatherman to know where the wind blows .
it is in this context that we must view the two taxation reports - the Cox and Pérez Royo reports - submitted to us today .
we all know how real the link between fatigue and the risk of an accident really is .
this text improves the balance between family life and work life .
this project was , incidentally , financed by the EU within the context of the HELIOS II programme . The result of the project , and the 16 exemplary national reports which were drawn up to provide a complete overview , are proof once again of how important and helpful the HELIOS programme was .
all the same , I propose now to enlarge on these categories .
either there is another crisis-provoking development in Europe - and not only in the euro area - or there is an attempt to create efficient economic governance based on cooperation between all the Member States , but also based on strong action taken by the Commission .
today , we must seize the moment ...
it will become a political issue again , and it is important for the European Union to intervene to keep the peace .
as rapporteur , she should have represented the views of the committee , where there was a very clear majority , and not sought in a number of ways to overturn what was clearly the will of a very large majority in this House .
Mr President , I should like to ask you to request the staff to compare the various language versions .
it is worth remembering that the uprising in Tunisia which set off the domino effect across the entire Middle East began with the self-immolation of a poor street food trader .
hence the importance of continuing to give the European Competition Authority the resources it needs .
Mr President , Commissioner , as Christian Democrats , and as the PPE-DE Group , our commitment to the defence of the value of human life and dignity , and the defence of the fundamental rights and freedoms required for that dignity , lead us once again to vigorously condemn the violations of human life and dignity represented by the death sentences - and , what is more , death by stoning - handed down in strict application of Islamic law ; and to urge the authorities responsible to show clemency in order to prevent the ignominy of the execution of such sentences .
let us make sure it is institutionally prepared on 1 January 2007 .
the regulation states quite specifically that European shipyards can only receive State aid if they are in direct competition with Korean shipyards .
it has always been in the Council &apos;s remit to consider ways of addressing the public &apos;s fears .
where the three pillars , in particular , are concerned , I am sure that there are many countries that – like my own – have the most enormous difficulties with the issue of ‘ access to justice in environmental matters ’ .
if Amendment No 4 is adopted , I would ask that the necessary steps be taken to enable Parliament &apos;s services to carry out the technical adjustments needed to adapt the corresponding recital .
furthermore , delegating anti-drugs measures to local and regional authorities could create &apos; islands &apos; in Europe which depart from national regulations and , hence , from the democratic will of citizens in the Member States .
as a representative of the Pensioners &apos; Party and of the elderly of Europe , I therefore request EUR 54 million to train teachers in how to teach pensioners and the elderly .
we must state clearly our opposition to Hamas using its power in the Palestinian Government to attack Israel to further its appallingly extremist interests .
we are in a world where , to look at one area , increasing biotechnological innovations are threatening farmers &apos; livelihoods in developing countries .
I would like to say to the honourable Members that the Community aspect has worked , though more slowly than I would have liked .
lastly , I note that some directives are being revised for the seventh time whereas others , such as Directive 79 / 409 EEC , have never been revised before .
as we know , the situation is certainly very complicated .
I am also delighted with the removal , on 9 March , of the wall which for decades separated &apos; the last divided capital in Europe &apos; .
and by the way , Mr Funk , we too are shrewd enough to work out that we cannot sterilize bulls &apos; semen if it is to achieve its intended purpose !
- Before the vote on Amendment 35 :
appropriate monitoring effectively depends on information that is both qualitative – concerning the practices adopted in actually applying the law – and quantitative , reporting on numbers of directives whose transposition or effective application is delayed by reference to established deadlines , or otherwise deficient .
we must also promote visionary projects , but we must guard against believing that there is only one solution to any particular problem or only one strategy for solving the problems .
I am under an obligation to act in accordance with the Group ’ s vote , and so , good democrat that I am , I am in favour ...
if the benefits of fisheries agreements are to be assessed in a comprehensible way , we must insist on a cost-benefit analysis - which must also consider the possible consequences of not having such agreements .
the predominant substances that deplete the ozone layer are found in aerosol propellants , refrigerators , insulating materials and certain specific solvents and cleaning agents .
what a great idea , but please let us drop this safeguard clause .
besides , it is easy to see that whenever the peace process was about to resume , the terrorist extremists went into action .
this is an issue of protecting our common values .
the EU needs a coherent industrial policy that conveys confidence to companies and helps them to overcome the crisis .
paradoxically , the management system is the only one that was not a fundamental part of the major reforms of 2002 and , because of this , the Commission has to paper over the cracks here and there , dealing with unsustainable discards , inventing control measures day after day and establishing recovery plans , but without tackling the substantive issue : establishing a coherent and up to date framework for the fisheries management model .
prices are among the main screening indicators .
I hope that we will vote tomorrow on a joint resolution tabled by several political groups , as well as on a number of amendments .
I tend to start the monthly part-session in Strasbourg in good cheer and in good physical condition , but practically every part-session I end up catching a hefty cold .

I would like to know whether or not this is true and , if it is true , on what authority you made these statements .
North Korea is a poor country , where most of the population go hungry and do not enjoy the living conditions we would all wish them to have ; yet their government goes on spending millions of dollars on an arms race and on achieving a nuclear capability of which it has no need whatsoever for the development and well-being of its people .
a meeting is held every six weeks or two months .
there must be exceptions that are very clearly defined , specifically as regards what we could call constitutional decisions .
without doubt , the question of life expectancy has repercussions on the actual retirement age as well as on the statutory retirement age in many countries .
if in Europe a third country aircraft is banned from landing in EU country A because of some particular technical fault , it simply diverts to EU country B. For this reason alone I believe that we must introduce common regulations to ensure the safety of aircraft passengers and crew .
instead of making a Europe of equal higher education , higher education in Europe has been turned into school education , where universities are no longer places of research and reflection , but learning factories .
I believe this issue – and I know my colleague Commissioner Patten shares this view – will be at the top of the agenda in our negotiations with the Afghan authorities in the near future .
what the inadmissible complaints should really do , then , is to present us with an opportunity to think about how we can create systems that offer the public a clear and cogent answer or the beginnings of a solution , both quickly and without red tape .
but this democratic scrutiny has , unfortunately , not been replaced by democratic scrutiny by the European Parliament nor , unfortunately , by codecision by the European Parliament .
in this way we are looking to address the contradiction between the positions currently espoused by members of the new Palestinian Government and by Hamas as an organisation and the EU objective of a negotiated solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , with Israel living side-by-side and at peace with a future Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders .
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( CS ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the European Court of Justice has decided that the direct application of community law , of freedom of movement and the principles of non-discrimination do not oblige Member States to eliminate legal double taxation arising through the mutual interaction of different taxation systems in cross-border situations within the Community .
Congo is a prime example of where great a development potential lies .
hitherto these were excluded by virtue of the old Article 13 .
I would say that you do not anticipate ways of managing appropriations which are adapted to the new needs .
what can be seen in all the work over this report is the lack of an analysis of impacts , and such an analysis would certainly have improved its quality .
finally , if a farmer - and that obviously includes a young farmer - can prove that his production has been reduced in the reference period because of force majeure or other unusual circumstances , then he can claim that his case is one of hardship .
I would therefore like to propose that the first step the Commission could take is to give those countries in North Africa that have begun the journey towards democracy free market access in Europe .
debates on cases of breaches of human rights , democracy and the rule of law ( announcement of motions for resolutions tabled ) : see Minutes
our financial control system does not have the quantity of payments that the Commission has and therefore things are more manageable .
hypocrisy ?
Mr President , before I came here for today &apos; s sitting , I was watching Finnish television .
at that stage , following a motion from Mrs Pauline Green , it was suggested that the matter should be referred to committee .
the Commission is proposing to provide Azerbaijan with financial assistance to help with social reconstruction .
we are , of course , in agreement with the main points in the communication , but in our report we lay stress on certain aspects that appear to us to be essential .
I have put forward three amendments myself : two involve minor corrections and the third is to restate the European Parliament &apos;s position , calling for the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports to become legally binding .
it is not the whole industry , but some areas of it .
trials have also been organised for war crimes , and considerable progress has been made on women &apos;s rights and gender equality .
I support the amendments , which improve the directive , but I cannot support the text as a whole - and the June Movement cannot support the text as a whole - because it still takes the country of origin principle as its starting-point .
together with representatives from the Commission and the parliamentary Committee on Development we have drawn up an action plan , which can be implemented by 15 May .
that has been gradually welcomed by the British Medical Association since 1993 and while we must work with the Commission and other agencies to scrutinize future proposals carefully and also consider very carefully remaining genuine reservations , it would be the right and responsible decision of this Parliament tomorrow to lead the way forward for an open-minded approach to tackling some of the very real health needs of citizens throughout Europe .
I agree with you , however .
only a few days ago , the Commission presented a framework programme on research and innovation .
I disagree with what Mr Purvis said .
they relate both to equality between men and women and to the principle of nondiscrimination on grounds of sexual orientation .
Mr Arif said that we should not water this down .
just come out and say it !
what we need is regulations – even with a potential review within five years – that can ensure the achievement of environmental targets in the long term , and the preservation of jobs in the affected industry and distribution sectors for the next five or ten years .
the negative elements are in the implementation .
on the eve of this grandiose sporting spectacle , the members of protestant churches that are not officially registered are being subjected to increasingly harsh religious persecution .
we will check it and take the necessary measures .
the much-vaunted practice of focusing does not mean continuing to produce the same contents under fewer headings .
the next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions concerning human rights in Ethiopia ( 1 ) .
ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank you for this debate and for the opportunity to consider with you some aspects relating to the use of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund .
that is why I want to launch the debate on the European research area immediately .
but these are not enough .
it is a good legal basis for budgetary spending in the EU .
I believe that this is a clear example of how I think Commissioner John Dalli will be working in the coming years ; we have here clear proof of how the consumer will be given all the rights he merits .
up till now there have been two distinct views on the matter , so it has not been worth putting this issue on the agenda of future meetings of the Council .
it is the peak noise values which are of interest as it is those which cause nuisance .
the problem is illustrated by the decision taken by the Swedish Government last week to reject the application by Nord Stream to take a gas pipeline through Swedish territorial waters in the Baltic Sea .
I wish the next Presidency luck in reaching an acceptable and balanced agreement – indeed , someone has already mentioned balanced agreements – taking into account Mr Böge ’ s report which was adopted by a very large majority of your Parliament .
so here we have a measure that I hope will soon be extended to other manufacturing and craft sectors , because I believe and conclude that this measure will bring Europe much closer to its citizens , and for this I thank the rapporteurs who have brought this measure into being , and the Commission and Commissioner Tajani for being a driving force behind it .
however , the package also contains some very unfortunate aspects that the previous speaker considered .
I consider it only right to mention the contributions from the general report by Mrs Cederschiöld and the report by Mr Schulz and Mr Bontempi .
obviously , the new information policy which we are going to be implementing will have to optimise the use of all the information and communication possibilities which this new technology makes available to us .
this is an initiative with which you are familiar , seeking to promote a substantial programme of investment in the sector of major trans-European infrastructure that includes transport , trans-European energy networks and the telecommunications sector , as well as investment in human capital , in other words in research and development , innovation and technology .
the fishing sector is now strategic - and will be more so in the future - as a food reserve : healthy and safe animal proteins for a growing human population .
as regards Chechnya and Dagestan , this is the long-term damage left by a brutal colonial regime , which we will only get to grips with little by little .
both reports contain general recommendations on how the EU Member States should conduct their economic policy .
going beyond this particular episode which the Rwandans see as traumatic , what is involved here is the culture of impunity .
their ability to do their job will be judged later .
it must be clear that European principles mean that our common neighbours have their own sovereignty in deciding where their future lies .
again , I would like to thank all colleagues who have been involved in this long , difficult but , hopefully , very fruitful outcome .
the EU fishing fleet is in operation throughout the world .
that is why I envisage that the recognition of these exclusive rights should be accompanied by the imposition on sports federations of precise duties and responsibilities relating to their obligation to serve the public interest and to redistribute their commercial revenue equitably .
as a result , one of the 4 regions of Latvia - Latgale - remains one of the most unprotected .
even the intervention of the public prosecutor of the International Criminal Court , who wanted to indict the Sudanese President and issue a warrant for his arrest , is to be a celebration marking the 10th anniversary of the Criminal Court .
therefore , there are many reasons why we must begin in the cities and , as I have said , we must not forget the rural areas .
with great calmness , I feel I can say that those who are against the proposal do not wish to give European citizens the same rights as Chinese citizens .
where I come from , in Rome , it is said that unless the construction sector recovers , the economy as a whole will not recover ; so why not promote this sector across Europe , wherever it can provide a significant number of jobs ?
in saying all that , we pay tribute as well to David Trimble who shares the Nobel Peace Prize this year with John , for the courage he has shown in more recent times in moving forward on the peace agreement for Northern Ireland .
the key message is that excluding millions of EU citizens from economic and social life is not smart , is not sustainable and is certainly not inclusive .
given the growth of illicit nuclear trafficking , it still seems legitimate to ask whether the European Union should not regard it as an urgent task to endeavour to get out of the nuclear industry .
on the other hand , the European statute of political parties at the European level opens the way for the creation of a transnational party system .
Member States have temporarily got around this situation by issuing type D + C visas , which allow the holders of a long-stay visa to move freely within the Schengen area for the first three months .
since we are debating two reports jointly , it would be impolite of me not to mention the report by Mrs Vincenzi , a report which we wholeheartedly support .
I would , however , point out that , according to the Maltese Constitutional Court ’ s definition , the notion of residence does not require a physical presence in the country , and in fact temporary absences from the country are both included and permitted .
what we have here is a unified , free and simple Community procedure , intended as it is , in part , for small textile companies representing , as one MEP rightly said , 90 % of the sector .
it was not easy to make clear that we cannot apply the same criteria to inland and coastal waters and lakes – such as Lake Balaton in Hungary – as we apply to the Atlantic Ocean .
in conjunction with the signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement , the FYROM government launched an action plan for reforms to speed up the comprehensive adaptation required by the agreement , but also to intensify the inter-ethnic dialogue and strengthen the position of minorities .
finally , we are going to have arguments here about jobs in the UK .
all we are trying to do with this question is make it quite clear that Parliament is not responsible , and that is why I think it is urgent .

one option is a purely internal political one that involves finding an alternative source which Bulgaria can use to meet its needs in other similar situations .
those sanctions – I would remind certain confused Members – were not implemented by the ‘ hordes ’ of the Group of the European People ’ s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , but during the Greek Socialist Government ’ s Presidency of the Union .
you are quite right to say that we should do everything to help to give the problem a European dimension .
I applaud that view and would also like to emphasise that this should just be the start of a greater focus on the sector , and I invite the Commission to implement a meaningful policy in this field .
these must be the absolute priority during the next round .
they must act , they must decide , and therein lies the weakness in our present situation .
I understand Mr Cohn-Bendit wants to say something about this request .
apart from the fact that it has taken nearly two years to present this proposal for a regulation , we have to recognise that an incentive system for developing orphan medicinal products has existed in the United States since 1983 .
Islam in particular has helped forge our identity as much through contrast with it as through the positive contributions it has made .
what I mean by this is not the question of Islam , but the challenge that our Europe is religious and secular .
you have said it very clearly .
 
in the light of the recent problems affecting NAFTA , one can draw the conclusion that limiting oneself to a free-trade area can lead up a blind alley .
we have an international agreement and it is being transgressed .

the second point which we consider to be very important concerns the second protocol on the liability of legal persons .

if we do not make the effort now , we will have to make it later ; but it will be more difficult later and it could even be too late .
what we are stating in our proposal , ladies and gentlemen , is that we can accept this pragmatic base tentatively and experimentally , but that we believe that the legal structure of the proposal is somewhat weak and that , in the medium term , based on experience , we should improve it and supplement it .
to combat this trickery , I myself , as a French citizen , brought an action for annulment , registered by the Court of Justice on 4 November last year , opposing the change of name of the European currency .
we should leave it at that rather than starting to include individual groups ; Article 13 should continue to apply .
today , here in this House , we are focusing on the domestic situation in post-election Ethiopia , and so the demand we have to make is no vague one : we must call upon the government to desist from deploying disproportionate force to suppress the opposition and the general population , and must release all political prisoners and journalists without delay .
it must be made possible for all of them to gain easy access to public transport , thereby saving them from the threat of isolation .
the Commission very largely shares the concerns you have expressed in your report and in the motion for a resolution before us this afternoon .
the EU must protest strongly against this .
closure of sitting
thirdly it proposed , and continues to propose , steps that must be taken to improve the implementation of this directive .
so the result does not reflect the financial priorities of Parliament .
I appeal to the European Commission to take more decisive action to resolve the problem .
it also leaves a rather unpleasant aftertaste to consider that Britain &apos;s Foreign Secretary Jack Straw was willing to send umpteen thousand British soldiers into Iraq to hunt down one dictator , while the same Jack Straw , when he was Britain &apos;s Home Secretary , decided to release another dictator , Augusto Pinochet , and thereby thus allow him to escape from the clutches of British justice .
the subject of market access is a salient issue for both camps .

we have therefore chosen to set what are ambitious minimum requirements which must be met throughout the Community .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
the Commission has based itself on already accepted international standards .
I share your impatience at the pace of progress and I intend to strive to increase it .
since terrorists ’ attacks are often planned many years in advance , these simply cannot be prevented by the storage of data .
this is why we believe it is important to find a new legal basis in the future .
it is not very generous but it guarantees a certain basic security for them .
there are always choices to be made by different countries and negotiators as to what form of negotiation they prioritise - the multilateral or the bilateral .
Mr Kallas , if option A , to which reference has been made of the two under consideration , namely the option that provides for a transfer of sections , were adopted , would there be a risk that many families would have their children in different schools ?
the one exception might appear to be the Budgets Committee &apos;s support for the performance reserve .
with regard to Amendments Nos 41 and 54 , the Commission accepts their logic and accepts them provided there are a few amendments to the wording .
the truth is that it is the citizens of Europe who will have to pay the price !
one last point , Madam President : how can European citizens give their consent and , in particular , under what conditions ?
if you look for civil justice in this , you find a bit of contract law dressed up as consumer law .

we in Finland are familiar with conditions in the Arctic .
when I speak to partners from outside Europe , I find that Erasmus is well known , especially now that Erasmus Mundus is seen as a competitive instrument used by European universities to make an internal and external difference to the image of Europe .
I believe that , in the dialogue between the European Union and Russia on human rights , the question should be asked of whether the indigenous Arctic people living in the Russian Federation get enough involvement in the work of the Arctic Council .
the side issue in this case is the petty quibbling of the national opposition .
the language used today in many documents is very often difficult to understand and inaccessible for the average citizen .
in addition , at Poland &apos;s request , the Commission has initiated a safeguard investigation concerning the import of frozen strawberries .
even with regard to its relationship with Kosovo , the Rule of Law is now apparently paramount .
we shall be voting on this next Thursday .
in 1917 Lenin , with the Russian Revolution , proclaimed Socialism for the 20th century , and it was a disaster .
despite sound preparations , this discussion of the budget appeared to be precarious last week because at the IGC , it transpired that a number of Heads of Government had had enough of parliamentary democracy and threatened to remove the budgetary rights which Parliament has had for over 30 years .
today &apos;s sitting is now at an end , so , with your permission , I would like to thank all our colleagues and you yourselves for what Mr Chichester has referred to as an even-tempered debate which has nonetheless been significant and which for me personally , I must confess , Ladies and Gentlemen , has been very encouraging .
Mr President , on 16 March 2004 the Commission adopted a proposal for a Council and Parliament recommendation on the protection of film heritage and the competitiveness of related industrial activities .
if this clear division between the Council as executive and legislature is not recognized and this leads to a lack of clear guidelines , then you can decide whatever you want about subsidiarity , but it will not make any difference .
I would like to thank Mrs Jackson , Mr Bowe and Mr Eisma for having contributed relevant points of view that undoubtedly improve the report .
the aim in particular is to promote women &apos;s entrepreneurial attitude and farming skills , equip rural areas with modern infrastructure which will enable women to achieve a work-life balance ( through the creation of day nurseries , for example ) , aim for a greater representation of women within political , economic and social bodies in the agricultural sector ( by making absolute parity the goal ) and implement adequate social cover for women working in agriculture as well as shared ownership of farms .
I can even go a step further and say that given that this is about media pluralism and given that media pluralism plays a significant role in promoting democracy in a country , the Commission is also taking this case particularly seriously .
at the beginning of July , we all followed with great concern the developments surrounding this small island .
increasing food prices would be socially unacceptable , given the proportion of the family budget already spent on food .
this crisis has broken out at a time of mutual distrust between the West and Islam and , I fear – mainly as far as the war in Iraq is concerned – that the West is to blame .
asylum policy is something close to our hearts , and not just because of the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
this would put our political dialogue on hold and interrupt our development programmes to the detriment of the poor people in Cambodia .
any mechanism that may help discover possible attacks is essential to success in this fight .
that , of course , is absolute nonsense , because that possibility already exists .
we do not want to open the floodgates and have hundreds of amendments rewriting lengthy resolutions by a committee of 700-and-something Members , but on the other hand a limited right of amendment where there is a strong wish for it , we felt , was a reasonable compromise and a right balance .
further , last year , in our 2006 communication on efficiency and equity in European education and training systems , the Commission stressed the importance of pre-primary , pre-school , education as an effective means to reduce school drop-out rates , and pointed to the dangers of tracking pupils too early .
we hope that we can get this office up and running as soon as possible .
that concludes the one-minute speeches .
in view of the World Trade Organisation Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong , we ask the Commission to insist that social and environmental clauses be introduced to prevent unfair competition from China , especially clauses which prevent social and environmental dumping , protect workers and the environment and actually place the safeguarding of rights above the movement of goods .
the political value of this directive is of a symbolic nature . This matter lies at the very heart of the building of Europe .
for example , the Court pointed out that , while the single-payment system facilitates application and payment procedures , it also has side-effects , such as entitlements being allocated to landlords who have never farmed .
that is why , in 2003 , the Commission adopted a much more rigorous approach involving procedural simplification and external audit , so that such transactions can be monitored better .
taken as a whole Mr Seppänen ’ s draft report enjoys the support of the Group of the European People ’ s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , but we will reject the substance of the amendments that were , contrary to our original agreement , resubmitted , and we do so on the basis of Articles 31 and 32 of the Euratom Treaty , which have to do with health and safety .
as the rapporteur rightly says , in some countries - such as my own , Spain - most cars are old and would be very expensive to upgrade .
there has also been the matter of interchange fees , which deserves to be tackled .
but that presupposes cedibility on the part of the intervening party , which must itself be respecting human rights in its own arena , in its own part of the world .
I would like to remind you that of all the countries that the European Union gives financial support to , Cambodia receives the most support per head of population .
it is a &quot; no , unless &quot; , as you have pointed out correctly , in the event that the system is not operative before the judgement on adequacy is confirmed , if these amendments regarding compensation for moral damage or damage to property are implemented and if we do not establish a right to cancellation or a personal right to judicial claim .
people are waking up to your intentions and the time will come that you are exposed .
the document recognises a number of points that would help to avoid similar problems .
if this is so , then we have to continue steadfastly with the obligations we have accepted , because Europe has a crucial need for success stories .
it is also why the United Kingdom Presidency will strive to secure a second reading agreement between Council and Parliament on the Energy End-Use Efficiency Directive , which will set a framework and targets for energy efficiency savings in the European Union over the coming years .
as is well known , the footwear industry is currently undergoing grave problems thanks to international trade liberalisation . This is primarily affecting those Member States with more fragile economies , including Portugal , some of whose northern areas are now running the risk of high unemployment and the blockage of their development , as the author of this question has recently witnessed .
in writing . - ( SV ) We vote against the report and the Commission proposal for the following reasons :
the court procedure against the AK Party and the mysterious Ergenekon proceedings present a picture of a deeply divided society that is neither willing nor able to meet the challenges presented by the European Union .
if we slide away from the common position and try to divide the recycling costs , we will be creating a loophole : we will not have created a rational , clear system in which the division of responsibilities is in order .
they live off leaves and roots and are so insecure they are forced to move their villages regularly .
Poland now has a completely new government .
we will continue to work together , but I have a feeling that at the dawn of the 21st century , with this framework directive , Europe is entering a new age where the protection of water , that most fundamental resource , will become a priority in terms of policy and the behaviour of all those involved , whether they be farmers , industrialists or consumers .
it is indeed important for a strong and united Union to leave for Doha .
we see , for example , that the infrastructure for CNG vehicles is still very patchy .
although the Community has no direct responsibility in the area of family policy , it is paying increasing attention to the analysis and understanding of the social and economic repercussions these new trends and social changes have on families .
you can never have 100 % safety , but this proposal will do a lot to make our seas safer , save lives and protect our coastal environment .
this is much needed .
I am aware of your concerns to improve the text of the common position on which there was unanimous agreement in the Council on 11 June 2001 .
it challenges us in Parliament , along with the Commission and the Council , to develop a far-sighted policy for the over-60s in the European Union , of whom there are already 75 million .
as regards simplification , this was one of the most difficult tasks I have ever undertaken , but we are pushing ahead as hard as possible on this .
the same conditions must apply to all countries we deal with , be they in Europe , Africa , Asia or anywhere else .
firstly , it is the car itself and all the systems that we are considering : systems for speed control , for stability control , for maintaining distance between vehicles , all these support systems , together with navigation systems , are all very important things that improve the functioning of the car , which is the tool that is used by those travelling by road .
anybody who reads the reasons set out in that report will be able to confirm that this aid is justified and needs to remain in place .
as a group , we have chosen to tread a fine line between the need to uphold the purpose of this mandate , and the need not to debase its political meaning .
in rural areas , moreover , they are included to a lesser extent in agricultural groupings and professional associations .
it could be complemented by a &apos; toolbox &apos; for Commission and legislator which should be implemented by an interinstitutional agreement .
I agree , and that &apos; more &apos; is to ask the question , &apos; Is integration the solution or the problem ? &apos;
they are showing cowardice and a lack of courage in dealing with this particular issue .
we are here to deliver our opinion at second reading and to look at the common position and the amendments which the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has unanimously adopted .
firstly , I believe it is important to ensure that the framework for the common foreign and security policy set out in the Treaty of Amsterdam is applied as soon as possible and as willingly and effectively as possible . However , I have noted that some people are pessimistic in this respect .
where Poland is concerned , the European Commission &apos;s actions have destroyed its shipbuilding industry and made thousands of people unemployed .
it was good to see EU leaders acting in unison and speaking with solidarity over dinner .
however , I must also say that future interregional and cross-border cooperation should entail no moves to create , or to demand the creation of , any additional tiers of administration .
this is unfair , and I call for a review as a mater of urgency .
during the presidential elections , it appeared that things were not running too smoothly , but compared to the rest of the region , Macedonia could serve as a model .
the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development should also be thanked for its almost unanimous support for this sector .
I hope that you understand this and will take the necessary measures .
the drugs problems requires pragmatism and an open mind .
for myself and many others , it is unclear how the Convention &apos;s proposal would work in practice .
by adopting an open and bold approach , we should be able to overcome these problems .
the experience in my constituency is that businesses see no sign of it .
it is vital that they start an open and significant process of political dialogue involving all democratic political forces and civil society as soon as possible , with the aim of preparing the way for real democracy , for the lifting of states of emergency , and for the implementation of real , ambitious and significant political , economic and social reforms , which are essential to long-term stability and development .
I think that the report is very well balanced , but I have some comments to make .
we very much hope that the meeting in December will give the Commission &apos;s service branch an opportunity to assess the situation on primates including wild animals as it appears in the Member States .
it was never the responsibility of the farmer , it was the food compounders who caused this problem and we have to ensure that it never happens again .
the proposal concerning security of supply does not appear to be in keeping with this .
these amendments are not about energy savings or environmental protection .
when all is said and done , this is an area that relates to health services and medical care and that should fall mostly within the competence of the Member States .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m.
therefore I propose extending the time frame of availability for these funds .
one cannot see why , in this context of austerity , they should receive public money from several different sources for these activities .
we are creating new rules , but I think that it would sometimes be much better to apply our existing rules so they can really achieve their full effect .
that concludes Questions to the Commission .
however , in my country and other Scandinavian countries , where we already have a relatively high retirement age of 65 - 67 , there is currently talk of raising the age threshold to 70 .
Mrs Muscardini , I gave the floor to everyone who asked to speak the first time round .
we have therefore signed some amendments that clarify how the funds are to be spent , in accordance with national legislations .
it is our duty to safeguard those values which are so dear to all of us .
hence , not for speculation .
we are well acquainted with its problems .
another key point is to maintain a CAP budget at least at its current level .
however , precisely because our commitment is a long-term one , I would foresee at least three major challenges .
in the meantime , this same Union must not renege on the humanitarian front .
in December 2000 European Union leaders agreed a set of Treaty reforms in Nice which they considered would be the best procedure for bringing about enlargement .
quite apart from the significance of this line of argument in political and military terms , it is important to recognise that it is an expression of American provincialism which leaves no room for a reciprocal international approach , in which countries such as Iraq are countered with international embargoes coupled with sanctions .
however , I would now like to draw attention to an area in which only EUR 2.7 billion was spent last year , but which causes significant problems .
finally , I would like to underline that by 2007 we will have made significant progress in establishing the information system and we hope to have the first results of the effectiveness of cost efficiency measures to address health problems .
your key task now is to ensure that there is life after Hong Kong .
it will also take account of the importance of creating a level playing field throughout the EU for these workers and , thirdly , the importance of showing our partner countries that we are ready to provide for the fair treatment of third country nationals legally residing and working in our Member States .
EEC-Denmark / Greenland Fisheries Agreement
I would like to end by emphasising that the principles of competence and geographical balance must be respected as part of the staff recruitment policy .
we have been journeying for a long time and we intend to reach a good destination .
this will require a trans-European referendum on a concise , clear text , which will focus solely on the values , the responsibilities and the workings of the Union .
however , we also want to add some specific areas of future priorities for European work .
I would like to underline that it is very important for the Commission and the European Union to reach an agreement with Comoros , as the agreement plays an important role in terms of the presence of our fleet in the region .
I trust that Sweden will also actively pursue the goal of a more open decision-making process .
some Members States of the Union soon forgot the commitments made to Nelson Mandela in Berlin in 1994 .
in the case of the report by my colleague Mr Poignant , we must welcome the inclusion of Article 299 , item 2 , of the Treaty as a legal basis and as an essential starting point for a new concept of the true dimension of the concept of outermost regions and for adjusting the ceilings for assistance .
the Commission will , within its sphere of responsibility , ensure that the incorporation of these principles into FIFA &apos; s rules is effectively achieved , and I am sure , Madam President , that the Commission will not be alone , but will be supported in this monitoring work by both the Sports Ministers and the Members of Parliaments who have made commitments at national level .
in writing . - ( SV ) Junilistan supports the Aarhus Convention , but we think that the national parliaments should determine their various positions on their own account during the conference on the Aarhus Convention in Riga .
our aim is for sufficient account to be taken of national systems .
for that reason , the action that can be taken at Community level can only be minimal and has to be clearly targeted in those fields where the Community can have an impact .
we succeed when we act as a Community ; we fail when we reduce Europe to the level of an intergovernmental enterprise .
the Swedish June List will reject this legislative proposal .
through this we will have a better-informed basis for the further inclusion of culture in European policies .
this framework decision approximates Member State legislation as regards acts of terrorism , offences relating to a terrorist group and offences linked to terrorist activities .
however , we should consider the fact that the person convicted in connection with organised crime who cannot justify his lifestyle should face the prospect of confiscation of property unless this person demonstrates that he obtained the property by legitimate means .
otherwise , all those who are here can bring their entire family , that is any number of relatives , while in the other case decisions are made on a case-by-case basis as to who has the right , on these grounds , to immigrate into the European Union .
nobody in the Council , neither the Presidency nor any Member State , supports the continuation , or even the occurrence , of fraudulent conduct in the internal market constituted by the European Union .
Europe has assumed a pioneering role by deciding to take action in this area , in conformance with the Kyoto principles .
the Group agreed a tough action plan , aimed at stabilizing the security situation in Kosovo , including immediate measures against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ; a clear list of the steps we expect President Milosevic to take within ten days to stop the violence and start a meaningful political dialogue ; and a commitment to review the situation on 25 March and , if necessary , adopt further measures .
the EU needs to consider these aspects in its action to combat terrorism and improve knowledge of the reasons for terrorist acts and radicalisation , which is currently limited .
- Before the vote on Amendment 990
I would just ask Parliament , and hope - as I will try to do in Council - to keep supporting the Constitution with the balanced view that we have to deal with a small number of outstanding issues as regards some countries and perhaps as regards countries that have declared their positions recently because of changes in governments .
although it may talk about the need to improve information , we were told at regular intervals that an enquiry had begun at Eurostat .
however , we disagree on the point which states that certification may be done by accredited agencies in return for reasonable certification fees .
also , while we are at it , why not have a geo-satellite positioning system so we always know exactly where we are on the roadmap and can better plan the journeys we want to take together by the most efficient and comfortable route ?
Mrs Jäätteemäki quite rightly puts particular emphasis on cultural cooperation , to which we , too , want to give greater attention in future .
finally , Mr President , I am a bit sceptical about taking up methods development at a political level .
together with our Ukrainian partners , we could , in the future , take the joint responsibility for gas deliveries on the Russian-Ukrainian border .
may I at the same time express the hope that a common energy policy will be written into the European Union reform treaty .
it is a calamity , and this calamity is exacerbated by the fact that , due to the expulsion of non-governmental organisations , only around 60 % of humanitarian aid is getting through .
in conclusion , and following the example of the rapporteur , I will add that we should be careful before announcing our victory .
however desirable closer cooperation in the area of the criminal law may be , having in mind the Europe-wide increase in organized crime , it must not be overlooked that the Agreement discards very significant basic principles of extradition law . Some of these latter also have the effect of reducing the protection provided by one &apos;s own citizenship .
the way to make progress in this area is to enhance their skills , for example , by channelling EU funds more effectively towards policies for young people .
already during this new parliamentary term , this Parliament has demonstrated that it takes democratic control and codetermination seriously , and I very much welcome that .
our relations with that great country merit an approach other than this headlong rush into double-speak , unworthy of us all .
however , acceptance of Amendments 23 and 49 , which propose a new definition and separate system for historical contaminated sites , cannot be supported , given that management of the sites in question does not come within the scope of the present proposal .
fact : stem cell research is tightly regulated under a stringent act of Parliament by the highly respected and rigorous Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority .
our solidarity should not be confined to our borders .
this is good , but it must be applied across the board .
do we listen ?
how much better it would be if that committee , and indeed all other committees , had left such legislation alone in its simpler and purer form in the first place .
it will continue to ensure that the credit market remains a domestic and local market , depriving consumers of all the advantages a single credit market could offer them .
such penalties must be effective and make it possible to block additional benefits or other advantages accruing to employers .
the following questions are addressed to the Commission .
the Lisbon Council said , and I repeated this in my report , that we need to encourage a regulatory climate which is conducive to investment , innovation and entrepreneurship in general .
the European Union &apos;s access to the Black Sea is important and , for this reason , I believe that , for the mobility of passengers and goods , it is also important to develop the railway .
I am also grateful for the cooperation that we have maintained during this last Ministerial Conference and I believe that , as has been said , this House must remain closely involved in the whole negotiation process , including the General Council in Geneva on 30 April .
Mr President , if the ARE Group had not made this proposal , we in the Group Union for Europe would have done so .
they offer a consistent and pragmatic perspective written in the light of the unemployment avalanche on our horizon .
however , this is the umpteenth update .
with them , we would have a real chance of getting a cultural offensive for Europe moving .
at the same time it is an extra stimulus for research into the development of FMD vaccines .
Turkish membership cannot therefore be dismissed on religious or geographical grounds .
I am entirely convinced that the cooperation that we have been able to put in place during this first reading and that follows on from the common position will enable us to reach a consensus with the Council and with yourself , and I am counting on you , Commissioner , to pass the results of this debate on to the Council .
the world is watching to see how its new government will manage its economic and social policies and to see if it will be a responsible partner as judged by how it deals with international concerns such as human rights and non-proliferation .
but I do not think , colleagues , that means we should stand aside and ignore what is happening at the moment .
if this debate is important , it is because with the signing of the Treaty of Lisbon last December and its entry into force planned for 1 January 2009 , the policies linked to fundamental rights and the progress made in the area of freedom , security and justice must and will undergo substantial changes , changes that Parliament - as you know , ladies and gentlemen - has been calling for incessantly for some years now .
this essentially implies discrimination , which is contrary to the spirit of a united Europe , a Europe that we were joining as new members , and is genuinely unacceptable .
we fully share Parliament &apos;s concern , also expressed in its comments on the Instrument for Stability strategy , that a security gap in this important humanitarian field has to be avoided .
there was sufficiency leeway in the agriculture budget .
we want to see genuinely independent investigation into reports of human rights abuses , and we want to see a real dialogue between the Russian government and the Chechens .
in view of what I have just said , I would recommend approaching it as a partner , engaging in dialogue with it rather than marginalising it .
I worry about the fact that no one is really talking seriously but , as I have just learned , there is to be another meeting , tomorrow , Friday , of 14 countries which are supposed to be participating in a multinational force , 14 countries which are spending their time wondering about exactly how they should participate and have still made no move .
it is all very well to argue for an end to the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure , but if we do not also have the power or codecision over the legislation , we are often left empty-handed .
the scientists who study these phenomena come from many and varied sectors : seismologists , geologists , oceanologists , forestry experts and others .
( FR ) Mr President , I shall not go back over a regrettable incident that took place yesterday in this House , an incident unworthy of this Parliament , in which Mr Van Rompuy was insulted .
the fact that it states that it can be done is not the point ; the point is that you are prepared , if Parliament so demands , to accede to that request .
many of the problems that Europe appears to have can only be tackled and resolved by a productive and virtuous relationship with all the Maghreb countries .
I agree with those who say a postponement of this proposal is a good thing , if it will then be watertight .
I also appreciate the rapporteur &apos;s clear main thrust for amendments , which is to make it easier for disabled people to have access to public transport .
I believe that , where this is concerned , we also have to very strongly highlight the area of the free movement of workers , where obstacles to the internal market still persist , affecting the truly mobile elements in the population .
we only need to carry out that process rationally .
in this regard , the political parties play a fundamental role : political parties that , in reality , have emerged from the parliamentary groups in this House , just as they originally did in the different national States as well .
to give just one example : congestion costs .
we cannot act as if there were always a clear division between such things .
that is why we firmly reject the British proposals to insert a third legislative chamber composed of national MPs , whose function would be &quot; to police subsidiarity &quot; .
the proposed adjustments , which allocate higher sums from the restructuring fund to growers , are good .
as the problems are global , obviously global solutions are what are needed .
there is a need to strengthen the European civil protection system , in order to be able to provide coordinated responses to tackle emergencies and contribute to a European Union capable of giving its own citizens confidence and safety .
the next item is the oral question to the Commission by Mr Lannoye and others , on behalf of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , on water and proteins added to chicken meat ( O-0045 / 2003 - B5-0099 / 2003 ) .
I am extremely concerned about the future of this sector since nothing is being done to free producers from the grip of market mechanisms alone , even though the European Court of Auditors has announced the need for tools to manage the milk market , at the risk of undermining milk production in a large number of vulnerable areas and of failing to see that it is through high added-value products that Europe can position itself in the world market .
the real stumbling block is the relationship between Turkey and Cyprus and the unsolved problem of Cyprus .
if decisions are to be taken concerning this both here and elsewhere , it is extraordinarily important that there should be clarity as regards what the Presidency of the Council and the High Representative are doing about organising such a mandate .
I hope that will be a way of having more commitment from the European Council for a strengthened mechanism of governance of the European Union 2020 Strategy .
we are saying that the initiative presented by Commissioner Kallas must include the recovery of Community funds .
Article 5 ( 1 ) of the Commission text proposes that the penalties for abusing a child under the age of 10 years should be more severe .
it will not lead to any progress .
this national distinction is , in my view , dangerous .
this report gives Ireland an allocation of 12 seats - three less than the 15 that Ireland had for the 1999-2004 term , which means we will lose 20 % of our quota from 2004 .
today , only a few Nordic countries in Europe attain that 0.7 % .
it tells us , for example , what a floor is , what is meant by &apos; behind &apos; and &apos; in front &apos; and informs us that provision must be made for passages through which two coaxial cylinders must be able to pass .
we need a more effective partnership between the Member States .
despite the fact that the Commission proposed this regulation in 2008 , only now has a decent compromise been struck so that the only mode of transport that still did not have rules to protect passengers now does .
last year , the European Council confronted an impressively high number of instances in which the action plan to combat terrorism was not put into effect . All it was able to do was appoint a representative of the Secretary-General , thereby adding , if need be , a new piece to a sort of institutional Meccano which is already failing to impress in terms of its transparency and , certainly , its efficiency .
what I mean is that , while the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) refused us an urgent debate on Uganda about the laws against homosexuals and another urgent debate on Iran about the executions being carried out there , they would now like us to get involved in the game of being for or against Ortega , with the demonstrations going on over there .
nevertheless , I should like to reiterate that the EU ’ s commitment , which I mentioned earlier , to vote only for countries who have a clean human rights record , is extremely important .
public administration , universities and business should pool their strengths and specialise .
Mr President , Europe needs a new strategy for dealing with the issues surrounding chemicals .
it is particularly the Council , the members of the Council , who are unwilling to grant frontier work the flexibility it needs , and so we politicians , national politicians that is , leave this for the European Court of Justice to solve .
the next item is the joint debate on :
the financing instrument for development cooperation is aimed at helping poorer partner countries in the field of trade and regional integration , the natural environment and the management of natural resources , infrastructure , water and energy , rural development , agriculture and food security , human development and social cohesion .
I feel shaken by the brutal murders of Russian activists such as Natalia Estemirova and Andrei Kulagin and others who were involved in supporting human rights and who advocated truth and justice .
the need for this report is highlighted by the hard reality of the trade deficit of EUR 160 billion .
if the Right had not just confirmed its rejection of the EU ’ s improved policy in respect of Cuba ’ s isolation by the US in a vote , despite criticism , I , along with Scandinavian and German colleagues , would still have voted in favour .
we have to import some of those products and a lot of them come from the United States , where many of the products are remunerated .
if we really want to create more jobs and achieve sustainable development and real social cohesion , we must create a mechanism in 2005 which not only ensures that the Lisbon objectives are put into practice , but should be accompanied by real incentives and big sticks in order to actually achieve those objectives within a framework that does not jeopardise stability .
that authoritarian capitalism may not evolve gently into the democratic and responsible capitalism we enjoy today in Europe and the West .
as I have already said , we will carry out an assessment of the effects of the BAM on the ACP countries 18 months before the programme expires .
that dream is a reality today and , for that very reason , it no longer inspires dreams , it has lost its capacity to make people dream .
it would appear the Messrs Jarzembowski and Ferber , in particular , have not quite grasped this point .
Erasmus Mundus is not a language programme : its purpose is to enhance the attractiveness of European higher education .
we shall not get a second chance .
this was a difficult compromise to reach , and is the outcome of lengthy negotiations within the committee .
the obligation of the EU - the Member States - to offer assistance in the field of administration and of police and judiciary systems , where this is requested , was also emphasised .
thank you , Mr President , Commissioner Barnier .
the directive which is currently being prepared should , in my opinion , have two objectives .
we need more investments , more growth , and more , flourishing businesses in Europe .
the directive is yet another monument to Fortress Europe , the materialisation of a reactionary utopia seeking to obstruct the freedom of movement of men and women .
I find that this is unacceptable , since referring to paragraph 2 implies the unanimity of the Council .
in order to achieve this , we need to do more than just disseminate factual information .
President Kabila changed course for a while and concluded fewer contracts with Western firms .
the military regime out there has made so-called concessions before , which later proved to be absolutely worthless , and this often happened just before an EU-ASEAN Summit , or just before the conference in Geneva .
some of this taxpayers &apos; money comes from German banks and it has also been lent out by German banks .
it was presented by Sweden , and invented by a British mathematician .
in today &apos;s debate , we have discussed how we have to have an ecological mind-set .
the Irish Government must be innovative and proactive in devising new ways of compensating for the reduction of EU regional and cohesion fund monies .
Mr President , to begin with , my sincere thanks go to the rapporteur , Mr Gahler , for his constructive cooperation .
in addition , we need to lay down new legislation in this field as soon as possible .
on the contrary , what is most important to me is the way that it shows that the Community method is able to conclude , exactly , precisely , and within a timetable , even as complex and difficult a project as negotiations on the accession of ten countries to the European Union .
moreover , it is enough to have one representative per Member State on the committees .
that is their role , they are elected to do so , they are paid to do so and none of them has any reason to defend the common interest .
the efforts of our partners in Australia , New Zealand and other countries of the region to restore democracy in Fiji will be undermined by this agreement .
in any event , I can assure Parliament that the Commission will want to join honourable Members in trying to persuade Senators to think again .
the Chernobyl disaster changed the public perception of nuclear energy , and many of those who live in the shadow of nuclear power plants are apprehensive about current levels of safety .
now we have the chance to turn the crisis into an opportunity .
I hope this House can support this resolution .
thank you for your attention .
the Commission would be in favour of the national authorities including , in their regional development plan , proposals on ways of promoting integrated development when making plans for the next programming period .
but we have to ask ourselves , are the figures now so low as to make the objectives unrealistic ?
but I am assuming that we will be able to use the margin for manoeuvre that is still available during the trilogue , and I ask you to support us here .
as Mr Kofi Annan has underlined , USD 1 billion will be needed immediately .
that is why it must be rejected .
unjustified attachment can of course have very serious implications for a debtor , and can even deprive the latter of the means with which to satisfy his or her basic needs .
is the Commission willing to initiate a sensible employment policy among the Member States supporting the European labour market with a European labour force ?
the Commission is delighted to have worked with the Austrian Presidency in preparing this meeting .
we are going to deal with a series of questions addressed to the Commission .
the first aspect concerns the Prince programme .
on the basis of its current assessment , the Commission does not , for the time being , intend to propose a directive along the lines set out in the above-mentioned Californian law , since it has not been demonstrated that there is a need for European legislation on that issue to supplement Member States &apos; legislation , in particular penal law .
the launch of a fingerprinting system by the Italian Government as an impetus to tackling the enormous problems resulting from mass Roma immigration into the country definitely has the support of the vast majority of the people .
the Greek Communist Party has abstained from the vote .
like us , it is a member of the Council of Europe and must thus respect its principles and values .
I know Mr Goldstone from when he was a great conciliator , carrying out and heading up many investigations in South Africa .
success in employment policy will of course be synonymous with success in economic policy .
– Mr President , unfortunately , cases of racism and violence are increasing , both in terms of intensity and frequency , not only in Poland , but also , unfortunately , throughout Europe .
Mr President , I shall draw to a close so that you do not have to ask me to stop .
I believe that India , faced with such a country , has the legitimate right to equip itself with the means to protect itself .
thus , new criteria are to be laid down for older people in connection with concluding insurance policies , booking holidays and hiring cars .
Mr President , I asked to be allowed a question as soon as the Commissioner began , and you are now telling me that the debate is nearly over .
in this connection , I should like to thank the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism for adopting one of my amendments adding the EDF to the list of these funds .
Argentina , Brazil and Uruguay will also be visited shortly .
the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens &apos; Rights has met a total of twelve times .
it is a brilliant exposé of Averroes &apos;s life and work .
as for Amendments Nos 5 , 38 and 55 , current WTO rules do not allow the Community to use animal welfare provisions as an instrument of trade .
so I am asking everybody in Parliament , but especially the Commission , to prepare matters as speedily as possible and in so efficient a manner that both the Council and Parliament can give their prompt agreement .
fourthly and lastly , let us not forget that this directive completes the overall system of type-approval for this category of vehicle .
Member of the Commission . - At this time of financial crisis and economic recession , both European governments and the European institutions need to show determination and flexibility , as mentioned by President Barroso in the preface to the recently adopted European economic recovery plan .
secondly , the ministerial declaration inaugurates a process to prepare the ground for a decision to be taken at next year &apos;s conference in the United States on further multilateral liberalization .
the events of 7 November - the declaration of the state of emergency , the violent police crackdown on demonstrators and the closure of the television station - underscored the extremely worrying nature of the situation .
regarding its proposal for all-Europe lists of candidates , we in Scotland - a small nation within a large Member State - are seriously concerned about the practical disappearance of Scotland as a distinct entity within the Union This would also apply to Euskadi , Flanders , Galicia , Andalusia and Wales .
however , it seems that there was a gap , not to say a gulf , between the promises made and the aid that in fact arrived on the ground .
Mr President , I would merely like to ask the House to support Mr Hume &apos;s resolution .
it also follows some of the CARS 21 recommendations , such as the integrated approach to the reduction of CO2 emissions , the need to ensure appropriate lead-times and the protection of the internal and external competitiveness of the European industry .
in this context , I would like to comment on two issues .
in this morning ’ s , the leader of the UK ’ s Liberal Democrats , Sir Menzies Campbell , said that Britain ’ s extradition arrangements with the USA were a constitutional disgrace .
close contacts with national patent authorities are of crucial importance for the purpose of information , public support and the dissemination of the information technology contained in patents .
that is why it is so important that all those disadvantaged groups know that Europe exists and that it can provide them with support in finding jobs , in gaining extra qualifications , in changing working conditions , and so on , and it is for that reason that I congratulate Mrs Jöns on this report .
I would urge Mr Prodi to call a spade a spade ; the Netherlands is one of those countries that play into the hands of the trade on account of its diverging policy .
- ( SV ) The main features of the text which has been debated today by the European Parliament are also to be found in a proposal which was presented by Mrs Lalumière in May to the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy and which was voted on in June .
legislation in itself is not bad , and this is not what the PPE-DE is saying , but it does not belong in this report ; it belongs in other reports .
thank you very much , Commissioner .
the other aspect of the Union policy is the issue of tobacco subsidies .
one-minute speeches on matters of political importance
I therefore support the proposal to simplify administrative procedures according to the level of grant .
so I think it would be a complete mistake now to be divided on this matter ; since we want to reinforce stability , I think it is important that we agree on this limited revision of the Treaty .
priority must also be given to food sovereignty and food safety , in particular by guaranteeing that natural and human resources are harnessed and that people have access to land and water .
negligence in transposing Community law in the past did not have the same repercussions as it has on a single economic area in which the idea of not having a uniform legal Community order at the same moment in time is inconceivable
the final text can be considered very satisfying and well-balanced , since it succeeds in guaranteeing passenger rights without simultaneously imposing heavy burdens on carriers , which are mostly small and medium-sized enterprises .
all this depends on improved security .
thirdly , I would like to mention the theme of partnership .
the EU will therefore attempt to promote a process in which , in partnership with the international community , Afghanistan &apos;s transitional government develops verifiable criteria and monitoring systems in connection with the considerable aid that is being given .
secondly , Europe must involve China in discussions on their respective African policies , but such cooperation obviously cannot occur over the heads of the Africans .
what we are talking about today is something entirely different .
I reject Mr Martin &apos;s assertion and , in my opinion , he should withdraw it .
the 10 years are vital to establish a uniform driving licence in Europe and combat real fraud .
this became clear during last year &apos;s elections in the Commission , when the calming and stabilising role of the European Union demonstrated the value of a sober but pragmatic European approach , defusing the tension and circumventing a painful and dangerous impasse .
Vice-President of the Commission . - ( DE ) Mr President , I was going to briefly comment on your last remark , but I have decided not to .
the work of EASA will have to help reduce these concerns .
we agree with the rapporteur &apos; s request for a more transparent and simpler system , which is intelligible to all the citizens of Europe .
I hope that this plenary will send a clear message by approving the proposal for a rejection , which I endorse and which was tabled by my group .
what is being taken here is a first step , and in that respect at any rate , Mrs Breyer has got it right .
the European Parliament could , through its own Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , take on the role of providing encouragement and an impetus in that direction , not least through collaboration with the national parliaments .
Mr President , in all my time on the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , this is the first time that I can recall that one of our major directives has received such prominence in the Parliamentary agenda .
contrary to what the critical voices say , the institutions and bodies deserve credit for their mainly cooperative attitude to the Ombudsman .
I think that the notion of corporate responsibility should be included in all EU policy and trade agreements .
because , when we consider the plight of the millions of citizens in Europe suffering in this severe winter , we cannot be calm here .
in 2009 , the world was gripped by fear of a virus with great pandemic and possibly deadly potential : influenza A. Fortunately , the worst fears with regard to the morbidity and mortality associated with the H1N1 virus were not confirmed .
how can we agree to an agreement that is being negotiated in backrooms ?
we must listen carefully to the initiatives that have been announced in the strategy for the future of customs union and be prepared to support any measure that will make them even more efficient , especially in combating counterfeiting and organised crime .
the next item is the report by Zdzisław Kazimierz Chmielewski , on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries , on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a multi-annual plan for the cod stocks in the Baltic Sea and the fisheries exploiting those stocks - C6-0281 / 2006 - .
as we say in Ireland , you could bet on two flies going up a wall .
the Russian Federation believes that the presence of its troops in countries in the region is acceptable and that they even have the right to intervene when Moscow considers it necessary .
I therefore welcome the EU decision to allocate EUR 200 million in aid to South Sudan in order to help the most vulnerable segments of the population .
and if the aggressors include working-class people , all we can say to them is that , in acting in this way , they are digging their own graves .
finally , and this is the most important thing , we must agree on the future financing of the Union .
the situation in China in recent times can be described as a highly explosive mixture of Communism and capitalism .
but it does not relieve farmers of the business decision ; it does not relieve me , as a manager , of the responsibility of taking the necessary decisions in my company to ensure its long-term existence in the light of the current conditions .
these processes should include necessary maintenance and surveillance following shutdown , waste treatment , waste and spent fuel storage and decontamination , the environmental upgrading of facilities , and support for replacing the production capacity of shut-down plants , paying particular attention to environmental sustainability and energy efficiency .
the next item is questions to the Commission ( B4-0260 / 98 ) .
it is bad if the electorate treat this Parliament with indifference .
what does the real future look like on paper ?
but the figures we already have also show that there has been insufficient take-up of the programmes .
we have responsibilities towards it , just as we do to all other basin regions that border us .
the concept of a really competitive European agriculture in the world market without subsidy is far from the Committee &apos;s thinking .
but that in turn has nothing to do with the 0.5 % payment threshold , which also already exists under the present system .
first of all let me refer to Amendment 15 and to say that I wish to stress that ethical issues are outside the competence of the EU .
Madam President , I should like to say that I share Members &apos; special commitment to the Middle East .
this figure is 20 % in countries such as Latvia and Spain .
in my experience as an MEP , this is not the first time I have had to face such a question .
this raises a question I would like to ask about the basic right of those eventual members of future generations - to be born .
but there has never been a Council common position or joint action under the CSFP calling for the closure of Guantánamo Bay or even just for the return of our own citizens and residents .
we are reading and hearing rumours that are rather dangerous .
I undertake personally before this House to rigorously enforce our criteria and conditions .
since the proposed ratio of 1 : 20 between the highest and lowest noise charge was insufficient , the rapporteur suggested increasing this ratio from 20 to 40 , which is wholly acceptable .
the atrocities , the expulsion and the genocide in Kosovo and the sometimes unpleasant way in which some Member States are dealing with the displaced persons who need our support illustrate once again that we need a harmonised policy on refugees and asylum , but one that must be humane in accordance with the Geneva Convention .
Mr President , I would like to thank the honourable Members who have applauded the initiative of the Spanish Presidency of the Council in making support for electric vehicles a priority in the Presidency &apos;s programme .
Member States who have only recently introduced a completely different tax system , for example a flat-tax system – that is , a single rate for company taxation , income tax and such like – have difficulty supporting a uniform assessment basis .
what we are being called upon to debate is when , how and with what environmental impact we decide to mine it .
with this in mind , we would warmly welcome a commitment by both the Government of China , in particular , and the Dalai Lama to resolve the Tibet question through a process of dialogue , and wholeheartedly hope that such a process , if brought about , will lead to a successful resolution of the Tibetan problem .
not using the criterion of miles offshore means that the connection with national exclusive economic zones can be ignored or minimised as something to be forgotten .
whilst we wish to commemorate the end of the second world war in Europe , this document amounts to a re-write of history , even stating in the title that World War 11 ended on 8th May 1945 , which it did not as the world still faced Japan .
if we were entirely dependent on the Council for ensuring economic coordination , there would never be any economic coordination .
how do you interpret Article 105 of the Treaty which , when price stability has been achieved , asks you to support the economic policies of the European Union and its objectives as defined in Article 2 of the Treaty ?
the problem , however , is that these countries must start on the difficult journey which we in the West have already completed .
we are voting against the amendments concerned with the setting-up of a Community database , comitology and continuing training programmes .
this body , which consisted of the Commissioner responsible and the relevant committee chairs , has not yet been convened .
since the EU is the world &apos;s main donor of external aid and responsible for more than half of public development aid , it needs instruments that allow it to deal with crises , taking into consideration the EU &apos;s horizontal and geographical objectives and priorities , while simultaneously complementing the Union &apos;s geographical policies , objectives and instruments .
they do not reflect a sensible and balanced approach .
that should not prejudice their private or public status , but allow them to be run as non-profit-making bodies and be accessible without discrimination to all users .
that is why , when voting on Mr Fayot &apos;s report , I believe that , in the trialogue and in the dialogues we are having with the other institutions , the President should assert our wish for fair cooperation , and should , however , also inform all the other institutions : for example , Council should be told clearly that Parliament is also prepared to do this provided Council is prepared for other forms of cooperation , such as cooperation with the Committees of Inquiry or with other sectors deserving fair cooperation , the cooperation we are prepared to provide and which we would also like to see from the other institutions , from Council and - if Commissioner Kinnock will allow me - from the Commission as well .
once again , my thanks and congratulations .
the European parties which are stuck in the past have shown that they are incapable of overcoming the short-sightedness which makes them blind to the internal national and regional realities of the current Member States .
the Union must be ready to provide help , and our efforts are needed to promote security and stability in Eastern Europe .
after all that is why the WTO was necessary , because , as it kept being impressed on us , the USA and let us say Swaziland had to be subject to the same rules .
I therefore believe that these points are essential to this Parliament , and I would like to pre-empt events slightly and inform the Council that we will be able to back these three principles when we leave for conciliation - hopefully unanimously , or at any rate jointly .
in this Parliament - and in all the EU &apos;s institutions , including the Commission and the Council - people consistently and with an almost religious zeal follow the once adopted map and ignore the terrain .
I find it regrettable to see who will be required to register in order to obtain a one-year building pass - the list includes public institutions and bodies .
in these same conclusions , the Council emphasises that it is important to strengthen technological research and development at European level as an indispensable complement to the efforts made at national level , and it draws particular attention to the need to exercise a powerful leverage effect on private investment in research – an action the responsibility for which falls in large part to the Member States .
Mr President , I would like to make explanations of vote on two reports combined : on the Cappato and Cederschiöld reports .
at this time , the language courses at the Commission and the Council were delivered by internal trainers who were granted private law contracts , without any call for tender or selection procedure .
today &apos;s debate is another step on the road to establishing the final form of the European Citizens &apos; Initiative .
the Commission is ready to consider the use of ICT within the existing priority areas and cross-cutting themes - if and when they are cost-effective in achieving stated objectives , and indeed that is increasingly the case .
as I see it , there is a great deal to be done , and those who want to work constructively on this issue are invited to take the proposals put forward by Commissioner Diamantopoulou and Mrs Ludford as their true example , and to disregard , or give a wide berth to unsuitable debates in plenary session , with a view to making progress in this area .
this a very sensitive issue .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , we consider Russia to be an important partner of the European Union .
their leaders have come to me and complained of a worsening situation , regrettably , in Egypt , orchestrated by the Muslim Brotherhood .
Mr President , before turning to congratulate you , I should firstly like to say that the whole House was honoured by having such a distinguished European and unflinching democrat as Mr Soares chairing our presidential elections .
I very much agree with all those speakers this evening who have remarked , albeit in differing terms , that consumers are the protagonists of the European single market .
lastly , Europe &apos;s significant efforts to help solve the Haitian problem will have been decisive .
we must also admit , however , that a great deal has gone wrong since this triumph .
subject : Swedish policy on alcohol
I could also mention that this macro-financial assistance , if it is given to any of these states , should also go through the consultation process via the European Parliament .
this agency must be equipped with the resources to undertake this task .
this misguided change of emphasis has made it possible for criminal organisations , most of them originating in non-European foreign countries , to extend their influence and become decentralised .
the other week the process of ratifying the Peace and Security Council Protocol in African Union Member States reached the point where this institution is now being formally launched .
I believe his work is very valuable and I am aware how important it is to our citizens because his office has become a key point of contact for them .
the 10th anniversary of UN Security Council resolution 1325 is an opportunity to make progress in these areas , as are all the ongoing reviews of EU policies , particularly on human rights and combating violence against women , the use of children in armed conflicts and the fight against all forms of discrimination .
I have a list here from five years ago which provides some deadlines .
the latter are tightening up policy in a vain belief that this should ease the problems , make integration a smoother process and lead to fewer people reaching our borders .
we should therefore like to raise this issue once again , and make it clear to audiences and to society during Euro 2008 this month that this type of violence against women and girls is unacceptable .
I might add that all WTO members should , in fact , do likewise .
I voted against the Pérez Royo report on taxation of savings because it is the best way to ensure that savings leave the European Union .
the report proposes the simplification of financial monitoring and control and the strengthening of technical and scientific evaluation by means of peer review based on excellence .
enlargement in the form that you are undertaking it , however , simply enshrines the hegemony of the major capitals of Western Europe over the poorest and least developed countries .
the Hungarian Presidency has always believed that , besides the necessary fight against discrimination , a new policy mix is necessary , with three key elements : employment , education and housing .
stigmatisation and incitement to hatred on the grounds of religious affiliations are considered offences in France and this situation is equivalent to flagrante delicto .
we should not aim for the impossible , for example setting up common bodies or harmonising legislation .
I can assure you that it was the very same for the Council .
the debate is closed .
judging from the informal preparatory work which has already been done in connection with this process , it looks as if the recommendation from the Court of Auditors - the introduction of direct income aid for tobacco producers - is not going to be implemented ; it looks as though the Commission will not actually submit this proposal , never mind the Council accept it .
I have reported on the humanitarian aid being provided by the EU to those who require it in Serbia , and the other questions in fact lie outside the actual discussion of humanitarian aid .
does it consider the statements which we have all heard from certain heads of government , claiming that the world is safer today and there is less risk of terrorist attack , to be valid ?
at the end of 2006 the President of Kazakhstan , Nursultan Nazarbajev , came to Brussels .
we have made a number of proposals asking the Commission to allow simpler labels to be affixed to textile products .
so answers have to be found to pressing problems : the development of piggy-back transport , definition of anti-pollution standards , and so on . These observations apply to all aspects of communications in and around the Mediterranean basin ; the same problem arises in our relations with Switzerland , and this is something I should like to touch on , ladies and gentlemen , both on my own account and on behalf of my group .
secondly , do the Commission and Council accept that going down this blind alley of mass surveillance and collection of personal data on everybody - 99 % of whom will be completely innocent - risks being a distraction from trying to catch the 0.1 % who may be a terrorist danger or an organised crime suspect ?
nowadays , the main challenges of the nuclear industry come from waste and the ageing of structures .
EUFOR troops should therefore be deployed specifically in these crisis areas .
the Irish presidency representative , Ambassador Kester Heaslip , visited the region recently and had contacts with representatives of all the interested parties .
the US Fed has all of these three criteria in its definition of what the Fed should be concerned with .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
even in the regions of the ACP countries , the effects of climate change could turn out to be disastrous .
indeed , what is happening through this process ?
I certainly understand the reasons for all these amendments that relate to funding , but is it necessary to try and resolve all of these funding problems in the context of a technical regulation ?
I have allowed the request for a vote on it .
but I believe that we should be careful about using the same schemes that we are applying to Mercosur , Chile and Mexico for other regions of Latin America .
producers and consumers must realise that the current debate is primarily a debate among scientific experts , who must be allowed to make their case freely .
if the Spanish Government wants more money or assistance , we expect it to contact us to determine exactly what should be done .
the vote will take place on Tuesday , 18 January 2011 .
to date , the Generalised System of Preferences ( GSP ) has guaranteed the ACP countries preferential access to the EU market , with lower import tariffs at the EU &apos;s borders and better market access .
the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction truly represents a serious threat to mankind , to peace and to international security .
before the vote on Venezuela :
if they had an alternative , they would only disturb the economies of the sectors they were converted into .
I hope Commissioner Van Miert will continue with this line in the decisions he takes at the beginning of next year .
the report contains a large number of good , important points .
it will certainly be no easy matter to identify minimum standards , for two reasons . The first relates to the practical problem posed by legal codification , for a complex process will have to be launched to approximate the - at present , extremely diverse - laws of the Member States .
this proposal for a regulation establishes a framework of measures for the purposes of implementing the common fisheries policy , complementing the proposal for a Council regulation on the European Fisheries Fund ( EFF ) , which we debated in the Chamber some months ago .
it is now also beginning to be recognized as an important question in the applicant countries too .
it was truly regrettable to see how Community actions were being implemented , sometimes without even an awareness of what each of the Member States was doing in relation to the relevant countries or sectors .
however , the ECR has consistently been against setting quotas for women within national , regional and international institutions , as well as the establishment of the European External Action Service ( EEAS ) .
inter-state cooperation must therefore be carried out more actively , so that Islamic extremists can have no sanctuary .
we did not all agree on it , there was no unanimous agreement , but rather it was the maximum possible compromise to which the 27 Member States would agree .
I trust that Germany will not now be accused of having lost touch with reality because it is making this very same proposal .
I share the wish expressed by both the Commission and the Member States to enhance the quality of statistical information .
as regards the least-developed countries and the ‘ anything but arms ’ initiative , the Commission insists – and this is also related to the future price – that a quota system for those countries would not be realistic .
( applause )
if we are firm in our criticisms and our proposals , we may cause a little alarm today but we shall serve a purpose tomorrow .
( applause )
I have agreed with this report because I believe it puts into practice a large number of declarations of intent on the protection that should be given to many of those who every day are defenceless victims and then see themselves summarily expelled from the countries where they thought they could have a worthwhile future .
we say that everything that falls within the EU context will stay as it is ; each Member State can do what it considers right .
this is a vital point , in that resources are the overriding problem in our attempt to achieve common standards and respond to public health requirements .
in principle , harmonization of the authorization and use of food additives in the European Union is to be welcomed .
in writing . - ( LT ) I voted in favour of this important document .
on distillation , the approach - which is the same as that adopted by the Commission - is absolutely right , namely that we need to cut back on compulsory distillation and that here too we need to introduce a little more market , but that we should keep compulsory distillation as an instrument , to be used in the future where it proves to be necessary .
in other words , they have maintained the stigma of collective guilt for the Sudeten German and Hungarian ethnic groups .
if these presidential elections are conducted the same way as the elections and referendum of 17 October , there is no doubt that he will succeed in this .
this measure is designed to release that sum and to fund projects for restructuring and improving the efficiency of homes and public buildings , street lighting and urban transport systems .
that an Arab country should make very definite progress in these areas is important for the Arab world as a whole , and so are the positive steps that have been taken in recent months , and we do – as we should – acknowledge them , such as , for example , the opening up of the prisons to the International Committee of the Red Cross , the appointment of a mediator and the amnesty for political prisoners .
it is right to point out that marine biology resources are a common public good and that such rights ought not to be interpreted as property rights .
of all of the interesting things it says , I would like to stress just one : the need to enhance South-South trade . The need for the European Commission to be directly involved in the efforts to enhance South-South trade .
the Union can no longer ignore this problem .
on top of this , there is an increasing awareness of the climate change agenda .
to be precise , it is the fault of the people in charge of the system .
the new College of Commissioners is the first complete European Union team made up of 27 Member States .
in a time of economic crisis , when many EU citizens have lost their jobs , the running of institutions funded from their taxes is a highly sensitive matter , and it has to be said that this is perfectly justified .
accordingly , it must be a genuinely European mission , and as such we welcome the news of the solid participation of various Member States led by Germany and including my country , Portugal .
we cannot watch from the wings while Europe consistently lags behind the United States and other global challengers .
today ’ s debate concerns the report by Mr Marinho , whom I should like to congratulate on the quality of his work .
however , in my opinion , these rules must necessarily be subject to two conditions , which are no more than two sides of the same coin : ( i ) on the one hand , they cannot be more restrictive for European producers than for their international competitors , which place their products on the same market without complying with the same rules ; and ( ii ) they cannot be so exacting that they jeopardise economic competitiveness .
I would like to conclude by saying that I attach great importance to item 18 in the Whitehead Report , namely access to affordable and high-quality services of general interest .
we need qualified legislative experts in all fields in order to balance the Commission .
it is very important for us to play a supportive role - perhaps not as important as the role others such as the United States , China and Japan are playing - but nevertheless an important role in reconciliation in the Korean Peninsula and in encouraging North Korea to join the rest of the human race .
more and more people are rightly expressing concern about the level of additives in food and about the long-term consequences of their use .
last but not least , the requirement that the Member States cooperate with Europol needs to be enforced more strictly .
other conditions must be met , in particular sound fiscal policies and appropriate structural reforms .
this is a question from the people on the spot .
secondly , the European Year of Lifelong Learning highlighted the Commission &apos;s difficulty in providing information and responses and being transparent .
as our colleague recalls , birth control alone cannot solve the population problems facing the world , and more particularly the developing world .
the Transnistria conflict is one of the most significant reasons for the slow rate of economic development in Moldova .
however , all is not in vain .
in addition , we must maintain our criticism of the foreign policy of the European Union and its Member States , not that it is always easy to detect such a policy . All too often , it is governed by ethnic prejudices , as in the case of Bosnia and Albania for example , and not by a true spirit of cooperation and development that is independent from the purely economic aspect .
subject : Promoting sustainable energy in cities
I can therefore state looking back that the five years I spent as a house husband looking after two boys were , without doubt , among the best years of my life .
the majority of the members of the Union for Europe Group support that step , but nevertheless stress that it must not be imposed upon Member States of the European Union that do not wish at present to be associated with it .
it is about implementing measures for the Fuel Quality Directive and setting baseline or default values for greenhouse gas emissions for transport fuels .
many times , for working purposes , it is addressed as a tax exemption issue , which creates some confusion .
while I have not checked the record , from my own memory I believe Prime Minister that you may have been here on the floor of this House more often than any of your predecessors in any previous Presidency .
if the peace process moves forward , we shall be able to undertake a major programme of economic cooperation ; if it remains stalled , we shall be faced with the kind of difficulties which I do not need to spell out to you .
this criticism of the report is in no way a fundamental rejection of the proposed funding model ; it is , however , intended as a clear signal that , in its existing form , it simply cannot fulfil its purpose - the practical implementation of the specifications of the White Paper .
that is contrary to the Amsterdam Treaty and therefore illegal .
as Mrs Pack has said , this serves as a basis of reform for many countries in the Western Balkans , the new Member States , and even in the old ones .
the promotion of sustainable transport is a key element of the common transport policy .
the spectre of the repairable society is on the loose once again in Europe .
we must continue to press China on these issues , but a refusal to recognise any progress positively discourages those progressive and liberal forces within the regime who are trying to push further , because they get no recognition for what they have done already .
concerning the questions by Mr Kaczmarek and Mr Audy : the ultimate objectives of the scheme are indeed education and the eradication of poverty .
there is only one request where there is some doubt .
I do not , however , accept – unlike some Members of this House – that this ban can be automatically extended to the legitimate military use of other munitions , such as anti-tank mines , as they , for instance , are less readily available to non-regular forces , because they are much more expensive and tend to be laid in a well-mapped and systematic fashion , which enables speedy clearance in peacetime after the cessation of hostilities .
given the massive financial and economic potential of these countries , we have to make use of the current context if the negotiations are to reach a successful conclusion .
unfortunately that has almost become a utopian objective today , but we will achieve it .
let me say a few words about the process .
it showed a lack of vision and a lack of respect , from what one can see .
( Loud applause )
I have to say to you , Commissioner , you have not convinced me this evening .
tourism must not run dry , which is exactly what will happen if there is a civil war .
our word should be our bond .
there must be an emphasis on providing European added value .
in particular , the Council and the Commission are already agreed on the need to better coordinate on the ground in a regular and structured manner , making the best use of pooled expertise .
as such , it needs to assert its position and ensure that it is capable of meeting the mobility and transport requirements , increasing productivity , improving safety and benefiting the environment .
this is why it is necessary to define global standards for data protection , security and freedom of expression through continuous cooperation between Internet operators and Internet users .
the European Union has taken actions in this respect , targeted at agriculture , adapting to climate change , forestation , the management of marine resources and coastal areas , as well as water management .
personally , I am bewildered that , when looking at implementation of the budget for 2008 , we received documents for 2007 , and so absolutely not in accordance with our expectations and requirements .
we reject the initial proposal presented by the Commission that the full cost of water services - such as infrastructures - should be recovered from the users , who are mainly farmers . We also reject the proposal that the costs must be taken into account , since this could ruin the already fragile agriculture in the south .
in the European scheme of things , this is comparatively small beer .
following on from the joint resolution which Parliament adopted at the last plenary session on the subject of aviation , the key areas for amendment to this text are as follows : first , Member States assume responsibility for additional security costs in the light of the terrorist attacks ; second , inspections of airports should be unannounced if airports are to be inspected under real operating conditions ; third , Member States take responsibility in assisting employers in the screening of employees engaged in all security tasks , not least because employers are not always entitled to access personal data due to strict privacy laws ; fourth , where there is a requirement for structural modifications at airports a six month time-limit will be implemented ; and fifth , that a procedure be formulated , as is currently the case in ECAC , that would allow industry access to the Comitology Committee without running into problems of existing legal structures .
the Armenian issue cannot be sunk into oblivion as these negotiations become part of history .
how will this continue to be organised or coordinated ?
it provides for an immediate ban on penta- and octaBDE and the banning in 2006 of decaBDE , unless - and this is important - it is proved to be harmless .
Mr Solana made a passionate plea for an open debate of this kind a moment ago .
do you not think that in the interests of greater transparency the offending organization should have been named ?
I hope that some of the Member States recognise that maybe they could do with holocaust denial legislation as well .
there are some who support complete liberalisation and others who advocate partial liberalisation , while others again are essentially opposed to liberalisation .
as regards Amendment No 23 by Mrs van Dijk , whom I would like to congratulate , I must say that I accept it in full .
we have seen an abnormal number of applications for software patents in the United States , and there are probably just as many in the EU , and this makes it clear that we are not dealing with genuine inventive activity and that we cannot afford to grant every type of application a patent .
it is my firm belief that we must spell out what we mean .
